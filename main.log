<p>Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the
broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing
by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from
tightening monetary policy last week.</p>
<p>EUR/GBP hit 0.8344, the highest since February 6 and was last up
0.48% to 0.8341.</p>
<p>The pair was likely to find support at 0.8291, the session low
and resistance at 0.8360.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB
left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday,
saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the
low inflation outlook for the euro area.</p>
<p>The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB
showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its
emergency loans this week.</p>
<p>Overall market sentiment remained subdued after data released
over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a
year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a
6.8% increase.</p>
<p>A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed in February, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in the
world's second largest economy.</p>
<p>Sterling was also lower against the dollar, with GBP/USD down
0.40% to 1.6647.</p>
<p>Data on Friday showing that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs
in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs continued
to support the dollar.</p>
