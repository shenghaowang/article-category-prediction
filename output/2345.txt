pilots applied procedure

pilots apparently notice aircraft reached maximum permissible altitude
pilots read available data vertical velocity altitude etc
pilots comment stall warnings apparently realize aircraft stalled
buffeting associated stall
stall warning deactivates design angle attack measurements considered invalid case airspeed drops certain limit
consequence stall warning came whenever pilot pushed forward stick stopped pulled back happened several times stall may confused pilots
