official candy crush hard study reveals game belongs group complex mathematical problems
none candy crush saga involves swapping candies make rows three
none study wanted test whether game whats called nphard
none np problem difficult check solved pc
none test theory researcher constructed theoretical board candies
none tried establish generic formula solving puzzle
none involved trying prove whether certain score could achieved set number swaps
none wasnt easy solve meaning game classified npcomplete
next time someone criticises playing much candy crush tell youre actually solving complex mathematical problem
australian researcher toby walsh wanted test whether game whats called nphard difficult solve without computer
test theory constructed theoretical board candies able turn logical math puzzle meaning strategy could classified alongside complex problems confirming np
game difficult
put simply starting board candies two instances row three made player decide row complete first selected row sets chain reaction directly influences candies fall game continues game solved player would need start time choose row option determine route scored highest points make informed mathematical decision row choose however requires knowing candies appear row completed time candies fall create number new row options increasing number possible outcomes check best score player would go back possible outcome rows follow producing puzzle cant solved manually
candy crush saga hugely popular game players move different coloured candies around board create lines three row
line three matching candies completed disappear candies drop top screen fill gaps
early rounds involve making number swaps set timeframe achieve minimum score
due large number variables toby walsh university new south wales wanted see whether game p math problem np problem
p problems puzzles easy solve np problems much difficult solved computer large amount data produced
test theory walsh constructed theoretical board candies size board unrestricted
tested whether possible create sequence swaps k obtained specific score
board candies two instances row three made player decide row complete first sets chain reaction directly influences future moves game solved player must start numerous times try possible swap options
turned game mathematical problem process trying solve formula walsh concluded variables possible outcomes level high computer would able process information c making puzzle np npcomplete
npcomplete puzzles solutions applied np problems finding one solution difficult
example walsh found solution candy crush problem theory solution could applied puzzles large number variables outcomes
strategy also used prove games including super mario brothers zelda also nphard
part may candy crush computationally hard puzzle solve concluded walsh
