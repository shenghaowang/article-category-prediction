wonderful back scarborough say back many earliest fondest childhood memories summer holidays spent cricket fan scarborough festival cricketing jamboree held end august year since always held place imagination alas never hoping one day break duck
want discuss economy role monetary policy supporting apologies audience borrow cricketing metaphor corridor uncertainty corridor uncertainty every bowlers dream every batters nightmare refers ball pitches position corridor batter know whether playing back foot front foot
argue similar dilemma facing monetary policymakers banks monetary policy committee mpc today monetary policy hold back key sources uncertainty economy resolved instead push forward prevent leaving late
lets start since 2007 uk global economy faced barrage financial bouncers frightening pace ferocity economy back foot much period output growth uk fell short banks mainstream forecasters expectations 2008 2012 end 2012 output economy still 3 2007 level indeed great recession
economy falling well short expectations monetary policy required shore defences prevent recession morphing depression meant interest rates falling unprecedentedly low levels uk globally indeed lowest levels bank englands history monetary medicine augmented 375 billion asset purchases bank 2009 onwards known colloquially quantitative easing qe
impossible know sure economy would performed without extraordinary monetary medicine banks estimates suggest may 6 smaller today money terms nation would billion poorer roughly gdp yorkshire humberside defensive measures go uk monetary policy past years positively
since start 2013 economy begun respond medicine uk output estimated grown 3 past year top league table among g7 nations growth year next forecast bank remain around 3 close top g7 league table output back precrisis levels
employment picture even positive 15 million jobs created less three years unemployment fallen peak 84 2011 66 today expected fall 6 2017 period inflationary pressures abated inflation falling peak 52 2011 15 today banks 2 inflation target banks forecasts suggest likely hover around target period ahead
turnaround economy prompted active debate banks monetary policy stance shifted back foot front words whether uk interest rates might rise market expectations future interest rates already adjusted since economy began growing january 2013 first rise uk interest rates expected third quarter 2015 expected end year
prospect sent shivers spines context important first rate rise come economy recovered sufficiently thrive smaller doses monetary medicine normalisation interest rates would signal economy returned hospital ward six years intensive care economy would switching channels er casualty something welcome fear
time banks policy guidance introduced august last year part prevent interest rate expectations getting ahead derailing recovery survey evidence appears businesses listened took heed investment rose 85 2013 meant uks recovery healthy reasonably balanced households companies contributing
none leaves job judging future path monetary policy easy one emerges severe setback since 1930s economy remains quote churchill 1930s riddle wrapped inside mystery inside let give examples
first riddle data economy riddled uncertainties beset revisions weeks ago awoke discover nation 65 billion better thought courtesy office national statistics alas excitement soon gave way mixed emotions windfall part fruits charitable drugs activities previously party must
set systematic revisions existing estimates national accounts data planned later year wellknown entirely understandable data subject revisions extent predictable bank even starts forecasting future economy begin past present
give current example although estimate first quarter gdp growth 08 bank expects final estimate 09 given strength business surveys 90 confidence interval around estimate 04 14 put differently 90 confident annual growth uk economy lies somewhere 54 raging boom 14 anaemic recovery hence riddle
second mystery productivity uk output per worker around 15 lower precrisis trend 4 lower peak 2007 fall greater recovery protracted postwar recession despite picking since 2013 productivity growth almost percentage point lower bank expected last august bank consistently productivity growth since 2007
termed productivity puzzle shortage candidate explanations temporary others durable include output labour hoarding slowing technological investment resource misallocation lender doubtless elements whether collectively fully account productivity gap questionable
resolution mystery important bearing economys future fortunes without pickup productivity rise demand economy risks bumping supply constraint sooner rather later would likely put upward pressure wages prices imperilling inflation target issuing policy guidance earlier year bank focussed measures slack economy clear without clear explanation earlier weakness difficult predict accuracy likely recovery hence mystery
third enigma never previously low inevitably uncertain economy respond interest rates begin rise various surveys sought shed light uk homeowners may fare example banks nmg survey 2012 found one percentage point rise interest rates could result almost half million households mortgage needing take corrective measures rises million households two percentage point rise
timely guide may come recent us experience middle last year longterm us interest rates rose around one percentage point expectation tapering us monetary policy socalled taper tantrum striking impact us housing market housing sales 7 lower year ago residential investment falling last quarters raises possibility borrowers reacting sharply rate rises past hence enigma
although touch depressing knowledge economy imperfect bank making renewed investment research data time hopefully help reduce uncertainties
back 1987 michael fish famously failed incoming storm caused havoc parts southern england finger blame pointed squarely uk meteorological office response met office made huge efforts improve data capture computing power basis improving weather forecasting results dramatic
past 30 years met offices forecasts improved significantly forecasts accurate forecasts 30 years ago improvements scale economic forecasters would give left arm unless like bowling arm suggests improved data pay real dividends
end bank investing improving data architecture analytics perhaps timely reading economic financial tea leaves found scraping web semantic search social media sites recent research suggested sorts question banks rocket scientists help us answer
uncertainties less acute comes modelling economy unlike rocket science economics physical constants fixed laws motion like cricket economics game largely played head nine parts psychology one part physics understanding modelling brain far eluded neuroscientists stopped economists boat bigger holes
even natural sciences dealing physical constants fixed laws motion voyage discovery sometimes lengthy one took century estimates speed light converged true value much period biased estimated confidence intervals around often encompass true modelling complex adaptive socioeconomic systems would make estimation problems pale significance
reasons bank also investing research capacity example quarterly inflation report bank shows alternative scenarios inflation output different assumptions world works alongside bank putting greater effort developing pluralist set approaches drawing disciplines
time investments data research narrow corridor uncertainty key public policy question operating real rather metaphorical kind clear answer question avoid really bad sometimes called minimax strategy aim minimise chances maximum possible loss policymakers equivalent hippocratic oath harm
scenarios let consider three potentially long list chosen probable outcomes precisely improbable contingencies would useful safeguard consistent hippocratic oath
one adverse scenario economy could stall recovery deflationary forces could set monetary policy could trapped protracted period zero lower bound much secular stagnation secular deflation look hard find realworld examples
widely studied course japanese experience since bursting bubble early 1990s quartercentury since nominal gdp japan barely budged real gdp growth japan averaged 07 per year since 1997 offset persistent fall prices average 1 per year similar deflationary concerns albeit lesser scale voiced recently euroarea
great risks uk today least ear mood music different trough real gdp uk risen 7 nominal gdp 19 uk real gdp risen trend past four quarters expected continue next 12 quarters japan equivalent period sustained growth precrisis rate past 25 years
deflationary threats one guide found market measures mediumterm inflation expectations 35 year horizon consensus inflation expectations japan averaged around 1 past 15 years euroarea inflation expectations recently fallen around 18 deflationary fears uk meanwhile inflation expectations remained relatively stable around 2 target throughout crisis period financial markets least appear fearful deflationary ghosts uk
second uncomfortable scenario flipside first would inflationary pressures instead took hold important dismiss risk hand monetary policy unknown territory extraordinary dose monetary medicine perhaps administered patient whistling way around hospital ward overreaction drugs cannot ruled
already signs economys pulse quickening confidence fairy back six years rehab levels consumer confidence 2007 levels retail spending rising rapid rate since 2004 levels job security highest since least 1990s feelgood factor adding momentum uk housing market
businesses rediscovered mojo surveys output intentions close record highs quarterly employment growth running fastest rate since series began surveys skills shortages point possibility upwards localised wage pressures output growth 2014 q1 nearly 1 higher unemployment rate close 1 percentage point lower bank expected last august history guide errors tend positively correlated upside well
yet time inflationary risks posed scenario overstated output unemployment surprised upside 1 average wages inflation surprised amount downside real wage growth positive six months past six years inflation expectations remain well anchored inflation target inflationary ghosts hard find
third uncertainty concerns financial side economy global appetite risk present voracious measures financial market uncertainty precrisis levels across range asset classes many asset prices rocketed spreads plummeted two years ago yields italian spanish debt around five percentage points us treasuries today 3040 basis points yields corporate bonds high low grade close alltime lows
short search yield broadened deepened one sense precrisis low volatility justified high prices high prices low volatility constellation asset prices appeared consistent larry summers famously commented finance theory tells us price two bottles ketchup assuming know price one precrisis second bottle ketchup looked relative first
even asset prices consistent among need imply consistent reality precrisis price risk became far cheap relative fundamentals first bottle ketchup woefully overpriced finance theory ensured second bottle similarly marked way seeds crisis sown
risk cognitive dissonance rising low volatilities used justify high valuations viceversa ketchup bottle looks fairly valued relative sauces price ketchup relative fundamentals price risk becoming low price safety time cheap clear answers know serious questions
one sense rising risktaking evidence monetary medicine working adverse sideeffects alternative drug called upon macroprudential policies important new addition central bank armoury risks localised say uk housing market macroprudential measures act like targeted lightning strike banks financial policy committee fpc discussing risks tonight steal lightning
risktaking becomes broadlybased broadlybased response may stage appropriate rumble thunder rather strike lightning case stronger greater chances asymmetric asset price response sharp snapback volatility asset prices could imperil mpcs guidance gives monetary policy role last line defence macroprudential actions cannot contain risks evolve mpc fpc need assess risks carefully
faced uncertainties would prudent course monetary policy period ahead first thing say consensus across mpc three key elements monetary strategy rate rise need immediate rate rises come intended gradual interest rates mediumterm likely somewhat lower historical average
message appears largely understood financial markets despite upwards revision growth financial markets best guess rapidly first percentage point tightening take place essentially unchanged past year around 20 basis points per quarter best guess interest rates may settle medium run around 23
views may time differ across mpc preferred liftoff date interest rates would expect turning point cycle reflect individual members different reading runes individual preferences real benefit mpcs committeebased structure individual member accountability
difficult see choice timing difficult one policymaker situation faces dilemma batsmen facing ball pitching corridor uncertainty situation coaching manual longer offers clear guide two strategies equally justifiable
first stay back foot play late advantage giving batsmen time get read trajectory ball swings darts around avoids risk lurching forward needing hurriedly reverse course first movement misjudged way joe root yorkshire england batsmen plays cricket mpc hed called dove
strategy playing late relies uncannily good eye strong nerve runs risk react fast furiously avoid missing ball entirely earlier front foot movement would avoid risk allowing gradual movement forward way ian bell warwickshire england batsman plays cricket mpc hed called hawk
better strategy benjamin disraeli told us lies damned lies statistics analogy cricket economy breaks economic statistics know sometimes lie cricket statistics typically tell us joe root averages 43 test matches ian bells 45 words close run thing odds present slightly favouring front foot good run scores either player could easily tilt balance nutshell mpc finds today
