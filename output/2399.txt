deadline sign kind medical bill payment program still two weeks away already obvious anyone paying attention affordable care act ª inaccurate euphemism obamacare often known ª complete failure never enacted
republican partys steadfast opposition led obamacares demise though turns republicans didnt trouble attempts repeal obama administrations politically ideologically motivated actions emasculated democrats purported health care reform law
almost soon democrats passed bill could find obama administration began grant waiver waiver various groups organizations usually coincidentally elements democratic partys coalition
came disastrous rollout federal governments obamacare website
came wave insurance policy cancellations leading revelation obama repeatedly said like doctor keep doctor like health care plan keep health care plan knowingly deliberately lying sure shouldnt revelation anyone paying attention anyone wise ways politicians people dont pay attention arent wise politicians ways may think
followed another waiver ª one potentially could gut law cases people would allowed ask insurance providers old superior policies back even though old policies dont comply obamacares requirements
among waivers granted obama administration employer mandate provide staff least basic coverage face fine delayed whose plans canceled temporarily exempt individual mandate purchase health insurance
initially exemption would expired september year white house let happen right midterm elections expected help republicans pick senate seats perhaps win back control congress
early month came another waiver really big one ª big wasnt even announced
people allowed renew noncompliant policies 2016 time president preparing leave white house longer worry political consequences rotten law millions americans allowed avoid paying individual mandate penalty claiming cancellation policies constitutes hardship
news serious revision obamacare law finally got last week health human services secretary kathleen sebelius initially testified house ways means committee wednesday reports accurate concede reports accurate least shows honorable honest senate majority leader harry reid still retracted claim insurance cancellation horror stories press reporting fake
makes latest obamacare waiver big deal obamacare simply doesnt work without individual mandate ª unless nearly everyone forced either buy extremely expensive health insurance sign welfare entire system breaks pay high medical costs highrisk preexisting conditions pay free contraceptive drugs procedures insurance companies need everyone buy health plans start exempting millions americans otherwise would comply new law falls apart
thus find watching insane president effectively repealing delaying individual mandate threatening veto bill delays individual mandate
heres want know powers never real intention enacting enforcing law bother unwilling populace first place could saved us employers insurance providers lot trouble
unless lot trouble whole point along
