frank exchange views good conversation reached shareholder ive met large shareholders ª
recently
ª want dialogue want listen thoughts ideas feedback carl others
agreed ground rules agreed would record allowed open conversation good mutually respectful dialogue thats different stuff going media intelligent informed mutual discussion
agreement criticize publicly
laughs ill say carl said going different points view irony share view driving shareholder value matter different perspective timeframe matters get
youre obviously longterm focused much say think shortterm traders valuable voice compared longterm shareholders
get longterm thousand never create longterm value ignore short term youve got pay attention short term whether every quarter thats true customers thats true innovation thats true execution thats true shareholder value doesnt mean whether issue shortterm tradeoffs hurt long term thats dont want want shortterm intelligent decisions help short term long term
sometimes make decision short term may materialize immediately
bet hard mobile took betting right russia brazil india emerging markets betting local onlinetooffline efforts something like ebay paypal offline making bets short term dont payback long term think would willing make shortterm decisions hurt long term
like youre allowed sit focus long term put head sand feel pressure board management team every day
sum think carl raise attention temporarily share value pop drive share value move
think evidence speaks look track record
weve spent lot time talking carl spinoffs havent talked acquisitions lets talk
obviously want make acquisitions help ebay longterm beyond expand elaborate
one best recent examples braintree thought braintree enormous strategic value paypal vice versa paypal could help braintree expand paid expensive premium
braintree dilute ebays value 3 cents share 3 cents diluted driving paypals margin one reasons paypals margin going invested lot money braintree ª 800 million buy ª invested money think going drive greater growth braintrees customers customers thirdparty developers theyre future
look companies braintrees customers sharing economy companies uber airbnb theyre driving social theyre really innovative platform really simple easy use combine paypal sdk braintree sdk think incredible marketleading product thats executing going hurt margins short term going drive growth term important strategic sustainable growth
youve made 37 acquisitions one controversial ones happened september 2008 bought billmelater 800 million financial crisis
month lehman brothers went bought credit business widely criticized drove margins paypal two years integrated ebay integrated portfolio billmelater growing significantly strategic value beyond financial values continue make acquisitions effect
think experience icahn impact ª even subconsciously ª entrepreneurs deciding whether take companies public opposed getting acquired
hadnt thought may make people think want investors want build long term want longtermoriented investors longtermoriented investors care short term say make intelligent tradeoffs along way think company cares want investors
previously first letter shareholders came guys quieter regards speaking clearly changed myriad number ways change

carl like say financially engineered shortterm sighted
hell drive get wont responsibility best way drive value sustainable shareholder value focusing customers innovation execution growth stronger better together thats fundamental belief
someone recently said 21st century equivalent gold rush gold data theres much value sounds lot like youre saying
current synergies lot data traded ebay paypal

youve heard tell everyone next years isnt going easier last know youve heard say right best way drive real sustainable shareholder value
goal 50 share value 100 depending time frame people releasing plans blah blah blah blah blah cant committed timeline leveraging 120 million customers 25 million active sellers environment theres convergence
everyones like spin paypal everyone wants paypal paypal everyone wants believe best way grow paypal part challenge part spending time getting message clearly
zerosum game think amazon winner google winner ebay winner dont think zerosum game doesnt lend superficial sound bytes fundamental direction fundamental opportunity going
dont like naming companies dont like compared particular one lets say amazon theres one thing two common perhaps misconceptions misunderstandings prioritizing long term short term years amazon misunderstood regarding amazon web services
yes yes yes imagine giving away free operating system going 1 billion service revenue model reid said ill call longterm orientation vs shortterm believe long term doesnt mean dont look shareholder value belief best way getting shareholder value ª internet digital world ª regarding ongoing innovation continuous execution theres substitute dont get right dont drive shareholder value drives enormous shareholder value sector sector mature industry
significant number ebay shareholders would agree
think many shareholders understand synergy think longterm shareholders believe paypal ebay together drive greater growth thus greater shareholder value time theyre looking us continue innovate execute thats want 100 focus messy distraction separation shortterm things may look compelling short term maybe create pop dont think create sustainable value theyre moving chess pieces around chessboard
