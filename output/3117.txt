supposedly began hunting gathering dominates 90 modern human history epoch humans considered jackofalltrades learning necessary skills survival arguably image earliest supposed form trading comes mind cave man trying initiate trade giving away rabbit fur exchange really wants boar meat today exchange practice called barter system wellaccepted earliest form transaction
say wellaccepted anthropologist david graeber argues earliest supposed predecessor money bartering didnt actually exist money even barter system exist wouldnt practical sustainable daily practice like exchange money imagine hard would one wanted anything offer ª wouldnt last long bartering item dead mammoth ª would drag around trade berries
around end pleistocene epoch commonly referred recent ice age ended around 1000 years ago domestication wheat grains animals emerged humans spread across globe domestication led emergence farming centralized increased population density centralized population density longer necessary jackofalltrades hunting gathering lifestyle demanded instead individuals began start focusing specialization
farmed others tailored pretty soon became accountants barter system would sustain civilization individuals one specialty offer clothing trader could offer farmer clothes wheat farmer doesnt need new clothes every day like clothing trader needs food get food barter system tailor would get pretty creative exchanging one thing another seeing bread would become game try win bread literally
demand controlled transaction system paved way emergence money used measurement value money accounting transacting money exchange emergence money didnt start paper coins know love today cowry shells one first popular forms money used conduct trade around africa asia fact shells used currency africa uganda specifically 19th century
prehistoric banks emerged civilizations like mesopotamia people could deposit valuables safekeeping trading new system came necessity record history transactions coming going also resulted first known use ledger recording transaction history
emergence money wasnt concerted effort initiated global agreement stemmed mesopotamia like today different forms currency cowry shells universal banknote grains cloth items also used money sound different three major features common
physical ideas cant money sure make money cant money
resilient tangible isnt enough civilization transacting leaves might left bankrupt strong wind better yet try put 50 leaves pocket
community agree without consensus stability currency undermined individuals arent sure people want transact even accept money
first two features could easily found items like shells grains cloth third little trickier without sort overseeing entity enforced acceptance stability currency could guaranteed around 600 bc last problem solved emergence coin
problem using grains ª go farm grains shells go beach could currency system truly trustworthy anyone go make currency time one big issues coins tackled
lydians ancient greece first known group people start using coins 500 years later larger cities like athens started catch unlike shells grains citizens couldnt go find gold silver melt shape coins intricate stamps even todays world thats still quite specialized task despite abundance tools disposal
coin came literal stamp approval coin rulers printed faces national symbols guarantee civilizations commanded would guarantee worth coin ie long civilization existed currency would still worth something shift using coins made circulation controllable rulers currency trusted citizens
invention coins solved many problems money still disadvantages one coins molded precious metals including gold circulation supply growth limited availability precious metals furthermore took space heavy made storing carrying inconvenient inconvenience lack supply became growing problem emergence paper
100 bc chinese invented first form paper long first use case emerged rather carrying coins everywhere people could leave valuables bank bank would provide signed note verified value items person bank ie first banknote system based trust note could exchanged actual valuables instead exchanging tangible valuables time people could continue exchange notes
invasion china mongol empire picked practice paper currency well 13th century marco polo brought paper money back europe 17th century europe caught trend goldsmiths adopted practice using notes security backed goldsmiths gold
people using holding paper note rather exchanging everything backed valuables european banks started issue notes could backed betting hypothesis every individual holding notes would come knocking door next day asking gold became first practice expansion money supply would consider modern money
move away gold
todays money redeemable gold silver wasnt case 1930s prior every dollar printed backed 040 worth gold europeans believed entire population wouldnt withdraw us gave leniency amount available gold supply exchange dollars
early 1930s good financial time united states great depression struck 1929 stock market crash
effort reinvigorate us economy franklin roosevelt president time decided print money effort initiate spending program unfortunately limited supply gold hands tied ª couldnt increase taxes economic tragedy couldnt print money wasnt enough gold great depression turned individuals gold hoarders fear rush banks would collapse entire economy banks 040 gold per dollar couldnt possibly pay everyone
1933 president roosevelt made private ownership gold illegal prevent gold withdrawn banks closed doors three days made illegal citizen privately gold ª became crime heavy sentence 10 years prison citizens instructed turn gold back federal reserve federal reserve would issue paper money
despite arguably authoritarian move plan failed curb great depression lasted another six years damage done 1971 president richard nixon officially moved us dollar away gold backing wasnt 1977 private ownership gold legalized ironically president ford one repealed gold prohibition set forth president roosevelt didnt even know owning gold illegal
weve reached fairly modernday monetary practices weve seen started arguably barter system transform currency system based value items grains shells cloth value guaranteed established government minting coins coins became burden paper replaced
majority transactions handled primarily paper governments became lenient ratio precious metals available long paper currency became completely dissociated precious metals currency derived value instead paper currency became purely promise government worth something
today even paper currency arguably true currency anymore sapiens 2011 anthropologist yuval noah harari states
words 90 perhaps even higher statistic published 2011 entire globes currency fact digital currency
2009 unknown person group pseudonym satoshi nakamoto introduced paper within document contained idea decentralized trustless peertopeer system currency called bitcoin things define
decentralized central authority participants economy preserve existence economy
trustless approach guaranteeing accuracy integrity without need trust traditional centralized systems community relies trust eg trust bank lose money
peertopeer transaction approach cuts middleman exchange conducted directly parties
document proposed using system adam backs actually invented back 1997 didnt understand meant basically means satoshi nakamoto repurposed adam backs system make bitcoin work
major value proposition bitcoin worlds first digital currency mentioned 90 worlds current existing money already digital exists digital united states backed 1 040 worth gold today similar situation exists one physical dollar exists every nine digital dollars concept digital currency already use today swipe debit credit card
major value proposition bitcoin blockchain many decentralized cryptocurrencies manage digital currency experience decentralized trustless direct peertopeer transacting importance often lost frenzy price hype peak beneath hood though see potential next shift currency movement away circulation control government
new money system facilitate global growth
connected feel today services internet reality much world still isolated globalization little romantic vision point available enough us believe taken granted much phones battery life 39 worlds population almost 3 billion people access banks thats almost every person existence blessed part privileged half
interconnectivity world globalization human interaction applies pressure need trusted currency global scale try move large amounts money across borders feel friction depending country youre youll realize expensive slow despite fact 90 currency digital process transferring still inefficient creates inconvenient barriers inhibit growth global system
evolution money transacting throughout human existence historically trended towards optimization barter systems arguably became currencies standardize value facilitate easier exchange shell currencies replaced minted coins molded precious materials control supply provide better guarantee value coin transactions shifted bank notes backed precious materials convenience recently bank notes dissociated valuable materials backed governments easier control money supply inflation nowadays bank notes used less less currency becoming digital
borders still exist political level beginning break social one human effort connect extends beyond political corporate relationships struggle drive existing monetary system circulated corporate political institutions inflection point users must decide continue trusting abandon latter requires alternative solution transition next system money
bitcoin may answer
blockchain methodology provided bitcoin one alternative solution designed decentralized bitcoin essentially distributes copy every piece transaction history anyone wants one people participate checking historical future transactions longer single entity deciding factor validity supply transaction history entire community furthermore participating bitcoin makes impervious exploitation ª larger community secure bitcoins blockchain malicious intentions like hacks
first cryptocurrency bitcoin reputation earlystage value also set stage decentralized currency look like proved concept fact work within decade became global experiment
said bitcoin may answer satoshi nakamotos original vision bitcoin ordinary citizens participate process rewarded bitcoins using little internetconnected computer users realized powerful processors advantage faster updating transactions little technical bitcoin uses hashing algorithm parallelized processors speed hashing process would result rewards nowadays expensive specialized computers called applicationspecific integrated circuits asics chance earning bitcoin rewards
downside hashing advantage though isnt ordinary citizens cant participate rather consumes lot energy according maintaining bitcoin blockchain current consumes amount energy per year country algeria estimated costs currently little 3 billion carbon footprint single bitcoin transaction equal carbon footprint visa card transactions
reality bitcoin blockchain need consume much energy designed race update transactions always result winner approximately every 10 minutes whether one computer million computers energy consumption largely driven competition profit ie greed bitcoin blockchain solve issue stronger candidate global adoption
separate common flawed argument critics reference question legitimacy bitcoin money used illicit activities illegal activities existed long bitcoin continue exist regardless bitcoins fate tools instrument progress destruction different hands bitcoin transacting suspicious buying drugs internet cash transactions suspicious buying guns craigslist saying goes theres theres way
emergence value
despite longer backed gold us dollar still worth 1 united states governments existence backs us dollar argument made existence essentially every currency today ª governmentbacked
ultimately though argument value existing due government consensus promise argument collective imagination acceptance ª said equally important government backing nation many cases today global agreement currency worth something therefore transact
latter exists cryptocurrency world governing body value guarantee worth cryptocurrency therefore cryptocurrency historically struggled find acceptable identity currency value beyond speculation late 2015 started changing rapid emergence initial coin offerings icos ethereum
ico fundraising event early adopters new coin get believe would special price buying early stages project using existing cryptocurrency like ethereum example wanted create coin called foodiecoin launch ico tell people vision importance foodiecoin set early buyin price 500 1 ethereum investors interested see potential value buy currently icos walk fine line cant done regulation intend participating tread caution ª im lawyer accountant misconstrued legal investment advice im simply providing definition example ico
today browse youll see 3300 different cryptocurrencies majority exist ethereum token born icos many arguably labeled coin actual value created pure financial gain creators new interesting projects emerging purely cryptocurrency space marketplaces similar ebay rideshare platforms similar uber new economy constructed used transacting cryptocurrency infancy many ideas likely fail majority ideas entirely original rather transference existing ideas existing realm technology ported cryptocurrency economy
type transformation layers foundation innovation moving forward seen many times economic transformations nations recent example china adopting opendoor policy 1978 enabled easily trade nations china became worlds industrial empire economy grew nation started become technologically savvy initially innovation copying business models existing technology companies rest world essentially begun process transferring existing technologies ideas nation fastforward today chinas technology innovation prowess countries trying replicate unusual see feature facebook similar chinese app years cryptocurrency innovation may soon become privy fate
next steps
cryptocurrency barely regulated space exists collective user consensus value whether future bitcoin existing cryptocurrency one thats yet created reality turbulent path crypto market right track potentially huge transformation innovation global scale
economically money evolved thousands years trading shells rectangular plastic suit needs time population todays time involves national population global one result eventual replacement current money system pressure statement isnt promise bitcoin hopefuls threat existing institutions observation glimpse evolution money
