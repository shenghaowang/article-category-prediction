theres lot talk exploiting us energy boom undermine putin russia boom may profound effects long run nothing done materially harm putin punish crimea subsequent aggressive moves may make
yes us restrictions exports natural gas crude oil economically idiotic even absent geopolitical considerations even bans eliminated tomorrow huge given sits white key largo case may europes energy situation would change one whit
would possible start moving large quantities crude export ban lifted would largely offset decline us exports refined products major effect ban distort crude refined total supply crude refined products especially short run major effect ban present benefit us refiners refine crude selling world prices ban export products one study estimates eliminating ban would drop world oil prices cents dollars
respect natural gas situation even less favorable even doe granted pending lng export licenses years product start flowing cheniere received first license may 2011 facility come line late2015 earliest company head start converting existing facility built import lng facilities take longer build starting scratch
long run impact eliminating export ban depends elasticity supply gas us elastic current price levels yes ban lifted world prices fall substantially russia hit hard supply less elastic impact far smaller elasticity supply depend crucially technological factors including suitability new formations fracking horizontal drilling depletion rates wells rate technological innovation factors quite uncertain experience past decade says anything says leery making predictions natural gas supply
brief us energy export policy stupid fixing appreciable impact russia years
similarly fixing stupid european policies energy eg fracking bans massive renewables subsidies like done reasons independent geopolitics even done tomorrow material impact european energy prices russian energy revenues years come
main way impose substantial costs russia today via energy would impose trade sanctions given fact oil market essentially global scope coordinating global boycott russian oil would virtually impossible natural gas feasible target europe could boycott russian gas unilaterally effective way russia sell gas asia anywhere else
substantial asymmetry russia depends heavily gas exports approximately 25 percent russian governments revenue comes gazprom knock effect russian economy would likely huge severe fiscal constraints would likely put substantial strains russian banking system
yes europe would hurt higher prices lower consumption gas gas comprises far lower percentage european expenditures russian income meaning hit europe would far smaller moreover impact could mitigated substantially increasing coal imports increased norwegian production diversion lng asia europe especially uk excess lng import capacity could use lng displace north sea gas could pipe europe moreover winter ending cost supply interruption spring summer would far less cost winter
doubt going happen another asymmetry asymmetry political old europe stomach confrontation putin crimea ukraine much anything else yes donald claim vouch based family old europe vs new europe formulation capture essential truth especially russia involved lack means old especially unwilling pay price punish putin talk free thats willing pay
dont think moment putin hasnt based plans exactly calculation
attempt scare attempt sanctions russia threatened retaliation lavrov told kerry moves boomerang russian officials said russia insulate west thereby making immune sanctions
retaliation threatened includes expropriation assets western companies quite predictable russian reaction typically expropriation would cement russias reputation lawless country foreign investors rush angels fear tread russian equity valuations would crater direct investment would capital flight would accelerate costs inflicted russia would dwarf inflicted us europe would last years
great plan another major asymmetry russian retaliation would harm russia far europe us boomerang
reminds old joke grants muzhik one wish one condition anything muzhik wishes gets neighbor gets double muzhik thinks minute says wish one eyes
said think economic sanctions form boycotting russian energy exports cutting imports eg drilling equipment effective least costly way imposing costs putin elite depends said since georgia 2008 best way attack putin elite go money west policy getting widespread publicity lay claim early advocate
measure targeted make decisions rather russia russians generally could used putin claim west waging war russia indeed could undermine political support among elite would paying price among broader population already disgusted corruption would unlikely sympathy corruption exposed illgotten gains seized cost western economies would small indeed would represent victory rule law
would impose costs connected people west moreover precisely would strike deeply putin would cause lose fear causes euros shrink away terror
something us pursue unilaterally yes given dirty russian money europe caribbean measures would much effective europeans participated us still wield considerable power note forced switzerland heel tax something agree pointing us leverage indeed mere threat exposing could make europeans think twice
lack hope drives policy concede crimea putin stop
sum powerful policy tool disposal far better tool available circumstances tools sanctions costly yet supposed us energy
serious well use doubts serious europe lesser degree us demonstrated anything recent years past masters kicking crimea ukraine putin likely another
