proved true shows remote sensing satellites play important role locating wreckage crashed plane done within couple hours accident multiple highresolution satellites used
remote sensing satellites broadly classified two categories c optical radar satellites
optical satellites deliver unclassified images resolution half metre radar satellites provide unclassified images one metre resolution
metallic structures plane wreckage produce strong return radar images making easily visible satellite imaging radar also see cloud take images day night
according chinas satellite images c taken suspected crash area day flight mh370 went missing saturday c largest object shown 24m 22m clearly large enough optical radar satellites
noted images object closely surrounded cloud potential wreckage would spotted optical satellite covered cloud would still visible radar image
thats makes sense use optical radar satellites search location plane wreckage
search much slower sea level indonesian search rescue members looking missing flight mh370 malacca straits near aceh sea credit epa eye sky
satellite remote sensing many advantages conventional air sea search using ships aircraft
satellites orbit around earth height cover large area typically 100km 100km 10000 square kilometres c size cuba even 500km 500km 25000 square kilometres c size uk single image collected seconds
would take aircraft 15 34 hours cover area ship take much longer
much cost effective use remote sensing satellites search large areas
another advantage satellites orbit cameras radar sensors board always standby switched immediately soon space agencies informed accident pointed straight area around last known coordinates aircraft
also makes much quicker respond incidents air crash air sea search vessels
another advantage satellites take images globally without issue around border protection much easier use international search
although remote sensing satellites potential global coverage difficulty imaging two poles thats use capability c mostly look
aircraft goes missing mountains also good chance wreckage may hidden forest canopy although long radars penetrate tree canopy may still difficulty seeing dense tropical forest
contrast open sea favourable environment searching missing aircraft satellite remote sensing main features satellite image sea water plane wreckage c less chance confusing wreckage targets trucks trains farm houses case plane crash land
since 2008 earth observing systems group school civil environmental engineering responded near realtime range natural disasters using optical radar satellite remote sensing
events include major earthquakes china new zealand victoria floods queensland new south wales victoria
team repeatedly demonstrated intelligence ground deformation fire flood extent extracted delivered relevant authorities within two hours satellite image capture
