two key events allow chance review situation fracking britain ask basic questions including oil gas industry driving
1964 tory government sir alec douglashome began license areas uk north sea oil gas exploration initially interest oil industry halfhearted gas discovered west sole september 1965 pace picked oil found forties field october 1970 gold rush uk sector north sea became alongside norwegian sector site speculation place money could made capital could invested profit generated uk north sea became profit centre western oil corporations remains today make possible new infrastructure created
order oil extracted 1100 feet beneath seabed transported hundreds miles pipeline case forties field physical infrastructure built order happen financial infrastructure constructed government financing everything ports airsea rescue teams worlds lowest oil taxes topped tax breaks grants myriad manufacturing processes order oil rigs treasury rules become common sense political infrastructure necessary active support north sea oil came every corner house commons engine whitehall put work finally infrastructure culture sense general population uk developing north sea oil good thing resource would miraculously save britain economic ruin 1970s searching evidence british civil society opposition exploiting oil gas opening decades 1980s appears none
intention fracking companies presently work across england europa union jack oil surrey cuadrilla lancaster uk oil gas sussex ineos south yorkshire fields woods villages hills become sites speculation companies interested one thing making money carbon cash
pr departments companies spout line fracking make uk secure energy uks energy security becomes evermore important brexit unreliability russia source gas point fracking revolution us apparently reversed inevitable decline american oil gas production altered geopolitical map world despite national politicians mouthing rhetoric idea fracking could done us blatant nonsense nonsensical argument gas fracking help uk address climate change
fracking uk keeping lights saving planet rather energy insecurity environment used oil companies help create political financial conditions make possible remake uk onshore site speculation
something different way uk north sea exploited 1960s 1970s way industry trying exploit onshore britain 200s 2010s fifty years ago charge offshore drilling led massive corporations c bp shell esso todays exxonmobil rtz texaco smaller us companies hamilton oil occidental today big companies nowhere seen uk
famously bob dudley ceo bp said 2014 asked company pursuing fracking britain think would attract wrong kind attention however promote industry saying look like shale uk would seem right country see whether shale gas meanwhile bp gets ever deeper fracking oil gas around world argentina oman canada china russia divest fracking report elaborates
important remember bp finds profitable pursue fracking gas oman shell similarly argentina countries booming markets gas consumption gas exploited lands largely domestic use export lng ships traverse oceans bear testament international market gas theory gas uk gas oman argentina would perfectly possible compete global market products
possible bob dudley say bp drilling would attract wrong kind attention course hes trying avoid adverse publicity bp really wanted frack uk would set determinedly trying despite bad press dudley doesnt want bp frack britain cost production still much higher uk elsewhere opposition fracking fact industry failed build infrastructure speculation c physical political financial cultural infrastructure 1960s 70s construction infrastructure proving far harder resistance strong
divest fracking explains uk public support fracking low 18 population say stands stark contrast publics support renewables strong 85 scottish government consultation fracking last year attracted 6500 responses 99 respondents opposed fracking cultural infrastructure necessary fracking work easily constructed britain
oil industry privately admits carrying fracking revolution uk equivalent us likely impossible geology unfavourable rather human geography challenging many say small crowded country texas north dakota fracking us depended upon ability drillers rapidly move rigs support facilities simply network roads vast blocks single landholding uk tight country lanes patchwork myriad landowners combined lack support wider culture fracking process constantly obstructed history leith hill shows
political support unequivocally behind fracking uk government supports whitehall machine assists although decision gove defra could indicate change tack sections tory party however scottish government instituted moratorium similar halts place wales northern ireland green party liberal democrats labour largely opposed best ambivalent case national level far local level battle leith hill powerfully assisted liberal democrat local councillor hazel watson dorking hills ward surrey county council
financial infrastructure fracking complex much money behind likes europa ineos cuadrilla private equity funds see fracking highrisk investment good chance companies projects fold possibility high returns succeed however security private investors decreased institutional investors go cold fracking part importance campaign make local authorities divest pension funds companies conduct fracking
campaign took major step forward release divest fracking report powerful media response covered bp shell may fracking uk local authorities divest shares companies fracking sends powerful signal capital markets risk investing uk fracking grows higher opposition grows divestment also undermines political support fracking
