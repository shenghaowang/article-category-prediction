gops health law alternative could messy obamacare
ever since republicans began using words repeal replace back 2010 describe intentions affordable care act theyve faced question exactly would replace
theres currently clear republican alternative health care law president obamas signature domestic achievement house republican leadership signaling one year
signal came form interview washington posts robert costa house majority whip rep kevin mccarthy official house gops leadership
goal give voters clear way distinguish republican democratic approaches part gop plan democrats controversial health care law every opportunity midterm election year
apparently isnt yet detailed alternative analyze concepts considered part proposed replacement far new indeed theyve part republican alternatives conservative think tanks like american enterprise institute heritage foundation
final gop package could include old like health savings accounts expanding staterun highrisk pools individuals sale insurance across state lines
one immediate problem republicans ideas dont exactly insurance industry like say individual mandate without backing would hard pull
indeed insurance industry might expected fiercely lobby ample war chest gop proposals
every insurance industry executive talk thinks proposals silly said robert laszewski health care industry expert interview politics blog post laszewski explains industry officials objections gop proposals selling insurance across state lines
another problem republican proposals could undermine two health care laws popular features ª ban insurance companies declining insure people preexisting conditions charging amounts ability parents keep children age 26 insurance plans
said laszewski raised problem aca banned preexisting conditions reason insuring someone need staterun highrisk pools people preexisting conditions formerly would turn
return highrisk pools would definition mean time insurance companies used preexisting conditions exclude certain people
cant imagine republican candidate wanting go november election suggesting go back preexisting conditions laszewski said
laszewski fan affordable care act fashioned also skeptical republican approach hes seen far
ive critical obama people built obamacare never really consulted people industry thats one big reasons got mess laszewski said go republicans instead something think tank republicans rightwing think tank
