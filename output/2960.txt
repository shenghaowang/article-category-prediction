russian energy divided transatlantic alliance 60 years tensions normally simmer flare new project proposed especially political crisis 1960s prospect increased soviet oil exports following cuban missile crisis 1980s soviet gas western europe soviet union invaded afghanistan martial law declared poland today proposed nord stream 2 gas pipeline russias annexation crimea war ukraine among actions
disagreements natural broad alliance diverse interests perspectives almost impossible discuss russian gas sense calm increasingly true things related russia russian initiatives infused perceptions fears range simple legitimate obscure farfetched reality arguments russian gas rarely russian gas history strategy geopolitics gas spark end result confusion discord time transatlantic alliance enough needing add gas fire
time separate russian gas broader russia agenda boost energy security protect strengthen transatlantic alliance allow us focus west resist russian power meaningfully argument rests three propositions first energy give russia much power usually assume second antagonistic strategy unlikely sustained succeed bringing change whether energy geopolitics third best response russian gas set policies europe pursue anyway unrelated russia short need radically rethink russian gas much matters united states europe
russia often referred energy superpower term catchy also vague mean link energy russian power power real merely perceived power easy wield ephemeral durable vary instance according price oil countrys reliance russia usually meaning russian gas might country try curtail power conditions might power diminished neutralized answer questions must begin one energy connected power
first russian economy fueled hydrocarbons since 1998 economy doubled hard imagine happening without 36 trillion russia earned exporting oil gas growth strong oil gas prices high prices 1998 2009 2014 economy either stagnated recession government relied oil gas quarter revenues1 used hydrocarbons reduce public debt 56 percent gross domestic product 200 7 percent 2008 17 percent 2017 country also run steady current account surpluses since 1997 accumulated international reserves almost 600 billion mid2008 448 billion yearend 2017 hydrocarbons power russian economy hence russias political geopolitical ambitions
second energy primary interface russias relations countries oil gas countrys main exported goods accounting 60 percent total european countries trade russia means largely trade oil gas even russian imports european companies lobby governments support least insulate political conflict paid oil gas exports investment russian companies refineries pipelines storage facilities assets across many european countries since russias largest oil gas companies majority owned state investments inevitable political overtones
third energy strategic commodity means countries attach energy importance attach goods russia major oil gas producer exporter strategy activities attract widespread interest reliance russian hydrocarbons especially gas politically sensitive 60 years countries imported russian oil gas wondered russia cut supplies make political point widespread assumption countries would assertive toward russia absent fear
60 years west tried almost every approach toward soviet russian hydrocarbons april 1959 united kingdom banned soviet oil imports although archival research shows policy far unanimously endorsed reflected wishes domestic industrial interests rather grand strategy foreign policy yet time italy west germany selling equipment soviet union italy particular importing increasing quantities soviet consternation across atlantic
november 1962 united states led north atlantic treaty organization nato impose embargo large diameter pipeline exports soviet union goal delay even stop druzhba pipeline would increase soviet oil exports embargo split alliance united kingdom vocal pipeline completed slight delay embargo removed 1966 angela stent put one could argue pipe embargo caused damage useuropean relations soviet assessment applies almost every overt transatlantic effort soviet later russian hydrocarbons
dtente years 1970s energy important eastwest trade driven part western economic growth lifted energy demand slowdown soviet economy led soviet leaders seek import western technology overcome innovation gap confronting western industry seeking outlet goods sense trade might improve political relations trade boomed impact politics unclear stent concluded seminal work west german ostpolitik general illusory believe west significantly change soviet political behavior use economic lesson seems apply broadly
early 1980s policy shifted back confrontation december 1981 united states imposed embargo equipment exports soviet union order slow prevent construction another gas pipeline would increase soviet exports western europe unlike 1962 united states found cold reception across western europe also clear willingness resist embargo lifted less year later one results stimulate soviet industry toward greater selfsufficiency pipeline eventually built minor delays
1990s western firms invested oil gas russia although role shrank state reasserted prominence incorporation eastern european countries western alliance diluted already shaky cohesion toward russia consensus became even harder reach focus slowly shifted toward either search alternative supply sources via pipeline liquefied natural gas lng explicit efforts block individual projects nord stream south stream yamal lng nord stream last one causing turmoil days
conclude history broad terms might make two observations first amount political pressure succeeded altering curtailing nearly irresistible urge trade russia vast oil gas resources europe needs energy russia deliver energy competitive price alternative would either costly europe less profitable russia trade occur occurred almost irrespective politics 60 years everything else auxiliary fundamental reality
second united states europe different takes merits economic coercion versus cooperation united states often pushing sanctions much europe prefers contact grand strategy certainly shaped parochial interests course united states keen limit soviet energy exports europe happily sold grain soviet union grain soviet union shortlived muted global trading system ensured us food exports hit europe faced similar industrial pressures either pushing closer ties sounding alarm barely concealing narrow business interests seems broader philosophical divide recurs difficult bridge
grander lesson history might radical still energy central character broader story bilateral relationship many observers tend think energy shapes far actually shapes energy major source economic collaboration russia west leads policymakers turn energy fight political battles tendency connect energy geopolitics recurrent undercurrent discussions countries clash gas often clashing different conceptions energy politics connected
hard list questions assumptions consciously subconsciously shape policy sample policymakers agreed questions would likely agree policy energy exports soviet times prop soviet economy give soviets leverage either toward west toward socialist countries trade bring real change soviet european behavior fall oil prices 1980s make material contribution fall soviet union rebound oil prices 200s accelerate russias authoritarianism rise oil gas revenues produce military adventurism fall revenues economic warfare russia yield dividends actual whether physical virtual
questions cannot answered one imagine spectrum answers ranges energy playing central role past 60 years one energy footnote grander narrative todays disputes spring differences along spectrum greater diversification european gas dilute russias energy provocatively weapon even exist desire export oil gas europe lead russias leadership make political concessions russias grand strategy shaped economic engagement coercion falling hydrocarbon revenues make russia less adventurous democratic might weaken russia weaker russia mean west
answers questions unknowable history guide support thesis maybe energy central one write history soviet economy without delving much soviet economy stopped catching united states hydrocarbon revenues rose 1970s suggesting dutch disease although windfall clearly helped falling oil prices 1980s one many shocks economic system unraveling unlike russia soviet economy go recession oil prices fell 1980s although growth low
political front one similarly see energy sidelines broader narrative stent observed hard argue closer economic collaboration led real changes soviet behavior although opened space cooperation lubricated dtente mood favored dtente times trade relationship suffered politics although surprising little rivalry soviet union west affected energy trade almost like geopolitics operated separate planes
energy important trade within socialist world one see soviet union trying balance competing goals need earn hard currency selling oil gas west desire earn high prices hydrocarbons sold within socialist world versus need maintain alliance cohesion avoid centrifugal overt acts economic coercion one also see soviet leadership gradually coming regard cost empire much view partly shaped energy
postsoviet era fall oil prices 1998 exacerbated decadelong collapse nadir haunts russia hard see todays behavior partly reaction low point russia integrated global economy leveraged hydrocarbons propel economy yet political effects economic story harder discern russias slide authoritarianism preceded oil price increase 200s persisted matter happened hydrocarbon revenue foreign policy russia aggressive economy good bad far easier explain russian foreign policy core geopolitical interests dissecting energy prices impact economy
leveraging energy achieve russias grander goals similarly elusive energy blunt weapon difficult wield comprehensive study energy weapon broadly defined postsoviet era concluded usage energy levers appears generated little gain russia terms political concessions least seen open surprising course fits neatly literature economic sanctions generally tend work limited cases special circumstances phrase differently energy good weapon use russia would need engage actual war achieve goals
leave west west russia problem problem springs russian power ambitions energy time divided west strategy toward russia energy debates likely elevated precisely west russia clear idea handle russia policymakers analysts devolve arguments pipelines routes prices supply demand similar topics thus arcane narrow subjects acquire existential quality despite lack better word totally pointless arguments energy often targeted tangible satisfy urge something even something useful effective
west first would help honest debates fundamental source friction rests whether europe needs russian gas whether europe depend russia 25 30 35 percent gas needs whether gas come one route another key questions historical political ones stated side argues russia threat economic isolation best way deal threat thats intellectually honest position one worth arguing need muddy waters nord stream 2 lng
second quite clear analysis neither engagement isolation likely bring desired political effects fair isolation tried considerable extent partly statement feasibility well likely effectiveness west needs robust strategy counters russian influence overseas fills vacuums russian policy exploits buttresses physical virtual defenses vulnerable russian attacks closes social political cleavages russias propaganda excelled amplifying targets wealth russians park overseas hard agenda west things amount energy spent energy really make difference
third energy agenda europe could pursue could dilute whatever influence russia might enjoy energy speedier transition lowcarbon energy greater efforts toward energy efficiency worth pursuing anyway also likely impact relationship russia clarity europes gas trajectory would help europe wants diversify gas supplies also means wants companies invest billions bring gas europe trying ensure europe consume gas contradictions confuse markets undermine energy security
important task however complete internal energy market wellfunctioning market allows gas move around freely would lessen many legitimate concerns exist central eastern europe depending russian gas new projects seem attract attention politicians like ribboncutting ceremonies good photo ops also fundamentally external strategy internal one means stronger regulation combating special interests going court fining incumbents block free movement gas european market opened much due antitrust action due legislation european commissions antitrust case gazproms activities europe could really resolve many longstanding deficiencies european market stronger internal market could render moot vast majority concerns today divide transatlantic alliance
end west rethink link russian energy geopolitics tend overstate much energy matters writing arab world 1970s fouad ajami talked peculiar nature arab real power frustrating difference power resources power ability affect far better starting point thinking energy power general russia particular one make easier deal energy relationship bedeviled transatlantic alliance decades
