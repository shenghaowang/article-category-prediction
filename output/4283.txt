commentators falling last week announce far impotent ukraine crisis united states important weapon growing oil natural gas production could compete world market challenge russian dominance ukrainian european energy us government would change laws allow bounty exported
theres one big problem view united states still net importer oil natural gas economics natural gas exports beyond mexico integrated north american pipeline exports limited ever come reasonable prospect united states ever become net exporter oil
us net imports crude oil petroleum products approximately 64 million barrels per day mbpd estimate sits official us energy information administration eia numbers 55 mbpd net petroleum liquids imports 75 mbpd net crude oil imports understand calculations please see two comments made previous piece number december 2013 latest month complete statistics needed make accurate calculation available
eia forecast predicts us crude oil production defined crude including lease condensate experience tertiary peak 2016 around 95 mbpd alltime 1970 peak decline starting 2020 level far 2013 us consumption 132 mbpd actual petroleumderived liquid fuels number excludes natural liquids substituted petroleumderived liquids limited basis
exactly united states going drown world market oil thereby challenge russian oil export machine plausible answer never expected 2016 peak us production 15 mbpd higher production today thats really quite small compared worldwide oil production 76 mbpd theres guarantee rest world isnt going see decline oil production much supposed us oil weapon taming russian bear
natural gas surely americas great bounty natural gas shale could challenge russians well really true us natural gas production trended significantly postkatrina nadir 2005 trend stalled us dry natural gas production almost flat since january 2012 eia reports total production trillion cubic feet tcf 2012 2428 tcf 2013 rise 09 percent year year
mentioned commentators touting us natural gas weapon us natural gas imports 2013 288 tcf 11 percent us consumption let see understand plan seems import export would change exactly worldwide supply picture
certainly true low us natural gas prices reduced drilling exploration dramatically prices likely rise 6 trend higher time passes shale gas used costly difficult reservoirs remain drillers dont keep drilling unless make money require significantly higher prices
heres kicker order ship us natural gas europe asia liquefied 260 degrees f shipped special tankers cost 6 per thousand cubic feet mcf total cost delivering 6 us natural gas europe around 12 per mcf european liquefied natural gas lng prices mostly level last five years hard see europe logical market japan would better target exports prices moving 15 18 per mcf last five years us entry lng market could conceivably depress world prices make even japan doubtful destination us lng us prices rise significantly 6
presupposes united states excess natural gas export colleague jeffrey brown pointed citi research arm citigroup puts decline rate existing us natural gas production would require industry replace 100 current us natural gas production four years maintain current production
seems us drillers going busy keeping domestic natural gas production dipping let alone expanding allow exports remember still importing stuff today
many companies actually risk billions needed build us natural gas export terminals liquefy load exports may never appear doubt many actually go plans
truly puzzling information ive cost transporting natural available clicks mouse little arithmetic performed tables data got cost information lng money manager specializing energy investments yet commentators reporters editorial writers dont even bother check internet call sources investment business
perhaps facts become irrelevant would explain current hoopla nonexistent us oil natural gas weapon face readily available evidence
