effort reform nations housing finance system senate banking committee chairman tim johnson ranking member mike crapo announced hold markup bill april 29 many details still ironed
given close 100 percent us mortgage market backed federal government good senate banking committee wants improve johnsonccrapo proposal however approach taken johnsonccrapo similar bill senators bob corker mark warner would ensure us mortgage markets slightly remodeled rather completely reformed government would least involved markets prior 2008 crash
prior 2008 crisis fannie mae freddie mac referred governmentsponsored enterprises gses quasiprivate though implicit backing federal government also private shareholders stood lose capital invested companies gses purchased mortgages banks packaged mortgagebacked securities mbs
gses provided guarantees principal interest payments mbs markets generally assumed taxpayers would pick tab gses got trouble handful mortgages backing fannie mae mbs defaulted fannie covered investors losses profits mortgages payments least 20 percent fannie covered losses home loans less 20 percent payment however gses required private mortgage insurance pmi pmi companies turn typically private insurance companies
words mortgage less 20 percent mbs least two sources private capital cover losses pmi company insured portion mortgage default costs gses covered losses covered pmi companies long losses remained normal massive shock system taxpayers never hook losses
2008 crisis far normal proved implied taxpayer backing real crash also proved private capital held gses low cover losses additionally many pmi companies little capital cover losses many pmi regulated state failed given reprieve capital requirements gse shareholders lost capital currently embroiled legal battle us treasury details taxpayer
aside implications regarding shareholder lawsuits problem new approach senate would barely change nature precrisis gse system johnsonccrapo bill example requires position 10 percent private guarantors mbs waives requirement event crisis
though several roadblocks even crisis using taxpayer funds cover mbs losses rules make clear federal government pick 90 percent losses crisis arrangement nominally different old system taxpayers never required cover losses unless shortfalls catastrophic gses effectively private guarantors everyone assumed would covered crisis system envisioned senate would private guarantors know covered crisis
relative old gse system certainly true bills senate would increase amount private capital cover even catastrophic losses gses started higher capital requirements fannie started required leverage ratio 15 1 1968 company leveraged much 200 1
gses capital requirements watered years mainly name expanding affordable housing mission absolutely reason think thing would happen senates approach adopted fact johnsonccrapo approach would give guarantors new safety soundness regulator charged making sure everyone fair access financial services
best approach senate would create series smaller quasiprivate gses higher capital requirements explicit understanding catastrophic losses would covered taxpayers senate approach goes much though creating new government agency intricate new regulatory
congress
reject approach offered senate bills bills would provide explicit taxpayer guarantees necessary
avoid establishing yet another federal regulator us financial markets
adopt policy gets federal government us housing finance market two good examples plan house financial services committee chairman jeb protecting american taxpayers homeowners path act representative justin new fair deal banking housing stability act
members senate banking especially credit taking complex issue however approach put forward largely recreates old gse structure nation go legislative exercise end result system similar one imploded congress leave government embedded business housing finance lawmakers want improve nations housing finance system get government markets
