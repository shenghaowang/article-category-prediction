tell us developed approach
slok yes thats important issue mean ª view successful need get peoples attention saying think sp 500 go extreme level either hire low rather add value thought process add value thought process send chart saying oh unemployment rate going 41 would say okay thank much already know open email already know inflation ª upi 21 unemployment 41 care

send charts inflation unemployment would say okay already know things many things going incredibly difficult quantify difficult assess nevertheless actually play role markets going yes try mix things sort punchy informative sort tell sentences went say well go say obvious already knew could say didnt know whole process getting stimulated getting value think investment process firm turns quite important terms goal
ritholtz youre also economist sort ventures world equity fixed income lot economists certainly fixed income common lot economists steer bit clear think three rosenberg yardeni ed hyman economists whose work see really want talk economy necessarily market
led focus large degree intersection markets economy
slok well lot driven understanding customers certainly also customers fed ecb imf oecd read research course similar minds sat chair 2005 customer translate whatever saying economy something thats useful buying stocks selling stocks buying rates selling rates dollar going prices ª commodity price going
mean input process feel stop short giving investment advice much thats interesting problem economy driver financial markets many things going relevant
phd ph economic models interesting living life limitations talk doesnt mean thats way financial markets functioning many things outside phd ph fed models actually turns quite important good question think important come additional value talk real business cycle models complicated things
mean ª problem tell something really complicated whole challenge really tell something easy understand still say wow actually find useful also find quite interesting
ritholtz want talk little many factors go equity markets lead something wrote think late last year 30 market risks 2018 lets discuss
slok yes try beginning every year think hard risks economy risks broadly market participants worrying making list last years year actually grew 30 thought many things going miss something would shame
clear risks categorized different buckets one risk cause traditional risk call organic risk economic risks business cycle higher risk overheating higher risk recession sectors economy balance consumption balance capex balance financial markets balance banking sector ª case housing market balance many risks list focusing first traditional oldschool macroeconomic risks terms cycle whats next coming quarters overheating recession
short answer first bucket worry still today lot overheating inflation recession risks course still slowly playing second part list
ritholtz wait let stop right get second part
ritholtz five months four months later see fed saying rates going continue tick variety indications full employment certainly close unemployment 4 may even see three handle sometime coming soon
ritholtz yet inflation signs inflation signs wage pressure slight havent seen inflation tick like might imagine would happen full employment verge overheating economy explain risk 2018 overheating economy
slok absolutely one big mysteries expansion still quite seen inflationary upward pressure weve waiting long fed crying wolf inflation go rates go market pricing fed fund futures matter street expectations also crying wolf say rates going rates going rates didnt go last four five years expected
could certainly ask question expect still saying risk makes today different years ago following things namely first today issue unemployment rate low relative years ago suggesting economy close overheating relative congressional budget office close full capacity metrics actually little bit full capacity thats number one reason different today relative years ago
second reason also see upward pressure inflation dollar actually going remember dollar goes see inflation goes thats also second reason
slok absolutely also adding whats happening upward pressure inflation third reason still think inflation 2018 coming potentially already next months enormous fiscal expansion
slok fiscal expansion also something years ago also putting upward pressure fourth final argument different think wolf finally come believe discussion trade war tariffs also modest upward pressure prices
add things together full capacity dollar going fiscal expansion trade war tariffs talk also lifting prices modestly think end year inflation talking core pce well feds 2 target fed 2 target last five years many people meet rates say target long overshoot
well risks could getting close inflation data got core cpi different inflation indicator 21 bottom line trend friend look whats happening inflation get worried fed actually raising rates many times saying potentially also resulting steepening yield curve later year long rates could
ritholtz would quiet people saying flattening causing recession lets hold come back want push back inflation necessarily agree heres ª heres counterargument want hear response
three pieces full employment compare current full employment 20 years ago lot people lost good highpaying middleclass jobs replaced mediocre lowpaying jobs hospitality industry food beverage service lowend healthcare full employment wage picture skewed dramatically across middle class thats bullet point one
two three still technology driving price everything automation making things faster cheaper better lastly even trade war globalization continues drive prices drive labor cost global labor arbitrage
respond way top head im sure real economist unlike faux economist could give even credible counter arguments inflation
slok well first observation fed saying want hike rates three times year four times next year got think really hard thought process saying rates go much worried forces globalization amazon things could holding inflation permanently wouldnt firm view among incredibly smart people fmc ph rates go much next years
think one thing thats really important keep mind good points remember cpi cpi inflation weight cpi goods third weight cpi services two thirds really critical true china holding us inflation true amazon holding us inflation modestly also true mexico countries competitive pressure holding inflation us goods make third words tradable goods make third index whereas stuff index meaning services makes two thirds services first housing housing downward competitive pressure globally housing makes 40 cpi overall core cpi means actually important part
slok healthcare makes 20 cpi thats also something healthcare cost also moment going also globalization pressures amazon pressures
finally education costs also make significant share cpi complaint often hear among hedge funds others well prices never go except healthcare education housing well wait minute components make two thirds cpi
think reason look actual inflation rates services around 2 12 3 almost last decade inflation goods indeed negative important part arguments listed critical part discussion customers whether well ever see inflation weight goods third think much money actually spend going strip malls going amazon going elsewhere shopping
share spent goods actually relatively small compared much spend mortgage rent much spend healthcare much spend education
ritholtz im hearing deflation things want inflation things need
slok thats good way put
ritholtz lets jump rest 30 market risks 2018 talked economic risks noneconomic risks youre considering year market
slok well basically fall big bucket called political risk geopolitical risks includes everything talking markets talking happening us politics whats happening european politics recently also discussed quantitatively happening japanese politics
also debating quite time happening course north korea recently started debating syria situation risks incredibly difficult quantify nevertheless turn pretty important markets moving problem nobody really great tool box political risks great tool great light post give us lot light economics problems therefore spend enormous amount time trying look individual economic indicators ª suddenly something comes political risk left field didnt expect suddenly need view good news bad news big story
big story small story quantify like recently got trade war stuff come radar screen big deal big deal discussions equity investors think thats big deal rates investors think big deal macro implications relatively limited
whole noneconomic list risks ª distinguished features dont really good understanding good way really assessing actually cases makes exciting discuss
ritholtz completely agree fascinating discuss always find pushing back political risk market want throw couple ideas get thoughts
2017 measures politically volatile year certainly recent memory certainly memory didnt live 30s live world war 2 cant tell politics like 2017 ª like campaign never ended got louder volatile
yet time market volatility lowest weve seen like 30 years slow modest wind every day end year sp 500 gained 22 including dividend
thats huge huge contradiction contextualize politics markets
could explain
slok yes absolutely mean right say predictions ahead many elections including us election things would gone completely different actually happened tells difficult cases get good quantification assessment whats actually going happen think important keep mind economics broader textbook politicians really accountable generally speaking called fiscal policy structural policy central bank case fed basically responsible basically one thing namely interest rates monetary policy really keeping interest rates level think relevant economy
think important backdrop also happened 2017 monetary policy many many years easy sense driving markets might fiscal policy structural policy politicians could dominating force many many years actually fed ecb boj maybe reason stock market well long since 2009 essentially equities done incredibly well simply amount support coming fed also ecb boj sp even pboc china weve seen significant money printing needed find home outside fixed income many cases outside fixed income basically cases means equities equities probably also benefited intention significant amount money printing
ritholtz even 2017 fed tightening quantitative easing ending balance sheet dont want say getting ª shrinking certainly expanding way
slok global central bank thats true barry right say fed actually pulling wasnt putting liquidity look global central bank balance sheet ecb still popularly speaking printing money boj still printing money also happen china also supporting economy
ritholtz let ask point apologize interrupting cycle globally seem much major economic centers much step sync normally global everybody cuts rates together everybody raises seemed like us japan abenomics europe eventually said hey guys seem onto something
ritholtz started ª unusual mean economy markets going forward
slok well whats really unusual cycle exactly way outlined sequenced remember central banks buying assets specifically course ecb boj still buying assets fed many years buying basically government bonds used work imf would fly countries say dont buy government bonds thats crazy youre monetizing death market think youre credible
central bank fed buying government bonds ecb buying government bonds boj buying government bonds sit say oh yes fine get away
issue really true markets distorted significant amount asset purchases qe carried three major central banks therefore exit beginning slowly go fed raising rates next year ecb raise rates eventually boj also raise rates exit associated unwinding distortions
lot client discussions exactly said namely kind distortions created sequencing saw would endgame get back normal situation possible get back normal situation asset prices heavily distorted central bank asset purchases qe
ritholtz mentioned ecb fed japan central bank actually buying equities dont dont see us dont believe see lot europe
ritholtz central bank japan impact japanese markets abenomics working one giant distortion tell
slok yes abenomics three arrows namely monetary policy fiscal policy structural policies attempt say lets make economy competitive lets make easier fire japan lets make easier hire lets get women labor force lets try get economy flexible dynamic
answer fiscal side debt level enormous monetary policy tried many different things hasnt really created significant amount success stories unfortunately despite almost 20 years plus counting
ritholtz 200 gdp something like
slok debt gdp level exactly makes vulnerable high interest rates answer today question hasnt really worked quite yet course opens lot questions us also going road japan eventually dont think problem japan economy dynamic enough ingrained reasons difficult create inflation whereas spoke earlier already seeing signs inflation us cpi pce small upward moves mentioned list reasons think bit different also labor market dynamic us employment cost index trading higher
weve seen median weekly earnings trending higher weve seen even label cost also starting move bit get average hourly earnings hasnt really moved much least recently end day think get wage pressure get therefore get different situation us higher rates fed hiking also different level interest rates compared japan going
ritholtz discuss structural issues japan referring referring post office essentially retirement accounts ª japan different us know different mean structurally
slok one extremely important difference demographics japanese population ageing therefore actually shrinking labor force whereas us actually still growing labor force may grow little bit less quickly earlier still significant amount immigration still population growth us one important structural ª simple terms structural differences amount tax payers japan falling whereas us amount taxpayers still growing adding labor force people pay taxes could help aging population help paying retirement payments transfers older generations medicare medicaid whereas dont really japan really weighing government finances also weighing economy broadly
ritholtz know want talk little career path somewhat dont want say unusual lots people go government institutions banks wall street meandered europe paris new york tell us right graduate school princeton correct
slok yes get phd copenhagen spend year princeton got americanized opened eyes wonderful country

ritholtz way memory serves economics department powerhouse
slok well time
slok bernanke chair department also ken rogoff also time didnt interact time mean know professes want talk phd students incredibly lucky also wanted talk
yes true really interesting ground getting academic overview whats going different areas specializing areas wrote
ritholtz imf oecd next step
slok yes spend year bank america new york go oecd paris oecd paris former managers imf moved deutsche bank specifically david still pleasure working today great colleague binky chadha asked wanted come work deutsche bank new york 2005 said yes ive sitting chair last 12 13 years counting enjoying every moment
ritholtz thats pretty fascinating wall street dozen years different today joined right middle credit housing boom
slok well think one important difference 2005 2006 obviously much fewer worries things actually turned really important gotten much humble first terms forecasting ability also terms actually need look also gets back little business model today sending chart sentences well idea cannot look certain small set indicators risk im missing something actually could turn extremely important
straw breaks camels back necessarily inflation employment could something coming blue appreciated enough inflation risks come different sources importantly recession risks come whole range different sources
would say last least decade important change way economic professions street working got open eyes risks asking constantly risks important risks playing something spending time
ritholtz lets delve little bit think im going ask question little bit skewed way think potential risks much either investor class economist class might overlooking
slok well think sort number one organic risk spoke earlier upside risks inflation could say economic profession also fed crying wolf years invasion come
maybe uncertainty risk two also risks think important first fiscal expansion requires lot net issuance treasuries expand amount safe assets world expand amount treasuries outstanding basically beginning compete riskfree asset risky assets exactly seeing sense tbill issues competing libor competing commercial paper probably even competing ig suddenly offer investors lot riskfree assets meaning assets basically risk associated case us treasuries investors course say would rather riskfree asset rather risky asset credit risk risk credit rating
amount riskfree assets expanded higher risk investors start pick riskfree assets relative risky assets may sound abstract means practical terms us government needs essentially double issuance treasuries next 18 months pipeline 2017 2019 risks associated risky assets meeting ig highyield loans clos even mortgages risks fixed income assets begin increase simply crowding spread product fixed income assets relative whats happening treasuries
ritholtz line thought thats existed suggests theres shortage high quality sovereign debt past 10 20 years
ritholtz isnt new set issuance kind getting back normal supply seems theme normalizing rates normalizing inflation normalizing sovereign treasury supply
slok absolutely think lets say pension fund insurance company begging high interest rates many many years high interest rate suddenly begin appear 10 year treasury rates moved modestly consensus look bloomberg screen see consensus expected move three later year suggest riskfree asset suddenly gives high return question becomes well crowd willingness invest investment grade credit risky assets therefore risk view yes true need see normalization 2007 round numbers total us government debt around 9 trillion going towards total amount government debt outstanding 21 trillion meaning expanded dramatically last decade amount treasuries outstanding thats beginning compete
really test market really imf page 1 enough demand us treasuries get course bit extreme get situation like venezuela zimbabwe emerging markets suddenly problems financing government finances
obviously us nowhere near problems many emerging markets really beginning ask em style question us namely happened countries expand fiscal situation much us happens credit rating happens exchange rate dollar go happened interest rates happens matter politically situation certain needs ph incredible increase financing needs
recession course financing needs go also need pay unemployment benefits et cetera short answer question true want see normalization treasury issuance matter treasury yields normalization coming time big expansion think significant risk financial markets coming quarters
ritholtz earlier referenced possibility trade war lets discuss tariffs issue lots folks looked new tariffs steel aluminum arguments back forth china almost big surprise come lets honest candidate trump campaigned protectionism whole slogan make america first every whistle stop going erect tariffs going get rid nafta going throw trade agreements really say surprised
know process takes like year implement really say markets surprised president campaigned talked consistently still talks constantly actually said going
slok completely agree youre saying surprise sense globalization benefiting tremendously people china mexico emerging markets benefited tremendously open us economy global open trading system
also saw tremendous benefits consumers others living us buy goods people europe buy goods saw cheaper goods ever seen many different fronts basically anywhere anything bought goods spectrum
also need recognize course important part certainly people west virginia pennsylvania ohio basically lost didnt produce goods anymore didnt produce steel anymore political process telling us going put scale benefits might cheaper goods someone china got job goes produce goods us buying stuff relative unfortunate situation many people us europe lost jobs open trade globalization
sense surprise weve gotten thats course main problem politicians struggling compensate lost name globalization europe us make sure dont fall gotten point looks like point return politicians everything us also europe try find solutions making sure lost global trading system open benefiting much cheaper goods hurting much
ritholtz recently conversation someone started career 1970s ask period scar terms inflation low returns stock market spiking interest rates
started career least wall street right midst would later turn credit bubble housing collapse colored view world
slok yes would say going spent time street period crisis basically period trying figure wrong economics textbook wrong financial system wrong way analyze things didnt ª couldnt predict better ª deutsche bank number warning pieces ahead crisis rest really nobody anywhere predicted crisis would coming particular force magnitude actually happened
lot way think things lot agenda think things try help clients think whats going much colored fact cannot stone unturned make sure lift every area cover every base actually absolutely sure theres nothing terms risks missing world also created mean lets say way markets much stressed situational also buy side people seeing crisis everywhere
slok constantly someone saying oh god something happening got make sure turning everything creating next recession
ritholtz old expression every general fights last war
slok thats true dont know many times last 10 years essentially 2009 left recession received emails clients saying next recession around corner wasnt sitting well maybe really important investment notifications ph view think things today risks overheating today much higher risk recession importantly significant tailwind fiscal expansion
yes still watching ª question still watching lot different risks think need investors constantly monitor everything going thats also created much confusing environment cases dont whatsoever toolbox understanding type risk

welcome podcast
torsten thank much looking forward conversation
slok thank
ritholtz ive mentioned im fan research ive figure way new rules im getting figure way get back full ª full plan ª talk afterwards
many questions much time let let choose ones think really worthwhile
tell us favorite economic indicator think important ill ask whats underrated whats overrated
slok think ism historically proven highest correlation gdp would say despite every month long time go wait another economic indicator thats definitely top list
course nonfarm payrolls many jobs creating unemployment rate close second terms employment report wealth information whats going economy sectors better sectors worse
ritholtz headline numbers whats beneath
slok think value headline value think value underneath terms informing us economy going
third final indicator course thing worry moment various indicator inflation specifically core pce first preferred measure inflation tells indicators spoke first namely ism unemployment overheating need stimulus business cycle informing cycle turns quite important pure macro perspective would three areas three indicators look
ritholtz think indicator people rely much probably overrated
slok think ª mean number things people pay lot attention mean one area least generally speaking people pay maybe much attention jobless claims indicators like jobless claims really derived many people show jobless claims measures new jobless claims many people show unemployment office week asked claims first time
ritholtz affected weather effect holidays drives
slok many things go mean general trend generally helpful still think ª get good deal attention mainly highfrequency still think doesnt anywhere near amount wealth information get employment report
im willing wait another month see economy maybe longterm patience economist relative someone managing money
ritholtz lets talk equities little bit mentioned look world continuous cycle market cycle
slok yes clear first business cycle indeed getting old problem argument business cycle doesnt run clock case six years 10 years business cycle starts die
business cycle slow need imbalance rollover normal three imbalances starts recessions starts business cycle slow therefore start big impact equities either much consumption much capex meaning imbalance consumption imbalance capex imbalance financial markets
look consumption moment dont really much imbalance contrary really dont understand consumption still weak side likewise capex business fixed investment need private investment companies dont really imbalances either
finally fourth quarter financial markets big question essentially youre asking imbalances equities imbalances rates imbalances credit imbalances fx generally speaking think answer think fact got huge fiscal tailwind recently suggest see solid gdp growth rest year
see solid consumption growth rest year see solid capex growth capex also got design fiscal package also grow continuously answer question still think equities well still think rates slowly go higher fed gradually hike rates think problems spoke earlier trade issues generally relative value assets us think dollar generally speaking equity continue well pe ratio got adjustment recently downside definitely still room equities rise mainly economy enter recession anything risk either begin economy overheat
ritholtz heard trade wars good thing easy win dont recall read read someone recently true trade war china possible trade war china might mean
slok risk market perspective really interesting trade law putting essentially higher prices either things import higher prices things export theyre ª case chinese retaliate think means means first prices things import start go dont know theyre going whole question become corporate well playing field look like future prices inputs prices product im selling kind inputs buy substitute things might gone tariffs coming
uncertainty associated dont know kind tariffs coming next even dont know list tariffs already coming dont know retaliation probably companies meaning holding back little bit hiring holding back little bit investment result uncertainty playing field look like plan ahead corporate
downside trade wars really equities particular equity names comes airplanes cars soybeans suddenly specific names equities benefit doesnt benefit
equity perspective makes sense equities go trade wars come also important remember size tariffs 50 billion total imports us 22 trillion total magnitude tariffs actually relatively small macro perspective thats probably rates havent moved probably also say dollar hasnt moved much simply rates really dont move much macroeconomic conditions would change rates move
makes sense view summary equities liking trade balls whereas really seeing much movement rates front meaning interest rates really havent moved much macro impact tariffs probably going relatively small
ritholtz mentioned earlier pe ratios coming makes ask pretty record high corporate profits sustainable profits high much credited really low borrowing costs see future corporate profits looking like next couple quarters
slok yes companies become extremely efficient many ways since financial crisis seen significant amounts cost cutting important part become efficient across sectors sp 500 increased efficiency form costcutting basically making things lean mean generally competitive domestic us also globally certainly benefited corporate america tremendously important first answer question cost come companies become efficient
looking ahead course tailwind trump tax cut got december corporate thats going boost earnings even
ritholtz fact saw lot early earnings released past weeks
ritholtz big surprise like wasnt expecting upside surprise bank america ª financial seem well number companies seem much better expected lot goes new lower corporate rates
slok absolutely barry lowered corporate rates 21 35 high level struggling many years sense got situation corporates benefiting incredibly efficient lean also getting huge tailwind higher profits top course repatriation incentivizing invest
key conclusion earnings growth would continue strong least rest year
