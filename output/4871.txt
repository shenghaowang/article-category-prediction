remaining hopeful one deliberately wronged mh370 passengers boosted muchshared online post christopher goodfellow former pilot something malfunctioned goodfellow surmised sharp turn left made flights first hour fact swift attempted reroute pilot nearest runway could land 1300foot strip pulau langkawi largest island archipelago 104 andaman sea
goodfellow theorised likely fire electrical fire suggested planes transponder acars aircraft communications addressing reporting system shut casualties scramble tackle blaze case fire first response pull main electrical busses restore circuits one one isolated bad one said adding crew could incapacitated smoke could land leaving plane fly six hours autopilot eventually crashing
goodfellows theory comfortingly simple suffered major shortcoming malaysian authorities said plane appeared rerouted second time first sharp turn third tracking device planes engines continued sending intermittent electronic pings via satellite ground another six hours indicating plane continued fly
final ping put last known position one two arcs investigators said electronic pings put last known position one two arcs circle emanating satellite detected one arc north china south indian ocean western coast australia goodfellows assumed autopilot could taken plane either destination
pings accurate plane turned said patrick smith airline pilot author aviation autopilot tells went also unlikely plane could carried flying hours indeed suffered fire mechanical catastrophe smith concluded strong theory
accident
discovered two separate communications systems turned investigators said concluded mh370 victim hijacking sabotage movements consistent deliberate action someone plane malaysian prime minister najib razak said little solid evidence produced cited malaysians conclusion reached still two theories followed
pilot copilot responsible
attention focused captain zaharie ahmad shah 53 first officer fariq abdul hamid 27 transponder acars shut someone knows flight crew virtue controls circuitbreaker panels cockpit ability remove power said dennis schmitz veteran engineer executive aviation communications industry malaysian ministers also initially said 15 march news conference one communicating systems switched last known verbal message cockpit c right good night
authorities later backtracked admitting know exactly systems shut pilots show signs radical activity although shahs support malaysian opposition leader jailed day flight much analysed pair also request fly together appear upstanding professionals according several profiles adding confusion us officials briefed reporters recent days plane first manually rerouted final verbal signoff c indicating foul play cockpit someone technical knowhow red flag said smith
shah kept flight simulator home malaysian officials said wednesday files removed several weeks ago experts looking logs cleared malaysian police inspector general tan sri khalid bin abu bakar told reporters news conference hishammuddin hussein defence acting transport minister appeared confirm reports fbi asked help analyse files said looked local international expertise
b plane hijacked someone else
plane deliberately sabotaged pilots responsible someone else plane must malaysian military radar appeared show missing airliner climbed 4500 feet descending steeply new york times reported could potentially indicate struggle cockpit however report also prompted speculation knowledgeable flyer deliberately flown high attempt deprive board oxygen thus knocking even killing
remains lack consensus among experts precise technicalities acars full disabling system requires circuits broken cockpit also electronics bay according smith bay found beneath flight deck indicating someone involved one point outside cockpit

yet men travelling stolen passports appear seeking asylum europe clear connection terrorism militant groups background checks passengers crew turned likely suspects china announced unearthed nothing untoward profiles twothirds passengers chinese commandeering plane disabling communications systems flying smoothly would require organisation expertise would seem difficult hide
however message claiming responsibility taking plane appears left passenger group claimed responsibility c state obvious c nothing appears done
plane
northern two arcs identified investigators possible locations plane sent final ping sweeps southern northwestern china prompting speculation mh370 might flown south asia towards smaller central territories could landed even suggested could parked awaiting use future terrorist attack hundreds planes airports depots world smith pointed take one force whole world look
kazakhstan krgyzstan quickly singled potential landing spots yet governments stressed would detected plane even onboard equipment switched impossible fly silent mode serik mukhtybayev deputy head kazakh civil aviation committee said statement also military bodies monitoring countrys air space dair tokobayev vicepresident kyrgyzstans main civilian airport told reuters plane fly kyrgyzstans territory
plane reached arc several hours losing contact ground would probably needed avoid detection several major militaries region countries protect locations radar sites researchers estimate china alone 30 longrange systems
must longrange radar said ron ruggeri veteran airtraffic controller instructor vaughn college aeronautics technology plane go way somebody would seen went things also little onedge part world know plane id expect scramble jets find
b plane flew somewhere else

however maldives government swiftly dismissed suggestion based monitoring date indication flight mh370 observed military radars country said maldives national defence force statement adding airport radar come short
rupert murdoch chairman fox suggested twitter plane might effectively hidden perhaps northern pakistan like bin laden pakistani government firmly rejected notion said plane detected radars indian officials also pushed back speculation plane flew country

experts stress south likely prove fruitful look would best intelligence said dr todd curtis former airline safety analyst boeing us view whats going world white house announced last week despatching seventh fleet indian ocean signalled likely location since australians taken lead
