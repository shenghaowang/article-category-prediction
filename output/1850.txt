new network protocols improve net take gain acceptance
really need new network protocols short answer yes sure existing set network protocols worked surprisingly well attempts improving frequently resulted improvement however smart people identified significant changes fundamental protocols simplify networking real question whether changes significant enough justify adoption
working well need new protocols examine layers functionality required implement security nat qos content management gets complicated quickly layers interact one another proposed protocols potentially result network simplification ipv6 supposed improve security examination revealed significant security holes neighbor discovery automatic tunneling
new protocols
named data networking
ndn relatively new network protocol changes devices computers tablets phones retrieve data want view version networking retrieves data name instead identifying data based server located example popular online tv program could referenced name instead servers hosted ie amazoncom programs name may still include publishers name data could stored multiple places internet making access faster think scaledup version content distribution network cdn even better different versions data different names allowing access specific versions
understand works needed highly recommend watching new way look networking presentation van jacobson one premier network researchers world acm interview van jacobson fills operational details
sorell recent jitter blog ipv6 tactical ndn strategic suggests ndn play different role envision regardless view ndn fulfills important role evolution networking combination efficiency improvement enhanced trustworthiness data compelling arguments possible negative factor ndn requirement store state information possible location named data ie pending interest table feature streamlines process finding content name
first look suggests ndn useful retrieving static content like web pages streaming media video audio acm interview see link jacobson described using ndn replace udp two laptops purpose conducting audio call two endpoints known names ethernet interface unplugged call able continue discovering alternate path systems
nice thing ndn runs whatever infrastructure exists ipv4 ipv6 highspeed optical networks lowspeed adhoc networks thats needed begin adding ndn routers key parts internet immediately begin see benefit data distributed locations closer recipients see link reports gartner estimates ndn early phases implementation may take ten years deploy thats likely reasonable figure absent reason accelerate process ie congestion collapse internet
expect ndn viable options looks like clean transition minimal bumps road advantage able operate transport interesting set experiments done interactive video conferencing sessions run see testing successful identified several areas additional investigation refinement
recursive architecture
new initiative rina effort reexamine fundamentals networking simplify operation john day involved design arpanet examined internet protocol architecture book patterns network architecture analysis determined network communications really layers function interprocess communication ipc observation results great simplification ipc mechanism used throughout networking stack requirement adjust parameters operate different scopes
rina uses nested scopes higher layers larger scope lower layers good explanation rina found project current work reported society
neat thing rina addresses need functions like security qos nat mobility without need extra features protocols reading protocol found interesting factoid 1982 richard watson proved reliable transport requires three timers based packets maximum lifetime protocol start end connection needed dispense syn fin parts tcp connection would improve speed reliable connection setup big factor web pages want access many different components multiple servers implication syn attacks possible
ive written need simplify plethora network protocols required build functional networks every network layer existing tcpip model one unique protocols must properly configured operating order support applications ultimately business depends applications whenever discover new network problem solve address creating new mechanism protocol distribute protocol data
several organizations working rina see links rarely see mention general network reading reading tends focused operational things instead research theres amount involved
expect rina take many years accepted accepted number devices use ip stack would big impediment already transition ipv6 executives want understand need make similar move rina whether worth effort depend well solve problems rina addresses qos nat security mobility network security particular key factor well continue work set mechanisms weve developed address problems tcpip
enhanced ip
enhanced ip ietf doc address expansion mechanism new protocol uses ip option 26 double size ipv4 address space existing network equipment easily handle enhanced ip packets except forwarding packets containing options explicitly denied result 64bit ip addresses systems nat patched handle conversion
enhanced ip proponents claim ip code modifications 400 lines length 100 times smaller code ipv6 ive seen security analysis enhanced ip would like see several security studies make sure doesnt expose something proponents havent considered
enhanced ip reminds tuba socalled using big addresses one alternatives current ipv6 suite main objective enhanced ip tuba larger address space
downside enhanced ip also requires modification ip stack end nodes proponents claim change minimal easily handled loadable kernel modules small patches getting changes corporate computing world challenging much less work required outfit active personal computers internet
easy ip ezip
easy ip slides also address extension mechanism uses existing ipv4 reserved address space 2404 set semipublic routers spr increase address space conceptually addressing works similarly local dialing central office exchange centrex telephone systems local numbers behind spr visible across internet global routing done 2404 addresses
ezip advantage needing deployment handle 2404 address space however network devices dont expect see packets address space discard devices would upgraded need address space protocol might simplest deploy
summary
four protocols active development problem see making required changes impacted systems around world solution doesnt encompass every single legacy endpoint viable solution work reasonable percentage global ipv4 systems
really reach widespread adoption depends deployment enabling infrastructure endpoint vendors microsoft apple android linux etc network equipment vendors cisco juniper arista etc provide necessary functionality chance making something happen case years solutions develop critical mass necessary widespread adoption
looking future networking
datadriven network next step networking
