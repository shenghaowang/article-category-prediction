russias invasion ukraine given boost calling united states expedite natural gas exports help allies overseas thinking american gas exports ª form liquefied natural gas lng ª boon domestic economy also potent geopolitical tool wielded kremlin
never mind united states wont first lng export terminal operation late 2015 earliest approved gas exports already committed longterm contracts ukraine even single terminal receiving lng
even without newly concocted geopolitical rationale exports though washington seems favorably disposed permitting much americas surplus gas migrate overseas since beginning shale gas revolution kicked 2005 us department energy approved six lng export terminals combined export capacity 85 billion cubic feet day projects works
put gas service foreign policy saving europe russias claws asia toxic air ask one question arent using gas cars trucks
americas newly cheap gas finds way electricity sector displaces coal fuel source coals share total electricity generation declined 51 percent 10 years ago 40 percent today percentage continue drop obama administration persists effective ban new coalfired power plants shift coal gas brought 10 percent decline us greenhouse gas emissions power plants since 2010 according environmental protection agency negating political pressure costly carbon capandtrade schemes shale gas industry also created 60000 jobs stimulated economic growth reduced consumer costs products derived natural gas plastics household chemicals fertilizers make food benefits pale comparison could achieved gas replaced oil instead coal
first little math best way compare energy sources look cost per unit heat measured british thermal units spot price 1 million btus expressed mmbtu derived natural gas 430 price us coal less current oil prices price 1 mmbtu derived oil roughly 17 means pure economic standpoint upside replacing coal natural gas zero replacing oil natural gas 127 per mmbtu put differently current prices 35 trillion cubic feet gas energy information administration assumes united states exporting annually starting next decade valued 15 billion amount gas stayed united states used power cars trucks would displaced depending technology 3 million 4 million barrels oil day eliminating oil imports cost 100 billion 150 billion year instead united states exporting 15 billion worth energy import equivalent amount energy 10 times cost make sense
reason economic malpractice transportation sector wedded oil natural gas landed power sector necessarily electricity economic use commodity grid electric appliances indifferent source energy goes making electrons use light bulb coffee machine electrons made coal gas nuclear solar
cars different story care source energy goes tank part run nothing petroleum fuels means matter cheap plentiful natural gas becomes pathway vehicles blocked
although efforts increase use natural gas automotive fuel limited heavyduty trucks buses therefore get us close capturing full economic opportunity offered shale gas revolution consider current trajectory according energy information administration increased use compressed natural gas liquefied natural gas vehicles offset 3 percent petroleum consumption transportation sector 2040 profoundly disappointing figure natural gas bonanza benefit every american must penetrate lightduty sector 60 percent transportation fuel used
one way reduce cost converting lightduty gasoline car cng right process comes roughly 1000 per lightduty vehicle three times average price tag parts world streamlining onerous regulatory requirements consumers currently facing epa could make option widely available
another option turn gas gasoline diesel process called gtl plant make money barrel oil cost 16 times natural gas ratio high expect long run royal dutch shell recently abandoned 20 billion gtl project louisiana
fiscally prudent way using natural gas transportation open lightduty vehicles run liquid fuel called methanol highoctane alcohol blended gasoline much way ethanol blended properly adjusted flexible fuel vehicles cost automakers 100 manufacture cars allow drivers choose whether run methanol gasoline combination fuels congress provided automakers right incentives within five years substantial part americas fleet would capable running methanol ª additional cost taxpayers
sure coming years times natural gas prices inch oil prices decline highly unlikely oil ever become cheaper natural gas per unit energy arbitrage opportunity shifting oil gas transportation sector appealing let go long cars locked gasoline americas natural gas go fuel power plants asia europe instead cars home sellers gas may indifferent ends americans whole amounts scandalous waste opportunity
