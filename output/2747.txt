human ear fascinating organ detects sound converts electrical impulses translated brain meaningful information speech music ear composed three parts outer ear middle ear inner ear
outer ear consists auricle also called pinna ear canal eardrum function outer ear pick sound vibrations send ear canal make eardrum vibrate
middle ear composed three tiny bones called ossicles commonly known hammer anvil stirrup connect eardrum inner ear vibrations eardrum amplified tiny bones passed inner ear
cochlea main component inner ear thousands hair cells grow along cochlear duct convert sound vibrations middle ear electrical impulses impulses sent auditory nerve brain perceives sound
process ears picking sound brain comprehending converted electrical less second hearing loss occur number ways almost result breakdown system

men twice likely sustain hearing loss compared women according national institute deafness communication disorders applies especially men age range 20 69 part discrepancy men women may due occupational differences higher percentage men jobs expose excessive amounts noise construction workers firefighters
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids well acetaminophen aspirin may also blame found cause higher rates hearing loss men younger 60 fact men aged 50 59 33 percent likely experience hearing loss men age bracket didnt normally use aspirin
ways men women lose hearing age 80 also different women initially experience low frequency hearing loss whereas men normally experience high frequency hearing loss translates men harder time hearing consonants women harder time hearing vowels
womens brains also respond certain sounds differently compared men study national institute child health human development found womens brains usually activate hearing sound babys cry mens brains remain resting state however brains men women activate hear cries autistic babies tend relatively higherpitched

lack sleep also increase risk diabetes obesity diseases also result hearing loss get least seven hours sleep per night increase number hours sleep still find waking tired
sure take regular breaks work many tasks seem difficult impossible complete made less difficult take short interlude address later
individuals work particularly noisy environments like construction sites subway stations increased risk hearing loss taking 15 minute breaks reduce chances sustaining hearing damage work settings take advantage lunch breaks bathroom breaks clear head move quieter place
ever thought multiple assignments time would help complete tasks faster multitasking may actually less efficient making less productive increasing stress levels
try complete tasks one one rather simultaneously find arent getting work done quickly enough ask help completing tasks find methods lessen workload
exercise one best methods counteracting stress even walking 30 minutes day better mood lower stress levels regular exercise like running lifting weights also help maintain normal body weight
obesity diabetes associated hearing loss exercise protect stressinduced hearing loss might also reduce risk hearing loss factors
many factors cause stress resolved extending communication efforts let boss coworkers know create comfortable work environment dont afraid ask questions extra clarity often make assignments easier complete

wait take next puff might affect hearing list negative health effects smoking long ugly ultimately harbinger hearing loss
one five americans roughly 20 percent us population smokers every draw plethora toxic chemicals ingested formaldehyde arsenic vinyl chloride ammonia hydrogen cyanide name substances including nicotine impair hearing cause tinnitus affect balance
smokers 70 percent likely develop form hearing loss nonsmokers smoking combined noise exposure even explosive combination study among manufacturing workers exposed steady noise environments revealed smokers four times higher incidences hearing loss nonsmoking coworkers noisy line work surprisingly prevalence hearing loss among smokers directly related number smoking years
smoking cause hearing loss
smoking deposits nicotine carbon monoxide body tighten blood vessels including ones ears restricts blood flow oxygen inner ear tiny hair cells cochlea responsible translating sound vibrations electrical impulses brain face damage result asphyxiation
nicotine affect chemical messengers auditory nerve damaging severely unable accurately relay sounds brain
another frightening consideration effect smoking around us studies shown clear correlations hearing loss secondhand smoke particularly troubling concerns children since auditory system usually fully developed late adolescence
hunting challenging entertaining sport using rifle potentially harmful hearing proper precautions arent taken quite surprisingly 95 percent hunters 38 percent target shooters reported wear hearing protection shooting past year
researchers university wisconsin found men aged 48 92 regularly participated hunting likely experience highfrequency hearing loss risk increased seven percent every five years man hunting
hunting sport comes inherent number risks including hearing loss steps take protect hearing listed
using gun suppressor silencer reduce amount sound made firearm silencer works stabilizing loud propellant gases normally given shot fired sure check state regulations regarding legal status silencers hunting range
sure take 15 minute breaks hunting noise level involved rifle shots damage ears exposure lasts 15 minutes resulting ear damage make especially difficult communicate teammates hunting sessions
using relatively lowvolume rifle silencer regular basis reduce chances suffer hearing loss magnum barrel make significantly less noise 375 ruger barrel muzzle brake
