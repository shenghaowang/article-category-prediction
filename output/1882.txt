2016 new onboard intelligence capabilities drones commercial regulatory guidelines use cases coming together create substantial nearterm impact operational efficiency
drones poised become viable solution kinds businesses near term june 2016 us federal aviation administration faa cleared path commercial drone use establishing rules include airspace speed pilot certification guidelines operators watershed moment enterprises would benefit data collection time drone rd never shown potential
drone swarms robot new innovations could enable
today drones power range new business services early 2016 pwc estimated total available market services 1273 billion fastestgrowing service areas infrastructure transportation insurance media entertainment see later article summary capabilities business impact
drones quickly gaining new physical artificial intelligence ai networking capabilities new capabilities lead application scenarios might considered
happens aerial drones example also climb crawl using one mode
swarms drones learned cover area collectively could 3d map entire building within hour
backend systems process data could itemize quantify compile bill materials replacement network water pipes building within another minutes
blending capabilities far though lot would depend highly integrated backend systems intelligence data preparation reporting functions
one thing able climb well fly another scan map globally share mapping previously unknown constantly changing environment capabilities however although cant stay air hour climbing hanging dwelling data collecting possibilities drones means one drone could one area camera running hours
drone swarms could deployed different sections warehouse building could scan full area simultaneously assuming bandwidth available new use cases underscore potential drone robot 3d mapping drones drone swarms
drones biggest impact
key market segments nearterm drone services infrastructure agricultural words inspection monitoring sizable physical assets need protected nurtured maintained pwc estimates total available global market two segments alone exceeds 77 billion remaining exception media inspection oriented
although theres considerable buzz delivery drones many industry observers regard delivery drone specialized application remote places dont transportation infrastructure boats ships sea disaster relief scenarios focus data collection analysis asset management protection increase greatly near term applications like insurance adjustment infrastructure inspection drones extend enrich data footprint reduce workforce requirements
service providers companies drone fleets must deal ingesting fusing modeling data numerous sources activities encompass drone cameras sensors also sensors deployed various airborne platforms including satellites
chief technology officer yuan gao drone data service provider notes service providers help surveying also analyze process data thats challenge working dont think single farm somewhere able achieve need ingest vast amount data build model
drone data collection relatively new practice drone service providers business users must contend many factors
data collection generally done onboard batch mode still images together uploaded mission appropriate consider possibilities newest 3d mapping realtime streaming possibilities best unless organization military secure wireless broadband unless lte cellular available reliable collection area many remote locations cellular coverage longrange reliability may lacking case
onboard sensor expensive agricultural surveys visible infrared imagery must collected capture adequate data crop health 3d mapping single laser ranging module called cost several hundred dollars drone
drones complement rather replace data collection methods perhaps mature commercial drone use agricultural infrastructure surveys data service providers continue rely heavily satellite manned aircraft kinds imagery
data service provider landscape emerging offering drones help simplify data collection analysis service providers likely take burden aircraft operations management also data management modeling analytical application development
drones essentially mobile sensor data collection vehicles businesses think using kinds data drones collect start maximizing visibility root causes key problems werent able solve easily ask instance could drones help
improve efficiencies oil companies conduct safety inspections pipelines much quickly help drones gas leaks thermal imaging
increase accuracy supply chain professionals design warehouses optimize use drones scanning inventory
extend reach existing workforce rail companies using drones inspect tracks bridges mining companies use monitor equipment track mining progress
accelerate decision making drones get large assets disaster recovery scenario example launching one drones give decisionmakers quick sense scope damage injury suffered
accelerate planning process surveyors example cut time required collect mapping data hours minutes swarms drones efficiencies multiply
deliver distinctive public relations product promotion aerial photography becomes much costeffective adaptive drones available altitude event photos give sense space scale possible ground level
reduce maintenance costs identify solar cells solar panels werent working crews using infrared cameras needed walk entire array drones work fraction time
get insights point time need identify study fix problems quickly efficiently previously could whether problem row crop impending bridge failure wind damage roof office building
faas rulemaking announcement confirms commercial drone use become truly viable 2016 end decade range potential use cases expand especially drones become capable
