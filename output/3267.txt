today fastest broadband service comcast offers widely double speed time warner offering market said time warner offering 100mbps service kansas city google deployed service time warner cable also offer 100mbps service austin texas att google pledged build 1gbps fiber networks
course people questioned comcast shown technology achieving broadband hasnt offered speeds valid question ive asked company claims isnt enough consumer demand indeed high prices comcast cable operators likely charge super highspeed connections likely case
given fact time warner cable never considered leader terms broadband speeds hard argue merger comcast market would losing competitive force driving industry toward connections

att verizon tremendous pressure cable operators brannon said many ways technology superior cable operators
downside deal consumers one company would unprecedented control cable channels cant seen millions americans even whether independent programmers would economically viable moffett said argument comes fact since comcast controlling many nations tv subscribers already controls lot cable content via acquisition nbc universal company much negotiating power cases control programmers

also fears merger would lead similar level control broadband networks moffett pointed raises set concerns surrounding net neutrality fear comcast control much nations broadband infrastructure force content providers pay fees threaten block intentionally slow traffic moffett said even concerns likely overblown
broadband concerns likely attract reactions moffett said truth told rules governing anticompetitive behavior probably already relatively well suited prevent anything egregious including almost violations net neutrality without net rules
