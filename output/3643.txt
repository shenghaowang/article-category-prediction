nearly eight years ago began time chairman one priorities make federal reserve particular make monetary policy transparent open reasonably possible believed today transparency monetary policy enhances public understanding confidence promotes informed discussion policy options increases accountability monetary policymakers reaching mandated objectives ultimately makes policy effective tightening linkage monetary policy financial conditions real economy course responding financial crisis aftermath soon became federal reserves main focus turned however following stabilization financial system supporting economys recovery deepest recession since great depression required prominent role communication transparency monetary policy ever
remarks discuss federal reserves communications evolved recent years enhanced transparency increasing effectiveness monetary policy despite challenges inherent communicating unprecedented economic policy environment future imperfectly foreseen explain believe policy transparency remains essential element federal reserves strategy meeting economic objectives
policy frameworks communication
understand critical role federal reserves communications monetary policy played recent years useful start discussing role monetary policy communication generally including relationship policy communication broader policy framework
making monetary policy sometimes compared driving car policymakers pressing accelerator brakes depending whether economy needs sped slowed moment analogy imperfect however least two reasons first main effects monetary policy actions economy felt immediately instead play quarters even years hence unlike driver car monetary policymakers cannot simply respond lies immediately front must try look well difficult task second effects monetary policy economy today depend importantly current policy actions also publics expectations policy evolve automotive analogy clearly breaks current speed car depended car expects driver future
publics expectations future monetary policy actions matter today expectations important effects current financial conditions turn affect output employment inflation time example investors choose freely holding longerterm security rolling sequence shortterm securities longerterm interest rates today closely linked market participants expectations shortterm rates evolve monetary policymakers expected keep shortterm interest rates low current longerterm interest rates likely low well else equal short monetary policy expectations matter
indeed expectations matter much central bank may able help make policy effective working shape expectations experience demonstrates useful approach managing dovetails well basic principles policymakers stating clear objectives well plans attaining objectives example past two decades many central banks introduced explicit numerical targets inflation supplemented regular publication central banks economic forecasts provisional plans achieving objective medium term numerical inflation goals helped increase transparency predictability policy number economies
spirit federal open market committee fomc clarified federal reserves objectives policy strategy dual mandate congress specifies maximum employment price stability policy objectives federal reserve could adopt numerical inflation target exclusive goal would appropriate fomc simply provide fixed objective measure employment unemployment parallel inflation objective contrast inflation determined monetary policy longer run maximum level employment sustained longer run determined primarily nonmonetary factors demographics mix workforce skills labor market institutions advances technology moreover factors evolve maximum employment level may change time consequently beyond power central bank set longerrun target employment immutable independent underlying structure
approach fomc agreed described statement longerrun goals policy strategy issued january 2012 reaffirmed january statement begins affirming fomcs commitment meeting statutory objectives indicates context fomcs dual mandate committee sees price stability corresponding 2 percent longerterm inflation goal employment side mandate committee makes best assessment maximum level employment given time recognizing assessments necessarily uncertain subject revision practice committee often expresses employment objective terms longerrun normal rate unemployment currently fomc participants estimates longerrun normal unemployment rate publicly reported quarterly summary economic projections range 52 6
noted explicit objectives useful accompanied provisional plans achieving many central banks supplement announced objectives published forecasts implicitly explicitly lay plans achieving goals although size diversity federal reserves policymaking committee made achieving single consensus forecast difficult quarterly summary economic projections reports fomc participants view likely future paths inflation unemployment output growth conditional individuals view appropriate monetary policy recent years survey also included participants projections path future shortterm interest rates see likely achieve committees goals general committees two objectives maximum employment price stability complementary fomc stated pursue balanced approach pursuit dual mandate working ensure inflation employment close desired values longer term
short federal reserve like many central banks around world made significant progress recent years clarifying goals policy approach providing regular information future path policy views likely attain objectives increased transparency framework policy aided public forming policy expectations reduced uncertainty made policy effective
financial crisis aftermath however raised even greater challenges demands federal reserves communication contend persistent effects financial system collapse housing prices construction new financial shocks europe elsewhere restrictive fiscal policies levels government course enormous blows output employment associated worst us recession since great depression moreover first time since fomc began using federal funds rate policy interest rate rate effectively zero thus cannot lowered meaningfully consequently provide needed support economic recovery minimize risk deflation federal reserve adopt new policy tools bring communication challenges remainder talk discuss federal reserve used communication try inform publics expectations fomc employ currently two principal policy tools plans regarding shortterm policy interest rate largescale purchases securities
forward guidance policy interest rates
economy weakened 2008 fomc repeatedly cut target federal funds rate shortterm policy rate december year target funds rate reduced range zero 14 percent money market rates declined nearly zero thus using standard means easing monetary target interest longer possible
socalled zero lower bound fomcs policy interest rate challenge committee faced first depth recession combined ongoing concerns functioning financial system raised significant uncertainties likely pace recovery effectiveness monetary policy supporting growth recoveries postworld war ii us recessions relatively rapid production unemployment key variables returning close normal levels within six eight quarters cases policy horizon relevant financial markets might next several quarters aftermath recent crisis however committee consider possibility highly accommodative policy might required number years
second federal funds rate effectively zero created important asymmetry policy planning one hand economy recover rapidly inflation increase monetary policymakers would able respond normal way raising federal funds rate hand economy remain weak recover case actually fomc would able cut funds rate moreover latter case economy could face increased risk prices case japan illustrates deflation may impede economic growth difficult escape try preempt outcomes strong case existed monetary policy accommodative suggested standard policy rules calibrated normal
committee faced situation monetary policy accommodation needed possibly quite long basic policy tool federal funds rate target pushed limit put committees problem another way standard policy rules range analyses implied achieve fomcs objectives target federal funds rate set well zero course feasible fortunately discussed earlier degree accommodation provided monetary policy depends current value policy rate public expectations future settings rate committee accordingly realized could ease policy reduce uncertainty future assuring public markets intended keep policy rate low time longer period public initially expected
first committee employed purely qualitative language send message fomc stated december 2008 would likely appropriate federal funds rate remain near zero time changed formulation march 2009 extended however language convey precisely committees intentions august 2011 committee introduced specific date guidance stating conditions would likely warrant keeping federal funds rate target near zero least datebased guidance precise qualitative language committee using appears effective communicating fomcs commitment highly accommodative policy particular following introduction dates fomc statement interest rates survey measures policy expectations moved ways broadly consistent
although datebased forward guidance appears affected publics expectations desired explain future policy would affected changes economic important limitation indeed date guidance pushed twice late 2014 public unsure whether circumstances changes guidance might december last year fomc addressed issue tying forward guidance policy rate directly economic introducing socalled statecontingent guidance committee announced first time increase federal funds rate target anticipated long unemployment remained 612 percent inflation inflation expectations remained stable near formulation provided greater clarity factors influencing committees thinking future policy thinking might change outlook
colleagues frequently emphasized conditions stated guidance thresholds triggers crossing one thresholds automatically give rise increase federal funds rate target instead signal appropriate committee begin considering whether increase target warranted threshold formulation helps explain committee willing express guidance bearing labor market terms unemployment rate alone instead following usual practice considering broad range labor market indicators judgment committee unemployment despite drawbacks regard probably best single summary indicator state labor sufficient defining threshold given guidance however unemployment threshold crossed many indicators become relevant comprehensive judgment health labor market including measures payroll employment labor force participation rates hiring separation particular even unemployment drops 612 percent long inflation remains well behaved committee patient seeking assurance labor market sufficiently strong considering increase target federal funds rate
largescale asset purchases related communication
severity recession disruptions financial markets shortterm interest rates near zero lower bound became clear early monetary accommodation would needed could provided management shortterm rates alone even guidance rates would kept low well future accordingly time fomc reduced target federal funds rate close zero began supplementing rate policies forward rate guidance largescale asset purchases open market purchases longerterm us treasury securities securities issued governmentsponsored enterprises primarily mortgagebacked securities mbs
lsaps forward guidance federal funds rate support economy putting downward pressure longerterm interest rates affect longerterm rates somewhat different channels understand difference useful decompose longerterm interest rates two components one reflects expected path shortterm interest rates called term premium term premium extra return investors require willing hold longerterm security maturity compared expected yield rolling shortterm securities period
noted forward rate guidance affects longerterm interest rates primarily influencing investors expectations future shortterm interest rates lsaps contrast directly affect term premiums federal reserve buys larger share outstanding stock longerterm securities quantity securities available privatesector portfolios declines securities purchased fed become scarcer become valuable consequently yields fall investors demand smaller term premium holding argument depends importantly assumption longerterm treasury mbs securities fed buys perfectly types assets assumption seems well supported
forward rate guidance lsaps affect longerterm interest rates use tools allows monetary policy effective even shortterm interest rates close zero however committee view two tools entirely equivalent one reason much less experience policies designed operate term premiums lsaps result though strong majority fomc members believes forward rate guidance lsaps helping support recovery somewhat less certain magnitudes effects financial conditions economy changes pace purchases accumulated stock assets feds balance sheet moreover economists good understanding would like factors determining term premiums indeed saw earlier year shifts term premiums source significant volatility interest rates financial conditions lsaps drawbacks associated forward rate guidance including risk impairing functioning securities markets extra complexities fed operating much larger balance sheet although see issues deciding employ lsaps fomc accordingly remained attentive possible costs risks well efficacy less familiar tool point committee regularly noted postmeeting statements course elevated unemployment belowtarget inflation lingering economic fragility harmful effects longterm unemployment society economic potential also pose significant costs risks committee thus far judged balance favors use lsaps
november 2008 june 2012 fomc announced extended series asset purchase programs case specifying expected quantities assets acquired program like use datebased forward guidance announcing program predetermined size duration advantages disadvantages one hand fixed program size straightforward communicate hand program fixed size cannot easily adapt changes economic outlook consequent changes need policy accommodation announcing programs fomc state general willingness indeed followed statements left considerable uncertainty regarding conditions might warrant changes existing program introduction new one
step roughly analogous shift datebased guidance contingent guidance use federal funds rate target september 2012 fomc announced program asset purchases total size purchase program would fixed advance instead would linked committees economic objectives particular committee initiated purchases agency mbs rate 40 billion per month stated intention continue purchases outlook labor market improved substantially context price december 2012 program extend maturity feds portfolio treasury securities came end fomc added purchases 45 billion per month longerterm treasury securities new program bringing monthly purchase rate 85 billion remains today
noted committee set criterion substantial improvement outlook labor market condition ending new purchase program committee also signaled expectation would end purchases return emphasis rates policy forward guidance fully attained dual mandate objectives stating committee expects highly accommodative stance monetary policy remain appropriate considerable time asset purchase program ends economic recovery reason sequencing choice greater uncertainty costs efficacy lsaps relative familiar tool managing current shortterm interest rate forward guidance expectations future shortterm interest rates moreover extent use lsaps engenders additional costs risks one might expect tradeoff efficacy costs tool become less favorable federal reserves balance sheet expands
seen progress labor market since beginning latest asset purchase program september 2012 committee agreed june year provide guidance criteria would inform future decisions program consequently press conference following june fomc meeting presented framework linking program explicitly evolution fomcs economic outlook particular noted committees expectation time improvements job market would continue supported moderate pickup growth would support gains committee additionally expected inflation would moving back toward 2 percent objective time incoming data broadly consistent outlook committee would likely begin measured reductions pace asset purchases later 2013 economy evolved anticipated end purchases would occur around midyear 2014 also emphasized path purchases would depend incoming data could slower faster envisioned modal noted pace purchases could increased time warranted
framework discussed june implied substantial additional asset purchases subsequent quarters likely even purchases possible economic developments proved disappointing however following june meeting press conference market yields moved sharply higher example fomc meetings june september 10year treasury yield rose 34 percentage point rates mbs increased similar amount
financial market movements often difficult account even fact three main reasons seem explain rise interest rates summer first improvements economic outlook warranted somewhat higher natural healthy development second rise rates reportedly reflected unwinding appear premised essentially indefinite continuation asset knockon liquidations positions response investor losses rise volatility although brought tightening financial conditions unwinding associated rise term premiums may benefit reducing future risks financial stability particular lowering probability even sharper market correction later point third market participants may taken communication june indicating general lessening committees commitment maintain highly accommodative stance policy pursuit objectives particular appeared fomcs forward guidance federal funds rate become less effective june market participants pulling forward time expected committee start raising rates manner inconsistent
extent third perceived reduction feds commitment meeting increase yields neither welcome warranted judgment fomc change expectations correspond actual lessening fomcs commitment intention provide high degree monetary accommodation needed meet objectives committee participants emphasized subsequent communications
september 2013 meeting fomc applied framework communicated june committees decision meeting maintain pace asset purchases appropriate fully consistent earlier guidance committee looking evidence job market gains would continue supported pickup growth happened implications outlook evidence reviewed september meeting mixed best ongoing fiscal debates posed additional risks committee accordingly elected await evidence supporting expectation continued improvement labor although fomcs decision came surprise market participants appears strengthened credibility committees forward rate guidance particular following decision longerterm rates fell expectations shortterm rates derived financial market prices showed continue show pattern consistent guidance
coming meetings evaluating outlook labor market continue consider cumulative progress since september 2012 prospect continued gains seen meaningful improvement labor market since latest asset purchase program announced september 2012 time latest reading unemployment rate 81 percent privatesector economists projecting slow reductions unemployment coming quarters recent reports payroll employment also somewhat disappointing however since program announced unemployment rate fallen 08 percentage point 26 million payroll jobs added looking forward course continue monitor incoming data reflected latest summary economic projections october fomc statement fomc still expects labor market conditions continue improve inflation move toward 2 percent objective medium term views supported incoming information fomc likely begin moderate pace purchases however asset purchases preset course committees decisions pace remain contingent committees economic outlook committee also continue take account assessment likely efficacy costs program
ultimately asset purchases slow likely economy progressed sufficiently committee rely heavily rate policies associated forward guidance substantial continued holdings securities maintain progress toward maximum employment achieve price particular target federal funds rate likely remain near zero considerable time asset purchases end perhaps well unemployment threshold crossed least preponderance data supports beginning removal policy accommodation
conclusion
began time chairman goal increasing transparency federal reserve monetary policy particular response financial crisis deep recession feds monetary policy communications proved far important evolved different ways would envisioned eight years ago
economy made significant progress since depths recession however still far would like consequently may time monetary policy returns normal settings agree sentiment expressed colleague janet yellen testimony last week surest path normal approach monetary policy today promote robust fomc remains committed maintaining highly accommodative policies long needed communication policy likely remain central element federal reserves efforts achieve policy goals
