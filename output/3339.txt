couple weeks ago took swipe bank england speech governor mark carney unrealistic dangers bloated financial sector godzilla good march 3 today im opposite im cap researchers threadneedle street new paper money creation modern economy gives truly realistic explanation money created really matters virtually everything economic textbooks say money wrong
bank going gangbusters get message across introductory paper money two short videos money money creation shot gold vault clearly wants economic textbooks throw neat plausible wrong rubbish currently teach money connect real world instead
economic textbooks teach students money creation twostage process start banks cant lend rule called required reserve ratio specifies ratio deposits reserves theyre required hold 10 cents reserves back every dollar deposits deposits 10 trillion reserves 1 trillion banking sector cant lend money anyone
stage one textbook money creation model fed bank england gives banks additional reserves say 100 billion worth stage two banks lend customers deposit right back banks hang 10 per cent 10 billion lend remaining 90 billion process iterates additional 1 trillion deposits created reserve ratio restored 11 trillion reserves 11 trillion deposits
model goes name fractional reserve banking aka money multiplier depending political persuasion either outright fraud youre austrian persuasion like mate mish shedlock way things youre mainstream economist like paul krugman latter case lets conventional economists build models economy completely ignore existence banks private debt money supply completely controlled fed
new paper bank england states emphatically fractional reserve banking neither fraud way things myth rightly blames economic textbooks perpetuating paper doesnt beat bush comes divergence reality economic textbooks spout fact paper explains
rather banks receiving deposits households save lending bank lending creates deposits p 1
normal times central bank fix amount money circulation central bank money multiplied loans deposits p 1
rather banks lending deposits placed act lending creates deposits ª reverse sequence typically described textbooks p 2
money multiplier theory useful way introducing money banking economic textbooks accurate description money created reality p 2
relationship deposits loans relationship reserves loans typically operates reverse way described economics textbooks p 2
believed tooth fairy would hope emphatic denunciation textbook model would cause macroeconomics lecturers drastically revise lectures next week im long tooth delusion theyll ignore instead
dominant tactic call ignorance economics lecturers wont even know banks paper exists continue teach whatever textbook bible theyve chosen inflict upon students secondary one know ignore theyve ignored countless critiques mainstream economics third arrow quill challenged students hint hint argue textbook story useful parable beginning students realistic vision introduced advanced courses
bank england unfortunately given useful politely pretending money multiplier model useful way introducing money banking course feint pure firstly model utterly misleading useful introduction nature money banking book genesis introduction theory evolution people believe money multiplier model rarely get heads around reality bank lending creates money drastic effects level economic activity
secondly undergraduate lecturers gets better higher line ruse masters phd level courses continue ignore banks though mainstream modellers introducing sorts financial frictions models noah smith pointed recently none sterling exception michael imf actually incorporating banks capacity create destroy money models
admit reality banks create money lending money destroyed debt repayment point admit took time appreciate simple equilibrium parables conventional economics fly window particular level economic activity depends lending decisions banks repayment decisions borrowers banks lend rapidly borrowers repay slowly boom reverse slump bank england puts new loans simply make old ones repaid effect new loans exceed repayment aggregate demand increase
two main possibilities could happen newly created deposits bank says first suggested tobin money may quickly destroyed households companies receiving money loan spent wish use repay outstanding bank loans
second possible outcome extra money creation banks lead spending economy p 7
realistic handson perspective bank england declares money matters macroeconomics affects level economic activity really shouldnt big deal people actually believe anyway incredibly mainstream economics pretends money affects prices impact temporary one real activity monetary disturbances fault government read central bank anyway quintessential market institution like bank couldnt anything wrong could
leading economists cant ignore paper blithely dismiss footsoldiers profession seriously doubt let challenge current position
particular curious see whether paul krugman notes paper reacts krugman visible aggressive defender proposition banks dont matter including throwing haymaker making case bank england making
particular keen asserts putting banks story essential krugman wrote 2012 im including banking sector stories relevant crucial story debt leverage
keen says include banks lending increases money supply ok matter seems assume aggregate demand cant increase unless money supply rises thats true velocity money fixed suddenly become strict monetarists wasnt looking kind model gauti use lending much increase aggregate demand problem
since krugman continued press belief banks mere intermediaries lending ignored macroeconomics
yes commercial banks unlike financial intermediaries make loan simply crediting borrower new deposits theres guarantee funds stay said article commercial banks creators money
piece wrote banks another kind financial intermediary size banking sector ª hence quantity outside money ª determined kinds considerations determine size say mutual fund industry
directly contradicted points antipodean heterodox economist threadneedle street expect riposte kiss principle loans create deposits argument technically true doesnt make real difference macroeconomics
krugman certainly cant dismiss bank england staffed banking mystics brushed contrary views others
