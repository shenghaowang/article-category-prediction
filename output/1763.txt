physicians order medical procedures patients procedures largely paid third parties government insurers private insurers legally obliged cover medically necessary care whatever patients little motivation travel far search competitors offering care lower prices single hospital nearby able provide care dictate high reimbursement fees
systems insulate patients true costs care hospitals without nearby competitors able leverage strong patient preference geographic convenience demand premium insurers desire hospitals take advantage situation yielded cumulative process mergers must branded units dominate local roughly 500 hospitals united states 1998 2012 mergers acquisitions involving total 2277 thus hospitals aggregating fewer larger economic units inflating market power principal effect mergers reduce price competition forcing payers negotiate single entity encompassing hospitals given geographic region turn gives merged entities greater leverage extract higher reimbursement private public payers
waste yet resulting problem primarily even mostly one profits prices soared nonprofit forprofit hospitals indeed 2012 vast majority community hospitals america 499 79 percent either governmentowned notforprofit rather increasing profits investors inflated hospital incomes instead tend dissipated across multitude medical personnel auxiliary staff suppliersÂªas well wasted unused capacity reality monopolies economic sectors dominated nonprofit organizations health care education produce broadly diffused inefficiency overpayment organizational bloating rather supernormal profits

bargaining power hospitals ability impose price increases therefore depends ease insurers may omit provider consolidation systems bargain collectively insurers across multiple markets enables hospitals make harder command price increases twice thus effectiveness selective contracting checking hospital cost growth blunted highly concentrated hospital ability insurers insist good prices hospitals hobbled willing provider laws majority states require insurers reimburse providers willing accept insurers rates effectively limiting ability health maintenance organizations hmos divert patients preferred effect reverse slowdown growth health care expenditures achieved previous years areas high hmo

government regulations evidence monopoly power allowed hospitals push prices without improving quality led policy analysts political activists claim expanded government regulation control providers make health care affordable end number prominent obamacare advocates called followup round hospitals regulatory caps prices aggregate spending limits costeffectiveness requirements heightened antitrust
yet proposals attack symptoms monopoly power instead addressing causes result likely create new problems solve existing ones attempt drive costs regulatory price controls expected induce artificial scarcity reduces incentives providers invest improve quality respond patient similarly problems inflated costs excess capacity unlikely solved preventing mergers genuine competition providers meet patient needs lowest cost likely advanced encouraging hospitals pursue profits antitrust suits
ultimately advocates regulatory solutions invariably fail acknowledge degree problem hospital monopolies artificial created government regulation
innovators shake hospital monopolies
absent government subsidies regulations protect competitors hospitals unlikely enjoy outsized market power long health care subject substantial natural barriers entry increased institutional size often burden advantage
larger hospital systems face greater administrative challenges identifying waste motivating doctors staff keep costs control general hospitals lack internal price signals allocate resources departments must rely bargaining cajoling shift needed upgrading rationalizing capabilities also likely difficult administrators incentives hoard spare capacity physicians motivated deem care necessary prevent resources reallocated elsewhere makes hard hospital managers crosssubsidize care practice even intentions indeed cross subsidies often tend dissipated higher spending technologies services uncertain
