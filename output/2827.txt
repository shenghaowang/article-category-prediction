irrespective whatever market one timing factor utmost importance accumulating physical possession gold silver time continues one trust elites via controlled western governments political leaders marching incessant drum fiat takeover destruction every possible nation control ukraine example clumsy doomed fail attempt bring strategically important russia nation rotten fold central banker control collapse us power us dollar worlds reserve currency falls latter stages happening best reliable financial saver value physical gold silver recognized everywhere world except western central bankers inevitable collapse fiat federal reserve note frn aka dollar lead devaluation everything held form paper currency bank accounts bonds stocks pensions etc
everyone chooses hold form paper asset suffer financially suffer dramatically everyone owns personally holds physical gold silver survive much better shape perspective matter paid bought silver 40 45 even 48 reason buying recently 21 gold paid high 1700 recently 1300 higher prices pms time planed routine purchases form protection ravages fiat destruction like said last week price temporary possession permanent
time ever concern overpaid wasted rearview mirror regret gotten pms cheaper focus price misplaced focus financial survival year early far better day late
