first whats especially difficult security decision decide early 60s long know answers questions health life expectancy two decision irrevocable
unfortunately decisions made early game decision take social security option take defined benefit plan made generally irrevocable said chuck yanikoski president still river retirement planning software

instead using breakeven analysis brown recommends using alternative frames much spirit nasi toolkit sort framing said increases intended claiming ages 18 24 months
indeed tool kit nasi suggests older americans consider breakeven age life expectancy deciding take social security instance nasi notes average 65yearold male expect live 19 years age 84 average 65yearold female expect live 22 years age 87 addition nasi suggests nearly four 10 women three 10 men age 65 today expect reach age 90
brown however suggest trying decide claim social security focus less average life expectancy odds living long time concern focusing life expectancy rather full distribution longevity possibilities one could inadvertently put people back mindset thinking terms breakeven dates rather thinking sustainability consumption said brown indeed one pet financial planners financial planning software rarely discuss longevity risk opposed average life expectancy
said brown arbitrary extension life expectancy conservative substitute fulsome discussion longevity risk one explicitly consider risk around average life expectancy one never see annuity appropriate solution would like trying sell fire insurance instead discussing risk house burn point average 1 everyones house burn year
others however different point view social security decision significantly different longevity issues said yanikoski financial planners need look extralong life scenarios usually trying figure amortize savings ª obviously planned amortization using life expectancy leaves 50 people catastrophe
social security isnt like said none choices leads catastrophic outcome regardless happens yanikoski said social security task avoid catastrophe optimize chance getting best result way plan around likely longevity outcome
experts meanwhile say factoring life expectancy social decision important needs personalized conspicuously absent however many people roughly 50 live life expectancy longer said steve mitchell consultant oculus partners founder stephen w mitchell associates important question every potential beneficiary ask totally missing discussion industry discussion outliving retirement income whether overall average life expectancy good estimate personal life expectancy personal health family history factors factored individuals decision

many cases good health dont smoke good family history mitchell said calculating personal life expectancy reinforce key message may live longer expect social security becomes increasingly important source income get older however others poor health family history premature death like mitchell said considerations different course married couples spouses expectancy need considered complex social security claiming strategies may provide significant benefits mitchell said
exercise creating personalized life expectancy worthwhile one one shouldnt go overboard practice instance yanikoski considers sex smoking status fivelevel selfevaluation current factors health
course possible pushing people claim age 70 might best interest think usually prudent use exaggerated life expectancies make social security decisions said yanikoski although seems conservative terms longevity risk pushing social security claiming toward age 70 severely reduces shortterm income exchange potential future gains
people modest financial means yanikoski said paying big premium front hope future benefits even hope odds extent assume life expectancy view conservative risky fundamentally imprudent gambling said dont think encouraging
others meanwhile remind us retirement planning exercise retirementincome planning static onetime decision said diane savage certified financial planner educator requires attention throughout retirement many course adjustments
many factors related retirementincome management controllable even though like think said appears many attempts create certainty around something far certain
best plans said provide guaranteed income sources well income sources adapt move forces beyond control retiree appropriate path provide certainty retirementincome stream said savage best advice someone planning retirement income given prepared flexible
