public pension programmes around world financial trouble continuing increases life expectancy number eligible retirees rising rapidly tax revenue available finance benefits
united states congressional budget office projects relative cost programmes oldage pension benefits rise quarter next 25 years 49 per cent gross domestic product gdp today 62 per cent 2038 taxes earmarked support automatically rise faster gdp either growth rate benefits must reduced tax rates must increased
one reason rapid rise benefits stems adjusted current law retirees benefits automatically adjusted account increases traditional consumer price index cpi experts long understood overstates true increase cost living resulting benefits fixed
part problem reflect consumers change composition purchases time relative prices change president barack obamas administration initially followed expert advice suggested traditional replaced accurate measure known chainweighted cpi although would reduce annual rate increase benefits 025 per cent outlays inflationindexed programmes next 10 years would 200 billion lower applying chainweighted cpi adjustments would raise 100 billion period
another fundamental reason traditional cpi overstates true rise cost living accurately reflect introduction new goods services improvements quality existing goods services unfortunate mr obama recently withdrew proposal change traditional index preferring political gesture protecting social security benefits responsible policy correcting way benefits taxes reflect rising prices
important reform stabilising financing social security pension benefits adjust benefits rise created social security programme 1930s legislation specified benefits would paid retirees age 65 age 65 rose one year per decade today age 65 six years higher 1940 increase number years put social security financial trouble
congress responded 1983 gradually raising age full benefits 65 67 individuals want retire early 62 still fair reduction benefits alternatively work longer receive higher benefits
course decision increase age full benefits never going politically popular congress therefore careful delay start gradual adjustment applying age 45 time legislation higher age fully phased 2027
result public generally unaware decade 1983 legislation age full benefits would eventually rise pollsters asked voters whether would favour increase social security age improve programmes financial stability response overwhelmingly negative
politically important fact time member congress propose legislation changed delay eliminate rise eligibility age full benefits congress acted responsibly slow growth benefits even though reversing increase eligibility age would politically popular
since 1983 legislation enacted life expectancy age 67 increased another three years bringing 85 every reason expect life expectancy continue rise future rate one year per decade
obvious solution current future social security financing problem reprise 1983 legislation gradually raising age full benefits 67 70 appropriate actuarial adjustments earlier later retirements life expectancy age 67 roughly 18 years would equivalent reducing average lifetime benefits onesixth present value benefit reduction actually higher given reduction comes start retirement period
would even better avoid future political posturing enacting legislation automatically raises eligibility age full benefits way average life expectancy threshold kept constant 15 years
experts object principle increase eligibility age full benefits lowincome groups experience rise life expectancy simple solution problem would relate age full benefits paid individuals average lifetime earnings
fundamental reform would shift pure payasyougo system mixed system combines current benefits investmentbased personal retirement accounts investmentbased annuities would natural supplement lower payasyougo benefits would result raising eligibility age full benefits
obviously retirees deserve advance notice benefits reduced important us many countries around world act make changes needed stabilise future pension finances
