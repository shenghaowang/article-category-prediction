culture enjoy aspects culture find difficult adjust
one thing chinese sense loyalty
boss even 10 years would still think boss feel commitment one things admire australian culture different direct selfconscious think trying selfconscious difficult thing overcome initially asia difficulty reading lines people didnt understand asked cant come tell
understand aspect caring fact bother read
lines opposed expecting people tell takes lot adjust sensitive side culture able read peoples inner thoughts without told explicitly think learned lot made better person understanding person
challenging issues facing current position
took one year adjust w brand concept means constantly
trying invent new different ideas although w offers highlevel style service service always formal often casual much easier formal often events pool parties 300 400 guests loud music dancing midnight time adjust hotel guests needs example banker tries check 300 morning sees wild party full swing difficult adjust times
work enjoy much actually lose track
time planning well important successful business dont
usually lose track time think time lose track time end day say 700 pm start work things like answering emails signing checks etc thats could lose track time

eyes employees single important quality
think understanding difficult make judgment calls
leading several hundred employees lot issues going everyday need feedback order understand circumstances understanding person information know happening challenges people facing help guess lot talking people different levels organization hotel annual program every manager must work one day junior staffs position could housekeeping chef engineer order understand difficult jobs
opinion single best quality employees possess
curiosity need hardworking disciplined course first like
things like
employees grow way grow taking interest curious learn grow also people hotels tend form tight teams need curious outside teams always encourage people take interest departments work learn work
dont like old thing thats something grown
since joined w brand always reinvent things encourage people things differently internally guests could every hotel w easier approach look something elevate brand capturing peoples interest generate profit time trade though example team serving japanese restaurant way 10 years become really good
