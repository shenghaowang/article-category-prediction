bodies motion often stay motion
appreciating real terms first four months fallen sharply last five weeks dollar basket increasingly looks like yuan move reflection dollars gyrations mechanics basket peg
broad terms yuans value dollar back level pegged back 2008 2009 first part 2010 appreciation occurred obama administrations first term reversed
yuan currently bit weaker cfets basket stabilized second half 2016 close level reached basket spring summer 2017 significant movement would push bottom edge trading range basket past two years told tradeweighted yuan depreciated 10 percent 2015 peak
china think three broad options
hold line either basket dollar assume china would prefer hold line basket even trade war escalates us imposes tariffs growing share chinas exports
attempt another managed depreciation moving yuan basket offset economic impact trumps tariffs china perhaps help offset economic impact chinas fiscal tightening efforts financial sector long worried chinas external surplus might rebound china pulled back stimulus adopting structural policies needed bring national savings rate
let currency less end currency management exit isnt real doubt yuan would float face weakening chinese data us pboc tries offset domestic weakness tightening fiscal credit policy additional easing ultimately pulls chinese rates us rates
view real options
dont think china forced depreciation
market pressure chinas currency depreciate materialized recently flows quite stable earlier year back yuan stable appreciating appreciating basket may much last 18 months also appreciating dollar
anything chinese policy makers tap market keep yuan appreciating bit know thats conventional wisdom thats balance payments data foreign exchange settlement state
chinese residents adding assets abroad last quarters squirreling private funds ongoing outflows errors omissions tourism imports outflows policy banks continued external offset rising external borrowing chinese state banks inflows bond market effective controls limited nonstrategic fdi previously avenue hot outflows swing fdi balance actually offset deterioration current account balance called basic balance current account plus fdi rising recently
suggests least china clearly signaled didnt want yuan depreciate could hold line relatively easily addition 31 trillion formal reserves pboc state banks net foreign asset position 500 billion cic 270 billion foreign portfolio see pg 67 2017 annual report
depreciation pressure right stems large part expectations china wants weaker currency response trumps tariffs slowing domestic uncontrolled outflow pressure
impact tariffs chinas trade shortrun appears manageable 10 tariffs 500 billion trump reduce chinas exports 50 billion relative baseline assuming shortrun elasticity around 1 perhaps bit time tariffs expected permanent incentive reorganize supply chains like longrun elasticity likely well 1
chinas exports us strong upward trend prior trade numbers first half year would suggest rise 50 billion 2018 netnet chinas exports us might fall back 2017 level 2019
thats china could view absorb blow 10 tariffs tariffs set level isnt prohibitive especially china pockets roughly 5 depreciation past two months dollar yuan back ten years ago even though chinas economy far productive technologically sophisticated
conversely china wanted could take plunge shift floating currency let currency float weaker yuan would add real burden chinas foreign currency debts debts arent big least relation chinas 12 trillion economy
real risk china float would interpreted signal chinas leaders lost ability manage chinas complicated finances thus could prompt runs parts chinas financial system safe assets abroad point robin brooks emphasized see ft alphaville article pboc without external constraint would free provide liquidity needed keep system seizing observation complexities providing support weaker shadowy parts financial institutions lack sufficient highquality assets access pboc directly would still need support
chinese float course would also major shock world chinas neighbors would likely respond letting currencies depreciate would lot collateral damage europeans example would hurt weaker yuan fall asian currencies
plus well pretty clearly risk us would view sharp move even truly shift least time marketdetermined exchange rate escalation trade war ten percent tariffs might go twenty europe faced wave exports highly competitive china might face pressure follow us implement tariffs go back qe effort push euro
end chinas currency management thus might trigger full shift managed trade mitigating trade gains china would normally expect weaker currency
finally china historically hasnt managed economy letting prices go want stepping back currency management would huge shift chinas broader economic management isnt clear china willing take plunge
leaves middle ground controlled depreciation
technically managed depreciation one hardest things central bank pull
controlling move hard part especially time chinese interest rates close us interest rates means isnt large penalty holding dollars rather yuan example chinese exporter borrowing yuan buy dollars position short currency outright
yuan expected depreciate tomorrow next month next year basically makes sense hold dollars rather yuan move managed tend burn reserves china firsthand experience lost trillion dollars reserves managing depreciation 2015 2016 said 500 billion fall reserves explained chinese banks firms paying external debts change reserves net chinas external debt much smaller swing headline reserves even though channels outflows subsequently closed level domestic foreign currency debt fallen china faces similar risk expectations yuan one way bet allowed build
anyone pull controlled depreciation china
controls course play role gaming border impossible takes bit dont exportimport business naturally foreign exchange entire monetary base cannot pick leave
china still lot external assets anyone else far external assets external debt pboc cic big state banks well 4 trillion combined external assets debts 15 leaves substantial position following graph sums reserves core assets state banks compared banks core debt foreign holdings chinese bonds
imfs china team right argue imfs reserve metric poor guide chinas reserve need put need somewhere 1 3 2 trillion see paragraph 44 staff report us 1 trillion threshold implied composite metric floating exchange rate capital controls low us 29 trillion threshold fixed open regime high
leaves lot free foreign exchange use china wants possible china could say pull another 10 move basket without burning another trillion reserves
move would offset projected impact trumps 10 tariffs exports us 2025 chinas total exports shortrun elasticity trade tariffs 1 exchange rate elasticity also 1 2 25 move basket would offset us tariffs might well offset move weaker exchange rate also would reduce chinas imports even longrun elasticity bigger tariff needed depreciation counter tariffs probably less 10 especially chinese productivity traded sector increasing thus trend real appreciation chinas currency
nonetheless trying pull controlled depreciation risk outflows might put pressure domestic asset prices trying limit incentive move ahead expected depreciation might end limiting pbocs room cut interest rates
purely technical point view difficulty move makes interesting
currency choice china make also enormous global implications
personally would prefer china hold line
weaker currency could first step toward mix bigger chinese surplus even larger retreat existing trade rules parties around world try protect combination us tariffs chinese devaluation would also put additional pressure emerging economies struggling cope higher us rates runup oil prices
nonetheless increasingly expect china test far let currency move without triggering broad market political reaction
