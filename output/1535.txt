issue degree labor market slack us economy hot topic joe matthew business insider pushing debate forward see example important concern monetary policy general consensus fed sufficient slack continue justify extended period low interest rates hence rate hikes delayed mid late2015 even 2016 suggested chicago federal reserve president charles evans exists however considerable uncertainty amount slack labor markets feeling path rates currently expected policymakers assumes great deal slack consequence indications slack less expected tend move forward timing first rate hike perhaps pace subsequent tightening wage pressures likely early indicator slack diminishing
see two flavors uncertainty regarding amount excessive slack first question value unemployment rate signal tightness decline labor force participation rate clearly placed additional downward pressure unemployment leading speculation unemployment rate signaling tighter labor market exists reality scenario improving economy trigger flood entrants labor force provide additional slack thus unemployment rate underestimating degree slack
argument however becoming less day evidence seems mounting retirement dominant reason labor force exits since recession began consequently decline labor force participation persistent phenomenon fed think largely moved direction
next issue degree underemployment labor market dovish view underemployed longterm unemployed represent considerable slack
hawkish view cyclical problem structural one longterm unemployed theory simply lack currently needed skills countered indications discrimination longterm unemployed discrimination effectively means need job get job ability firms engage discrimination could viewed cyclical problem firms could stronger labor market
regarding underemployment see evidence structural explanation comparison reasons part time employment
employed part time clearly cyclical reasons falling employed part time could find full time work holding steady may skill set workers consistent current types full time jobs
doves point lackluster data jobs openings labor turnover jolts report support claim weak labor markets plenty slack numbers certainly impressive
said number unemployed job openings
view wage growth ultimately settle debate wage acceleration tends occur unemployment approaches 6 wage acceleration occur degree labor market slack remains high much longer established data hourly wages production nonsupervisory workers however appears indicate bubbling wage pressures
belief happening lower paid workers matter time happens higher paid workers well said open possibility limited improvement seeing may persist however issue think critical importance
c versus c indications tighter labor markets influence fed policy said past fed typically tightens policy ahead inflationary pressures practice meant hiking rates around time wage growth bottoms
time different well lets replace tightens policy reduces accommodation since fed would claim increase rates 1 tightening would describe reducing amount financial accommodation make policy less expansionary arguably describes happened fed began tapering discussion inflation expectations fell
higher real interest rates lower inflation expectations looks like less policy fed began make policy less accommodative context target inflation target unemployment unemployment fallen far enough felt necessary alter level accommodation prevent inflation pressures soon became evident wage growth bottomed coincidence probably words far federal reserve behaving would tightening cycle difference first step ending asset purchases rather raising interest rates
moreover seems clear evans rule tactic fed never foresaw instance would raise rates long unemployment 65 moreover clear tapering process inflation forecasts interest rate forecast never intention target inflation greater 25 extra 05 allowance forecast error assumption expected inflation would remain 2 always expected inflation would hit target never intended risk overshooting inflation
simply put fed began unwinding policy pretty much exactly would expect given behavior unemployment wage growth reasonable believe continue unwinding policy historically consistent manner substantial pause end asset purchases beginning rate hikes date first rate hike need moved forward theory
likely move date forward see less slack labor markets currently believe furthermore accelerating wage growth likely first conclusive evidence outcome hence focus wage growth suspect argue dont move forward date risk later
fed pursuing right policy allow wage rise reducing financial accommodation well would say already late could delay rate hikes would like see absent running labor market red hot pace dont see obvious way shift balance power labor reverse trend
said would also add last two cycles leave wary potential financial stability issues policy absence greater fiscal roll however left leaning monetary policy risking financial fallout
bottom line federal reserves policy path dependent particular view labor market suffering excessive slack continue problem long future reasonable expect evidence slack quickly expected trigger fresh assessment among policy makers regarding appropriate policy path next week probably soon later meetings likely given wages already appear rise c key sign tightening labor markets c change could happen quickly call higher rates warning higher rates might coming especially case fed wants avoid overshooting would argue actions date c signaling shift policy still missing parts dual mandate c suggest intention avoid overshooting similar previous cycles
