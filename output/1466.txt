back 1930s henry ford supposed remarked good thing americans didnt know banking really works revolution tomorrow morning
last week something remarkable happened bank england let cat bag paper called money creation modern economy coauthored three economists banks monetary analysis directorate stated outright common assumptions banking works simply wrong kind populist heterodox positions ordinarily associated groups occupy wall street correct effectively thrown entire theoretical basis austerity window
get sense radical banks new position consider conventional view continues basis respectable debate public policy people put money banks banks lend money interest c either consumers entrepreneurs willing invest profitable enterprise true fractional reserve system allow banks lend considerably hold reserve true savings dont suffice private banks seek borrow central bank
central bank print much money wishes also careful print much fact often told independent central banks exist first place governments could print money would surely put much resulting inflation would throw economy chaos institutions bank england us federal reserve created carefully regulate money supply prevent inflation forbidden directly fund government say buying treasury bonds instead fund private economic activity government merely taxes
understanding allows us continue talk money limited resource like bauxite petroleum say theres enough money fund social programmes speak immorality government debt public spending crowding private sector bank england admitted week none really true quote initial summary rather banks receiving deposits households save lending bank lending creates deposits normal times central bank fix amount money circulation central bank money multiplied loans deposits
words everything know wrong c backwards banks make loans create money money really iou role central bank preside legal order effectively grants banks exclusive right create certain kind ones government recognise legal tender willingness accept payment taxes theres really limit much banks could create provided find someone willing borrow never get caught short simple reason borrowers generally speaking take cash put mattresses ultimately money bank loans end back bank banking system whole every loan becomes another deposit whats insofar banks need acquire funds central bank borrow much like latter really set rate interest cost money quantity since beginning recession us british central banks reduced cost almost nothing fact quantitative easing theyve effectively pumping much money banks without producing inflationary effects
means real limit amount money circulation much central bank willing lend much government firms ordinary citizens willing borrow government spending main driver paper admit read carefully central bank fund government theres question public spending crowding private investment exactly opposite
bank england suddenly admit well one reason obviously true banks job actually run system late system running especially well possible decided maintaining fantasyland version economics proved convenient rich simply luxury longer afford
politically taking enormous risk consider might happen mortgage holders realised money bank lent really life savings thrifty pensioner something bank whisked existence possession magic wand public handed
historically bank england tended bellwether staking seeming radical positions ultimately become new thats whats happening might soon position learn henry ford right
