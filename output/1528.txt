officially department health human services says website cost 834 million thats number offered sylvia mathews burwell senate hearing may 8 2014
feb 28 2014 burwell told lawmakers center medicare medicaid services part hhs responsible website obligated total approximately 834 million information technology contracts interagency agreements
everyone taken figure face value bloomberg government undertook study used generous definition relevant federal spending study released september 2014 researchers included several additional costs beyond governments official estimate 387 million spending internal revenue service agencies beyond hhs well 300 million contract process paper applications additional spending hhs cutoff estimate
using broader net bloomberg government came figure 21 billion thats bigger official estimate still large trump said
asked bloomberg government studys author peter gosselin whether thought number could doubled 5 billion since study released 10 months ago skeptical saying even add fiveyear followup contract firm accenture get halfway 5 billion
trumps figure seems exaggerated however hunch came wrong easy see someone could made mistake
using provision affordable care act federal government spent nearly 5 billion series grants states establish health care exchanges according tabulations made congressional research service kaiser family foundation 5 billion statistic widely reported pops easily google searches
would seem suggest government spent 5 billion healthcaregov thats quite correct experts told politifact rather grants designed boost state efforts law federal site paid wide variety things websites including helping insurers prepare join exchanges offering assistance telephone hotlines establishing marketing outreach efforts potential beneficiaries hiring navigators help beneficiaries obtain care
gosselin jennifer tolbert director state health reform kaiser family foundation agreed would incorrect simply assume 5 billion health insurance exchange grants tantamount spending website way trump expressed
