policy makers desperately searching best methods measuring health strength labor market different data points even ones month month flashing confusing signals moment federal reserve preparing raise interest rates soon believe labor market strong enough deciding determine state important one fact everyone able agree official unemployment rate even attempt measure strength health labor market example open knowledge fed chair janet yellen looks dashboard least nine labor market indicators
official unemployment rate technically called u3 simply divides number people working want work actively applying jobs defined applied least two different employers within last month sum people working defined unemployed thus lots people unemployed many reasonable definitions count official government statistic using governments definition workers discouraged marginally attached labor market count official unemployment rate different broader unemployment measures available get headlines
particular unemployment rate back normal level 55 percent means labor market healthy strong wages start rising unemployment rate little state labor market rather need focus total potential supply workers including officially unemployed plus currently labor force government acronym nilf meaning people age 16 working trying gain work labor market might still quite weak little prospect higher wages
recent labor market trend rapidly rising number people labor force 90 million americans 16 years old older working fall several categories retirees stayathome parents students would prefer working given finding job government statistics poor job providing insight many labor force category policy makers reduced making educated guesses relative size subgroup working potential reenter labor market conditions improve
unemployment rate poor measure labor market strength better measure measures labor market churn job openings job leavings gross employment employment gain numbers much better measures health labor market
churn labor market focuses fact net gain jobs may averaging around 20000 per month fuller picture 45 5 million people leave jobs start new jobs every month data job openings hires separations make labor market churn government report known jolts actual changes employment month huge multiple net change employment generally speaking churn signals healthier labor market since gives much truer measure number available jobs point time churn labor market still large compared net changes jobs churn today lower used still returned prerecession levels
actual employment numbers speak directly strength labor market demand labor increasing workers working really pretty much simple currently six years end recession total us employment 1483 million compared prerecession peak level 1466 million meanwhile population working age people risen 175 million far 17 million person gain number people employed better economy employing people look changes employment rather changes unemployment see much less evidence strength labor market
labor force participation rate measures percentage eligible people either working officially unemployed meaning trying work changes labor force participation rate especially younger workers provide consumer perception labor market strength albeit confounded issues social familial safety net generosity labor market strong good highpaying jobs available people choose join labor force raising labor force participation rate labor force participation rate twenty year slide partially due rising share retirees population however since start last recession labor force participation rate dropped significantly recovered low participation rate clear sign weakness labor market truly strong labor market would attracting people join link shows labor force participation rate ages 2554 shows 2 percentage point drop since recession
parttime workers especially working parttime economic reasons tell something important labor market government provides data parttime workers two categories voluntarily want fulltime jobs get parttime hours businesses dont enough demand products make workers fulltime number parttime workers economic reasons rising labor market must weak number parttime workers economic reasons falling sign growing strength labor market parttime workers economic reasons falling still 2 million level start recession
unemployment really measure labor market disequilibrium measures mismatch employers demand labor various types workers willingness ability supply labor unemployment high low aggregate specific job categories really mismatches health labor market
10 million people reentered labor market 95 million found jobs unemployment rate would unchanged labor market characterized much healthier economy would much stronger similarly 10 million people reentered labor market applying two jobs none found jobs unemployment rate would rise 11 percent yet total employment would unchanged labor market would weaker would people officially unemployed
policy makers raise interest rates artificially low rates created distorting capital allocation punishing savers rewarding debtors incidentally including federal government raising interest rates reasonable pace unlikely affect labor market significantly however policy makers wish base interest rate decisions health labor market must look well beyond unemployment rate carefully one looks alternative measures weaker labor market looks fact likely explains financial markets seem rather convinced interest rate hikes loom horizon
