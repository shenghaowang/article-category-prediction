worth noting key things probably person entire single world like sex included literally fact life useless prohibiting humans procreating useless stop drinking guilty pleasures continue us wiped like dinosaurs still think unspoken golden rule sex airbnb room treat hosts house exactly would want guest treat home
general ive hosted past generally expect guests normal human things like breathing eating sleeping maybe even occasionally copulating specific reason fan hosting couples charge fee extra guests discourage practice sets tone im willing look way certain price however usually less issue im town renting entire place instead spare room former case tossing sheets wash wiping hands clean anything happened return
rules different dont whole place though personally get squeamish privacy know lots people view simply another place whatever please think pretty important keep mind youre staying someone elses homenot hostel hoteland adhere considerations mind treat consideration would roommate cases abstaining adults control urges keeping noise level stripping sheets later least thats assuming youve got private room sleeping type ofgod forbidshared room
though airbnb fundamentally business transaction almost experiences experience quite different staying hotel exchange extra savings youre staying someones house recognizing host lives entertains escapes hectic daily life spare time words someone elses home wildly different bunch twentysomethings going hostel dorm fact theres variety reasons prefer established businesses airbnb something else wouldnt want worrying expectations set even walk front door
said seem fair share people seem really want use airbnb place perform tantric sex bring someone back kinky night words guys
also necessarily respect hosts also respect guests might staying host well plenty airbnb hosts pretty much turned website fulltime type business legal ive certainly slept places privy happenings room next three four times night im going deny anyones right good time home im paying also right rest without constant interruption
youre traveling couple need evaluate purposes trip goal pure unadulterated adult fun honeymoon airbnb probably shouldnt list choices anyway unless involves staying chteau chances four five star hotel probably going fit style bit better first weekend getaway new beau going little bit different trip significant couple years together
im airbnb renter house rents room roomer fine assuming room door youre decently quietrespectful falls normal range far im concerned futon middle living room maybe great take longass shower together places bathroom awesome make big messy stains look like heirloomquality quilts bedding great basically id go would okay notokay longerterm roommate unless people really specific problem case would probably rent couples id presume okay long decently quiet clean
short nothing sex also depends attitude toward activity dont want hear side circus going room next door little different youre sex bed far im concerned anything goes
