crisis du jour bitcoin community yesterday collapse mt gox amid rumors hundreds millions dollars worth bitcoins stolen cynics claiming death cryptocurrency bitcoin backers rallying defense fact hysteria mt gox masks much deeper issues
bitcoin based several brilliant technological innovations possible innovations lead development software platform facilitates efficient financial transactions among businesses people breakthroughs plus excitement around bitcoin attracted many developers entrepreneurs considerable intellectual energy hard coding work going bitcoinbased technologies
unfortunately bitcoin many similar digital currencies two fatal design defects prevent succeeding cryptocurrencies want design flaws may also hinder broader deployment bitcoinbased technologies arent fixed
neither defect arose accident purposely hardwired bitcoin help ignite bitcoin payment system popularize protocols
bitcoin many derivative cryptocurrencies designed fixed supply currency time miners create currency inject system mining algorithms designed supply reaches asymptote c 21 million case bitcoin would different national currency system point time number dollars euros example fixed
fixed supply means bitcoin economy expands value bitcoins necessarily increases prices quoted currency decrease time c classic deflation deflation provides incentive people bitcoins hold use 10 bitcoins today buy car year would need 7 bitcoins say buy car many people reason way however bitcoins much value currency people wont using pay things
anyone taken macroeconomics knows deflation horrible phenomenon central bankers avoid like plague prospect deflation one scarier possibilities central bankers deal financial crisis see great article matthew brian atlantic bitcoin never currency two charts chart says shows think chart actually show effect speculation turn next
problem actually worse knew rate expansion bitcoin economy value asset value bitcoin would stable least market would calculate value bitcoin asset take account changes value flow services coming bitcoin presumably infinite life coins however expectations change lot result economic conditions thats one main reasons stock market rises falls value bitcoin would rising would fluctuating cyclically
course currency values fluctuate central banks typically step stabilize values variety tools try avoid deflation try keep inflation check even era floating exchange rates try minimize significant swings value currency
successful currencies around world stable currencies remember definition currency unit account store value medium exchange people dont want currency purposes fluctuates much people businesses countries unstable currencies gravitate towards highly stable dollar euro precisely reason likewise avoid unstable national currencies theres reason argentine peso hasnt caught
problems longrun equilibrium actually worse years building 21 million grand total mining algorithm clever build anything promote stability value currency path long run fixed supply
bitcoin advocates seem believe market figure asset value bitcoin settle matters problem view expected value bitcoins depends likely success currency also future economic conditions affect desire people want engage transactions value bitcoin fluctuates reason price houses common stock bonds longlived assets fluctuate people constantly changing views future like thats modern economies developed central banks economists actually think central banks guide money supply c us debate
result stability design defect bitcoin related currencies wont ever currencies currently designed never stability good currencies need therefore wont widely used units account stores value mediums exchange
bitcoin cant work around stability design defect
inventors bitcoin may created disruptive technologies first create private money theres reason efforts create private money havent gone anywhere might notice almost everyone gravitated c willingly c stable governmentsponsored currencies theres also reason dont transactions gold assets fixed supply way arguments arent currencies using bitcoinrelated technologies also tell us reward points currencies discussed days never take hold true currencies like bitcoin may future currency
stability design flaw wasnt oversight part bitcoin founders provide miners putting effort creating bitcoins people going transact bitcoins assurances bitcoins sponsors wouldnt devalue currency devaluation common problem currencies
back days currencies government mints would stamp currency less precious metal pay things modern times countries would inflating money supply imposing economists call inflation tax fixing supply bitcoin solved problem helped convince miners others bitcoins would retain value helped get system ignited cost limiting ability bitcoin become true currency
bitcoin wallet providers trying design around stability defect quickly convert bitcoins received merchants traditional currency thereby eliminating currency fluctuation risk merchant havent seen practice could also consumers deposit traditional currency convert bitcoin right time transaction way consumer wouldnt bear risk either
sides transaction done quickly enough eliminates risk buyer seller also admission bitcoin isnt currency since isnt used buyer seller true medium exchange exchanging another currency unit unit account prices really quoted whatever currency sent received even worse stability risk doesnt go away wallet provider bears risk pass cost buyer seller
ive discussed ignition c securing critical mass quickly c formidable problem faced payment system bitcoin founders get least three types players platform get ground needed miners motivated supply bitcoins buyers willing pay bitcoins sellers willing take bitcoins miners get paid bitcoins efforts c get transaction fees plus fixed amount bitcoins compensation structure also created community evangelists bitcoins way miners really got compensated mention founders bitcoin get buyers sellers board transacting otherwise bitcoins wouldnt value
bitcoin ecosystem therefore seeded group people financial incentives convince world something essentially worthless c bitcoin c actually valuable
cynical view different pyramid scheme start miners convince others bitcoin worth something buyers convince sellers worth something sellers get paid bitcoins need convince trading partners worth something price keeps rising result economists call greater fool theory buyer willing pay asset simply expectation another buyer pay even expectations fragile eventually pyramid schemes collapse bubbles burst enough people catch game
dont need cynic however see theres problem bubbles also result behavioral economists call confirmation bias people want believe therefore accept information confirms beliefs ignore information contrary beliefs miners holders bitcoins want believe something valuable evidence wealth lower beliefs wrong unwelcome news phenomenon different homeowners lenders financial crisis refused accept evidence fundamentals couldnt possibly support values placed housing stock
bitcoin community seems lot confirmation bias going countries ban bitcoin massive thefts hackers bitcoins bitcoin foundation directors get arrested bitcoin prices nosedive largest exchange collapse economists stripes question whether could seems shake belief bitcoin advocates teflon currency
cryptocurrencies lot true believers example one largest bitcoin exchanges mt gox shuts leading first bank run bitcoin financial system one author sees three silver linings collapse concludes even hopeful end digital currency instead beginning another report concluded bitcoins recent price decline wake ongoing operational issues major bitcoin exchanges actually sign ecosystem stabilizing
happy talk bit like investment banker september 15 2008 seeing collapse lehman brothers harbinger good times ahead dick bennett insisting fox news late election eve face massive data contrary mitt romney really still going win presidency experience confirmation bias isolated example reaction community common bitcoin media course financial stake success cryptocurrencies miners
easy though see people reason way c people dont like admit mistakes really dont want news assets worth lot less really bitcoin followers human operating ecosystem designed intentionally bubbly c like champagne
fact lot evidence much activity involving bitcoin involves speculation matthew brian wrote atlantic bitcoin never currency two charts researchers found 64 percent bitcoins accounts never used ones used arent used value driven demand use bitcoin transactions purchased people speculating value rise speculative bubble one manifestation stability design defect discussed david nyu stern school business recently found article bitcoin real currency zero correlation fluctuations value bitcoin value currencies also finds bitcoin 10 times volatile currencies including gold
serious defects necessarily fatal
neither defects necessarily fatal eventual success digital currencies sadly far obvious fix way still makes possible ignite platform someone someday may figure though moreover technological innovations developed bitcoin could still significant influence future financial services industries
might need patient took century babbage invented mechanical computer mid 19th century companies actually able use computers decades birth internet actually relevant regular people businesses recent twitter exchange marc andreesen suggests maybe long game investors like mind
yep protocol first foremost andreesen said exchange protocols take longer establish cement standalone systems far powerful long run
fifty years maybe hundred might look back see cryptocurrency mania early 2010s seeds new financial services industry bitcoin might get filed tulips famous bubbles c worse famous pyramid schemes c days gone
ill lot say topic bitcoin debate innovation project 2014 march 19th youd like ringside seat request invite
