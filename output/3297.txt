pending dc district court fairholme fund already discovery dc court federal claims cases federal national mortgage assctn fnni otcbbfnma fannie mae otcbbfnma
read motion mortgage assctn fnni otcbbfnma fannie mae really quite stunning ive gone ahead marked make easier
fhfa produced 4300 pages 25 previously public admit keep administrative record actions unfathomable govt agency dealing issues dealing kept
throw every argument fact along give judge reason permit discovery
releasing 25 previously non public documents laughable record treasury better releasing 205 4200 pages previously still pathetic
slap face entire process proof either govt assumes win hell lot hide guess little
entire case govt still boils said could case thrown absurd
plaintiffs claim fhfa treasury worked together placing bet worth sweep place thus fhfa breached fiduciary duty thus sweep invalid boiled simple
govt response produced documentation back claim anything check produced one affidavit mr council fhfa states action taken fhfa entirely appropriate issue affidavit dated two month suit useless best
fannie mae c fully expect fairholme victorious
