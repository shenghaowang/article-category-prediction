scotland edinburgh particular world class financial services industry banking insurance fund management
question posed todays scotland analysis paper treasury whether scotland separated rest uk would able retain bigger banks part industry
something concern two largest scottish banks royal bank scotland rbs bank scotland bank scotlands owner lloyds banking group registered office edinburgh therefore seen scottish entirety although top management based london head office
directors banks talk public fears dont want seen influencing highly charged debate scotlands future
problem described senior scottish banker big bank domicile home independent scotland might seen much riskier borrower equivalent bank based uk would therefore become much expensive bank borrow raise vital finance
view said banker moment looked though scotland win independence funding costs would rise significantly rbs lloyds would move homes city london
banker right say views held bankers spoken many months doesnt mean correct worth arguments
basically two reasons rbs lloyds might viewed lend altogether riskier proposition scotland separated rest uk
first big relative size british economy enormous proportion scottish economy
example assets loans investments british banks relative size british gdp around 500
many would say shows britains banking industry way big health stability british economy
means arguably another systemic crisis banks time soon costs saving banks second time would unaffordable taxpayers bankrupt banks would bankrupt state
officials andy haldane bank england beginning ask whether big missing part banking reform recent years absence attempt curtail size banks
haldane right size matters bad way implications independent scotland would troubling indeed nominal sense scottish banking assets equivalent 1250 scottish gdp
rbs according latest published balance sheet loans investments equivalent eight times scottish gdp
treasurys paper says bailout provided uk authorities rbs crisis 2008 would equivalent 211 scotlands gdp suggests independent scotland things equal would able afford bail rbs
probably worth pointing juncture alex salmond scotlands first minister proponent scottish independence supported rbss takeover 2007 bulk abn amro deal massively increased rbss size
would say quite tricky mr salmond argue things would equal autonomous scotland
anyway point investors companies lend bank invest look would happen bank went pearshaped said bank got serious financial mess
look whether government country home bank would bail bank crisis thus reducing losses banks creditors whether relevant government could practice afford bail bank
point lend rbs would note uk government practice able afford bail
would considerable doubts whether government independent scotland would deep enough pockets
scotland become independent things equal words might either refuse lend rbs charge expensive interest rates
circumstances rbs would pack bags move london
also strain government finances bailing bank would concern creditors rbs lloyds
would even pressing concern would banks access emergency liquidity emergency loans commercial sources money dry
great triggers global banking crisis 2012 eurozone banking crisis providers credit banks went strike central banks step loans
bank headquarters scotland would need certainty central bank could turn money markets freeze central bank would lender last resort
thing bank england would prepared act provider loans scottish banks crisis charge regulating supervising banks present
bank england could risk viability british taxpayers money supporting banks could boss around supervisory sense
put another way whether rbs lloyds could continue scottish banks bound separate hugely important debate whether scotland would part formal sterling zone bank england central bank separated scotland
scotland formal part sterling zone bank england hm treasury would wish impose constraints financial risks scotlands banks could take limit liabilities british taxpayers
could yet another reason scottish banks might wish move london bank england would judge sustainability therefore magnitude risks could take basis british governments resources rather scottish governments
couple things follow necessary conditions rbs lloyds remain headquartered independent scotland assumption independent scotland would view jobs associated banks home worth risks underwriting banks liabilities
first investors notorious mr market would impose limits scope scottish independence wishes remain domicile big banks
precisely mr market saying eurozones governments wish currency union survive namely pool financial resources cede degree autonomous control taxing spending save euro
second british government successful reducing innate british banks size easier would scotland secede keep big banks
