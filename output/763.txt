looming prospect expanded use unmanned aerial vehicles colloquially known drones raised understandable concerns concerns led call legislation mandating nearly uses drones prohibited unless government first obtained warrant privacy advocates mounted lobbying campaign succeeded convincing thirteen states enact laws regulating use drones law enforcement eleven thirteen states requiring warrant government may use campaigns mounted privacy advocates oftentimes make compelling case threat pervasive surveillance legislation rarely tailored way prevent harm advocates fear fact every state legislation passed new laws focused technology drones harm pervasive surveillance many cases technology centric approach creates perverse results allowing use extremely sophisticated pervasive surveillance technologies manned aircraft disallowing benign uses drones mundane tasks like accident crime scene documentation monitoring industrial pollution environmental harms
first dronerelated legislation appeared 2013 florida idaho montana oregon north carolina tennessee virginia 2014 wisconsin illinois indiana utah iowa also passed laws seeking address use drones law writing paper california legislature passed dronerelated bill vetoed governor bills sponsors vowed revisit issue next legislative legislative efforts aimed restricting governments use drone technology largely allowing government conduct identical surveillance using drone technology absurd anachronism intentional privacy advocates explicitly chosen capitalize public interest attention associated demonization drone technology way achieve legislative victories advocates admittedly focused sensible legislation addresses harms irrespective technology
counter threat surveillance privacy advocates focused solely requiring warrants use drones law enforcement mandate oftentimes result grounding drone technology circumstances law enforcement use drones would beneficial largely noncontroversial example light boston marathon bombing police may want fly drone marathon ensure safety public many bills police would allowed use drone unless warrant premised upon probable cause believe crime committed requirement exceeds current fourth amendment protections regard reasonableness observing activities public places means police would need put together warrant application sufficient facts prove judge probable cause application would need define particularity place searched persons would required observe people gathered public place merely observation taking place drone rather officer rooftop helicopter circumstance like marathon probable cause showing difficult police satisfy police knew crowd potential bomber would arrest individuals rather marathon type event police would want use drone monitor unknown attackers unfortunate event attack use footage identify perpetrators precisely type circumstance use drone could helpful unfortunately outlawed many states make matters worse type drone surveillance would pose little harms privacy marathon highly public event event televised takes place streets surveillance cameras spectators photographing event moreover states drones banned unless accompanied warrant police prohibited using type surveillance equipment Âª drones technology centric approach done little protect privacy certainly harm public safety depriving law enforcement tool could use protect people

aerial observations curtilage home generally prohibited fourth amendment long government conducting surveillance public navigable airspace intrusive manner government conduct reveal intimate activities traditionally associated use home us supreme court addressed issue aerial surveillance series cases late
california v supreme court held fourth amendment violated aerial observation respondents backyard ciraolo police received tip someone growing marijuana backyard ciraolos home police officer attempted observe growing observations obscured six foot high outer fence ten foot high inner fence officer suspicious fences might intended hide growth marijuana obtained private plane flew backyard ciraolos property altitude 100 feet altitude within faas definition public navigable airspace supreme court found search therefore prohibited fourth amendment finding chief justice burger stated erecting 10 foot fence ciraolo manifested subjective intent desire maintain privacy unlawful agriculture intent desire amount expectation privacy court noted fence might shield plants eyes citizen policeman perched top truck accordingly entirely clear whether ciraolo maintained subjective expectation privacy observations backyard ground level court believed unreasonable ciraolo expect privacy backyard routine overflight observation power company repair mechanic pole overlooking yard would reveal exactly police discovered
time ciraolo decided court held dow chemical co v united states use aerial mapping camera photograph industrial manufacturing complex navigable airspace similarly require warrant fourth amendment
dow chemical co supreme court acknowledge use technology might change courts inquiry stating surveillance private property using highly sophisticated surveillance equipment generally available public satellite technology might constitutionally proscribed absent warrant court dismissed notion stating person airplane aerial camera could readily duplicate photographs issue short court stated taking aerial photographs industrial plant complex navigable airspace search prohibited fourth amendment
ciraolo court articulated similar theme noting defendant reasonable expectation privacy backyard despite erected fences obscure yard view court reasoned defendant shielded yard view street observations truck twolevel bus might allowed person see yard continuing court stated fourth amendment protection home never extended require law enforcement officers shield eyes passing home public thoroughfares despite defendants fence court said mere fact individual taken measures restrict views activities preclude officers observations public vantage point right renders activities clearly visible police flew small commercial airplane ciraolos land public navigable airspace physically nonintrusive manner therefore defendant may expected privacy backyard privacy aerial viewing one society prepared deem reasonable court stated age private commercial flight public airways routine unreasonable respondent expect marijuana plants constitutionally protected observed naked eye altitude 100 feet
shortly ciraolo dow chemical co supreme court analyzed use helicopters aerial surveillance florida v riley supreme court held fourth amendment require police traveling public airways altitude 400 feet obtain warrant order observe visible naked riley court found rule ciraolo controlled riley like ciraolo took measures protected ground level observation sides roof greenhouse left partially open sky ciraolos yard allowed one look directly yard riley police flew helicopter rileys land observed marijuana plants growing rileys greenhouse
court riley found growing greenhouse subject viewing air police conduct riley acceptable police flying publicly navigable airspace intimate details connected use home curtilage observed undue noise wind dust threat injury court continued member public could legally flying rileys property helicopter altitude 400 feet could observed rileys greenhouse police officer important passage concurring judgment justice oconnor noted public use altitudes lower 400 public observations helicopters circling curtilage sufficiently rare police surveillance altitudes would violate reasonable expectations privacy despite compliance faa air safety regulations
thus law least last 25 years allowed police fly aircraft private property backyards factory farms industrial plants place average citizen may fly cessna police may make observations air like person commercial flight inbound airport look observe yards people like utility worker pole look adjacent yard armed information police use get warrant go foot investigate previously observed lawful vantage point without warrant two decades police required turn blind eye evidence criminality merely observed air similarly required ignore evidence criminality merely witness crime eyes drone
prior section indicated supreme courts aerial surveillance jurisprudence makes reference public navigable airspace observations public vantage point officer right tying fourth amendments protections location airspace surveillance conducted supreme court left open possibility low altitude surveillance may violate fourth amendment importantly drones law enforcement likely acquire operate effective altitudes 500 feet thus drones poised disrupt settled fourth amendment jurisprudence operating airspace heretofore subject case law statutes
understand emergent legal issue necessary understand unsettled nature landowners rights lowaltitude airspace 1946 case united states v causby supreme court analyzed airspace rights causby case involved chicken farmers whose farm adjacent small municipal airport us military began using world war military flights low 83 feet land 67 feet causbys home causbys chickens would frightened overflight fly wall chicken coop causbys sued federal government claiming governments flights constituted fifth amendment
supreme courts opinion authored justice william douglas began analyzing ad doctrine roots common law jurisprudence dating back centuries cino da declaration est solum est usque ad coelum translated means soil belongs owns also doctrine assigned airspace rights based ownership surface land situated immediately held extended indefinitely outer reaches justice douglas analyzing ad coelum doctrine quickly dispensed stating place modern rather douglas said landowner owned least much space ground occupy use connection government party intrudes space intrusions treated category invasions invasions could right circumstances treated trespass facts presented causby flights could considered taking facts causby importantly involved flights low frequent direct immediate interference enjoyment use land causby opinion thus created two types airspace public navigable airspace public highway landowner could exclude aircraft flying airspace extends downward surface landowners held right exclude aircraft
discussion brings focus possibility landowner may exclude others entering low altitude airspace property may exclude drones whether government civilian operated entering airspace rights fact exist altitude property rights triggered unfortunately little clarity point supreme court referred airspace immediate reaches land intrusions would subtract owners full enjoyment
graphic illustrates complexities associated jurisprudence regulations governing aerial surveillance airspace rights faa regulations create minimum altitude 500 100 feet areas exempting helicopters minimums certain circumstances regulations also create maximum altitude 400 feet model aircraft would include drones supreme court ciraolo approved aerial surveillance manned aircraft flying 100 feet riley approved aerial surveillance helicopter 400 feet however causby supreme court said flights 83 feet taking airport violated causbys property rights average two story home 35 feet tall question mark depicts gray area paper argues must clarified
lack clarity presents significant issue law public policy drones likely operated law enforcement citizens small planes helicopters effective used navigable airspace say 500 feet although 500 feet rough rule consider supreme courts opinion california v ciraolo central courts holding notion government surveillance 100 feet ground took place public vantage point police officer right officer ciraolo conduct surveillance today drone would likely fly drone 100 feet fact would likely fly high enough landowners property look observe marijuana plants likely 40 feet altitude would flight violate landowners reasonable expectation privacy would largely depend obscured land observations altitude would also require landowner right exclude drone flying property course exclusionary right would prevent officer flying drone public land street circumstance officer would need stand sidewalk fly drone altitude high enough see landowners property whether low altitude aerial observation public land peering private property would considered public vantage point therefore acceptable fourth amendment perspective similarly open
riley plurality said case controlled concurring opinion justice oconnor highlighted problems riley extension ciraolo courts opinion wrote
analyzing passage professor troy rule notes twentyfive years riley law enforcement agencies easily purchase hypothetical miraculous tool oconnor clear devices easily purchased least yet small drones police likely purchase today cannot operate without creating noise incapable seeing books people reading interestingly justice oconnor discussing manned aircraft manned aircraft fact possess capabilities feared yet witnessed proposals seeking ban use high powered cameras mounted helicopters given lack interest banning capabilities manned aircraft difficult see banning drones yet possess capabilities rational policy choice nevertheless engineers continue increase lift capacity drones superior technology already mounted manned aircraft drones may eventually possess capabilities justice oconnor feared point may prudent legislate eye towards controlling observations irrespective whether drone manned platform
important future observational capabilities though locational capabilities drones currently possess namely ability hover enclosed courtyard lower altitudes drones lawenforcement agencies likely acquire become highly problematic thus question exactly publicly navigable airspace become increasingly critical resolving deal aerial surveillance state local governments need wait faa define areas fact zoning laws state local governments clearly define rights landowners airspace land answer many open questions regarding public vantage points
section divided two parts first part series five core recommendations adopted address public private harms associated drones balancing rights private parties needs law enforcement second part consists series principles legislators remain cognizant choose forgo core recommendations follow problematic warrantbased approach advanced advocacy groups
legislators follow property rights approach aerial surveillance explicitly extending property owners rights airspace 350 feet ground level approach may solve public private harms associated drones allowing landowner exclude intrusions airspace government private parties
uncertainty associated landowner rights airspace immediately property raised two problems first little clarity regarding low altitude aerial surveillance government would violate fourth amendment 500 feet fixed wing aircraft 100 400 feet helicopter riley court said surveillance conducted 400 feet helicopter require warrant left open possibility surveillance lower altitude would acceptable thus raising question flight 350 feet case law whether would lawful observation clear difficult see court applying principles riley would find substantive differences observation 350 feet versus one 400 feet thats supreme courts jurisprudence tells us look whether observation took place navigable airspace vantage point member public could otherwise helicopters navigable airspace could easily include 350 feet ground level long pilot creating drones model aircraft faa rules guidelines hobbyists require operation 400 feet thus operation 350 feet would public vantage point problem technology problem ability landowners exclude aerial observations certain vantage points thats property rights problem legislative solution aerial surveillance must address issue second absence clarity regard property rights also raised concerns privacy implications private nongovernment uses drones private drone use beyond scope paper right exclude government conducting aerial surveillance inextricably tied whether public would right make observation police made linkage two concepts suggests property rights approach may provide way harmonize separate policy concerns also address concerns associated aerial surveillance
property law almost exclusively governed state local laws arizona state law professor troy first scholars analyze property rights context notes unlike murky set legal rules governing low altitude airspace laws delineating property rights surface land could hardly land professor rule explains owned owners rights exclude trespassers intruders however commons regime governs highaltitude airspace many ways antithesis private property regime applies surface land one owns highaltitude space everyone welcome use follow certain land high altitude airspace area murky largely undefined state local governments act clarify rights landowners zone land high altitude
state local governments act craft laws clarifying property rights low altitude airspace could arguing merely codifying long standing property law doctrine state local governments could rely causby courts declaration flight airplanes skim surface touch much appropriation use land conventional entry upon flights category invasions
low altitude flights immediately landowners property akin walking onto property police fly drones low altitude landowners property observe backyard persons home engaged conduct akin walking onto property fourth amendment analysis would require analyzing whether landowner could excluded public making observation vantage point ie flight take place area public right thus control low altitude flights legislators need craft statutes provide property owners right exclude members public low altitude airspace
granted rule extending property rights manner prevent low altitude flights directly landowners property wont preclude police asking neighbor fly adjacent property obtain better vantage point like existing rules dont preclude police private citizen asking neighbor come inside look second floor window neighboring property similarly rule wont preclude police flying public land sidewalks streets local zoning laws could address flights public land proposed approach preclude police flying low altitudes directly greenhouse like one riley directly backyard like ciraolo would preserve ability police conduct already lawful surveillance activities near altitudes conducted riley 400 feet ciraolo 100 feet approach would also secondary effect making low altitude paparazzi drone flights unlawful flown example directly kim kardashian kanye wests
legislators follow property rights approach aerial surveillance approach provides landowners right exclude aircraft persons objects column airspace extending surface land 350 feet ground level agl
might statute look like preserve privacy landowners right must extend high enough make exclusion effective however preserve right transit amazon google delivery drone mapping real estate drone model aircraft right exclusion cannot extend way navigable airspace line 500 feet locations 100 feet congested appropriate statute would thus state landowners airspace property 350 feet ground level locations provide landowner airspace rights extend ten times height average two story home virtue owning column land 350 feet landowner right exclude general public therefore police flying property way interfere enjoyment land proposal draws line 350 feet navigable airspace generally understood existing minimum altitude 500 feet faa promulgated regulations guidance allow use model aircraft includes drones altitudes maximum 400 feet thus leaving 100 foot buffer space model aircraft operations navigable setting landowners airspace 350 feet provides 50 foot buffer space ceiling property owners airspace ceiling model aircraft airspace allowing small transit zone model aircraft transit zone may allow model aircraft operators traverse airspace private property without fear violating landowners property rights simultaneously avoiding violating faa regulations
proposal creates 350 feet upwards navigable airspace buffer zone drones aircraft fly established limit 350 foot ceiling landowners airspace floor publicly navigable airspace 500 100 feet drones could otherwise operate transit landowners property en route delivering goods also means drones could even operate space take photographs conduct surveillance surveillance may first blush seem problematic proposal fact nearly status quo solution riley warrantless helicopter observation 400 feet deemed constitutional court leaving open possibility observations lower altitudes might also constitutional thus proposal provides greater protections riley providing greater precision proposal creates bright line rule 350 feet making clear aerial intrusion altitude would violate landowners property rights therefore would nonpublic vantage point thus drones helicopters might still conduct surveillance 350 feet drone surveillance altitude far less intrusive helicopter surveillance 400 feet helicopters larger size enables carry far sophisticated surveillance equipment concomitantly observations drones 350 feet far less intrusive observations helicopters flying
image shows commercially available 1300 drone equipped hd camera sees 350 feet altitude red arrow points drone operator drones carry cameras zoom lens capabilities however systems expensive larger louder systems also universally less capable manned aircraft carry heavier sophisticated surveillance equipment photo credit npr
defining property rights manner extending 350 feet allow courts readily adjudicate claims aerial observation violated fourth amendment courts inquiry whether officer right place made observation whether police observation public vantage point turn question police observation take place vantage point violates landowners right exclude answer question court need look statute facts associated observation drones readily discernible law enforcement drones carry sophisticated gps software pinpoints location salutary effect approach civil suits unlawful operation drones landowners property onlookers adjudicated reference clearly defined property rights allowing courts evaluate trespass
proposal intended ban aerial surveillance rather intended place aerial surveillance drones manned aircraft equal legal footing sense status quo solution technology neutral proposal also ensures policymakers remain focused harms aerial surveillance platform thus future law enforcement agencies begin using blimps also known manned aircraft equipped sophisticated cameras drones manner appreciably increases current amount aerial surveillance policymakers address new harms rather focusing merely drones
legislators craft simple duration based surveillance legislation addresses potential persistent surveillance
address concern property based approach allow drones aircraft sit buffer airspace property owners airspace publicly navigable airspace legislators focus controlling duration surveillance limit two feared harms first duration based limits aerial surveillance address possibility drones technologies enable police follow individuals monitor day day activities second duration based limits address possibility drones aircraft used hover directly landowners property lengthy periods time monitoring individuals day day activities two forms persistent surveillance conducted manned unmanned aircraft therefore legislators take technology neutral approach problem placing limits duration surveillance rather platform surveillance conducted
crafting legislation places aggregate limits long law enforcement may surveil specific persons places protect possibility persistent surveillance example
surveillance person may continue 60 minutes officers discretion
minute 48 hour surveillance may take place court order reasonable suspicion
surveillance longer 48 hours permissible accompanied warrant probable
specific amount time legislators may settle period aggregation depend whether jurisdiction wants value privacy law enforcement efficiency note focus surveillance specific person surveillance widespread areas occurring legislators may want lengthier limits example limiting aerial surveillance 60 minutes unless accompanied warrant would mean law enforcement could monitor specific events boston marathon limitation likely desired policy outcome legislators careful craft limitations way address harm persistent surveillance tracking individuals versus public safety area surveillance event based surveillance
irrespective time chosen point carefully crafting duration based rules surveillance whether drone manned aircraft otherwise better approach current drone focused approach oftentimes riddled blanket bans rather crafting special exceptions legislating eye towards persistent surveillance rules based clearly defined limits creates public policy clearer easier follow easier courts adjudicate doesnt allow loopholes based technology
adopt data retention procedures require heightened levels suspicion increased procedural protections accessing data time passes
many critics drones raise legitimate concern governments collection aerial imagery video enable pervasive surveillance allows government know citizens points time even allow government officials review footage years collection revealing intimate details persons life problem unique drones rather recurring theme critiques video still imagery collection legislators adopt policies address collection retention information way focuses information collected stored accessed rather particular technology used collect information thus section speaks specifically drones principles articulated apply forms video imagery collection
protect pervasive surveillance warehousing data citizens legislators enact retention policies procedures make difficult government access information time passes eventually information collected government destroyed end predetermined period time specific duration time processes may subject debate procedures timelines legislatively determined therefore cannot modified individual agencies protect rights individuals information gathered stored exempt sunshine act requests fully discoverable criminal prosecution process items form bulk responsible retention procedure
moment collection 30 days collection information treated like contemporaneous near contemporaneous observation agents government able monitor aerial surveillance real time near real time observe real time near real time 30 day window allow law enforcement respond immediate nearly immediate complaints violations law
30 days passed initial collection information collected aerial surveillance moved servers openly accessible law enforcement servers accessible court order showing reasonable suspicion
90 days passed initial collection police allowed access information stored servers without court order showing probable cause indicates information contained servers contains evidence crime
information stored servers automatically deleted period time government maintain long term archive information individuals period time may short 120 days longer five years
legislators adopt transparency accountability measures requiring government agencies publish regular basis information sue aerial surveillance devices manned unmanned
transparency accountability measures required regardless whether legislators follow core recommendations warrantbased principles part b transparency accountability measures may effective suppression rules warrants controlling deterring wrongful government surveillance hold law enforcement accountable legislators mandate use aerial surveillance devices manned unmanned published regular basis perhaps quarterly website agency operating system
usage logs detail operated system operated operated including gps coordinates law enforcement purpose operation legislators may even mandate unmanned systems operated jurisdictions come equipped software allows easy export flight logs contain information logs allow privacy advocates concerned citizens closely monitor aerial surveillance devices used enabling political process mechanism hold operators accountable
circumstances publishing usage logs may reveal information law enforcement sensitive ongoing investigation agency operating drone may keep usage logs confidential investigation closed agency required make logs public within 30 days close investigation facilitate public accountability legislators mandate logs published open machinereadable format consistent presidents executive order may 9
evidence flight log approach works one need look across atlantic united kingdom many police departments publish helicopter flight logs webpage fact even live tweet helicopters activities law within united kingdom specifically requires police departments law enforcement agencies publish flight logs helicopters version freedom information act appears legislative authority prompting publication police helicopter logs
like united states number public watchdog groups united kingdom monitor police activity including groups whose sole purpose monitor activity related noise complaints police groups respective websites act forum noise privacy complaints various individuals across kingdom several groups organize lobby members parliament mps pass legislation restricting helicopter groups advocacy generate appear largely responsible recent trend many uk police departments publishing helicopters flight logs even creating twitter accounts helicopters publish realtime updates aircrafts
helicopter twitter accounts become growing trend amongst british police departments immediate powerful effect public relations respective jurisdictions islington police department went struggling handle overload noise complaints relating departments use helicopter receiving complaints creation helicopter twitter twitter account gained 700 followers first weeks public criticism police helicopter activity ceased entirely department reflected well future twitter feed issuing statement
suffolk police department launched twitter feed hope shedding light police practices roger lewis observer suffolk police described departments intentions following way
difficult see practice disclosing flight logs public department web page useful tool reassuring public law helicopter represent big brothers eye sky rather embodies part departments lawful policing practices police helicopter high overhead ominous ground unaware purposes idea american cities towns might foreboding many lay persons requiring law enforcement publish data logs legislators add political check help quell fears society yet certain react increasing presence aerial surveillance devices skies america
recognize technology geofencing autoredaction may make aerial surveillance drones protective privacy human surveillance
technology continues evolve rapid pace possible drones aerial surveillance technologies may enable targeted surveillance protects privacy still allowing collection evidence technology goal privacy using geofencing technology collect evidence specific locations using redaction programming automatically obscure information point collection creative legislators embrace technology writing laws requiring aerial surveillance devices systems protect privacy
example imagine police receive tip marijuana growing backyard 123 main street dispatch helicopter gather aerial photographs 123 main street property altitude 700 feet police overhead photographing 123 main street look see woman sunbathing adjacent property 125 main street inadvertent observation woman 125 main street violate fourth amendment rights may nevertheless viewed perspective offensive intrusion violates personal expectation privacy even one society per courts willing deem reasonable imagine collection scenario time conducted drone camera manned helicopter software programmed protect privacy prior mission aircraft would instructed document activities ongoing 123 main street software could required automatically additional information gathered adjoining properties 125 main street home hypothetical sunbather furthermore legislators could also require software automatically blur faces individuals faces revealed upon adequate showing either reasonable suspicion probable cause particular standard determined legislature believe individual involved criminal activity state local government required aircraft engaged aerial surveillance coded privacy rights adjacent sunbather inadvertently observed individuals would protected policies mandated society may evolve point drones mandated manned flights might place law enforcement officers situation might tempted make unwanted observations innocent people thus drones may someday protective privacy manned aircraft
legislators choose ignore core principles approach articulated following recommendations intended provide legislators principles guide policymaking problematic warrantbased approach drones aerial surveillance
legislators reject calls blanket requirement drone use accompanied warrant
legislators forgo property rights approach detailed part eschew proposals require warrants use drones prohibitions overbroad legislation requires warrants drones treats information drone differently information gathered manned aircraft differently gathered police officer patrol car even officer foot patrol current fourth amendment jurisprudence police required shield eyes wrongdoing warrant impose requirement collection information drones
much antidrone activists efforts aimed threat persistent pervasive surveillance population government understandable fear unreasonable fear work way legislation ban ordinary aerial observations controversial take place remote controlled helicopter rather manned one anybody cessna see pollution pouring factory police flying helicopter see cartels drug operations human trafficking ring Âª observations admitted evidence criminal trial shouldnt citizens police able make observations expect evidence wont excluded merely collected remote control aircraft
example imagine police officer patrol patrol car driving witnesses car front strike pedestrian speed witnessing crime probable cause predicate level suspicion warrant even reasonable suspicion predicate level suspicion brief investigatory stop believe vehicle front would involved crime lets assume dash camera recorded entire incident nonetheless dashcam video may used evidence driver subsequent criminal proceeding however broadly worded proposals introduced many state legislatures us congress piece evidence gathered drone would inadmissible court police warrant
examples raise questions public policy goals advanced suppression evidence crime documented drone evidence recorded dashcam observed airplane viewed neighboring home would admissible court examples highlight requiring warrants evidence gathered drones methods gathering evidence would require warrant
jurisdictions enacted limitations information gathered drones may used legislators reject broadly worded use restrictions prohibit use evidence gathered drones nearly proceeding restrictions exceed parameters fourth amendment circumstances may serve protect criminals deterring governmental wrongdoing
example alameda county california sheriffs department proposed use small drones crime scene documentation eod missions hazmat response search rescue public safety life preservation missions disaster response fire prevention documentation felony documentation premised upon probable linda lyle privacy advocate aclu criticized proposal stating sheriff wants drone search rescue policy say use search policy deploy drone search rescue use data untold purposes huge loophole exception swallows points mirror aclus position december 2011 white paper state drone use acceptable long surveillance used secondary law enforcement also similar language used proposals prohibiting use information gathered drone evidence individual trial hearing
simple hypothetical help illustrate problem approach imagine law enforcement uses drone search lost hiker state park search rescue mission fits within public safety emergency exceptions legislative proposals aimed controlling drone usage however imagine course search drone observed man stabbing woman death park collection entirely inadvertent suppressing videotape stabbing would serve deter police using drones future searching unrelated stabbing crime searching lost hiker yet evidence blanket use restrictions found various proposals circulating state legislatures congress aclus secondary law enforcement purposes standard would need
suppressing secondarily gathered evidence doesnt protect privacy inadvertent discovery cant deterred merely protects criminal observed helicopter airplane ground would face evidence crime broadly worded drone focused privacy bills may difficult prosecute difficult see public policy goal furthered suppressing evidence crime merely evidence gathered drone instead helicopter legislators really want position making harder punish perpetrators violent crime discovery genuinely inadvertent little deterrent value justifies suppressing evidence
legislators choose impose warrant requirement codify existing exceptions
legislators seek impose statutory warrant requirement use drones codify exceptions warrant requirement exclusionary rule courts developed decades jurisprudence codification could either state existing exceptions warrant requirement apply statutory requirement warrant statute could enumerate exceptions apply
supreme court noted suppressing evidence serious consequences truthseeking law enforcement objectives criminal justice system present high obstacle urging last resort first measure apply exclusionary rule whether drone used rather benefits exceptions procedural devices legislators consider codifying
rather codify blanket restriction use information gathered drone legislators codify standing requirement premises ones ability raise suppression challenge whether person raising suppression claim purported target drone surveillance thus law enforcement uses drone document illegal dumping toxic waste coconspirator 1 coconspirator 2s privacy rights violated 2 ability vicariously assert privacy rights protect prosecution
evidence gathered drones admissible proceedings short trial grand jury preliminary bail proceedings
evidence gathered drones admissible impeachment purposes little deterrent value keeping impeachment evidence trial law enforcement unlikely gather solely purpose use evidence gathered drones limited purpose furthers truthseeking process deters
legislators impose statutory warrant requirement use drones also codify directly reference body jurisprudence associated socalled good faith exception articulated united states v massachusetts v good faith exception allows admission evidence gathered pursuant defective warrant unless based objective facts reasonably well trained officer would known search illegal despite magistrates authorization
legislators make clear independent source doctrine articulated murray v united states applies equally drone related independent source doctrine allows admission evidence despite police illegality evidence seized causally linked illegal police conduct
legislators codify inevitable discovery rule articulated nix v context drone surveillance rule would operate allow admission drone gathered evidence criminal trial prosecutor prove preponderance evidence evidence would ultimately inevitably discovered lawful
rather suppress fruit drone surveillance legislators codify attenuation principles articulated wong court wong sun stated considering whether fruit unlawful search suppressed court must ask whether granting establishment primary illegality evidence instant objection made come exploitation illegality instead means sufficiently distinguishable purged primary taint stated differently point fruit poisonous tree loses potency factors legislators consider codifying 1 passage time illegal search acquisition evidence 2 intervening events lack illegal drone surveillance would result gathering evidence 3 whether initial illegal surveillance flagrant deliberate violation rather accidental
legislators carefully define terminology specify places entitled privacy protection
legislators choose prohibit certain types surveillance prohibiting drone surveillance legislative drafting task become difficult task defining terminology critical layperson sees read word search surveillance legislator means write court may think legislature meant different things using terms like search surveillance reasonable expectations curtilage private property public place terms art legislators specify terms mean
definitional task important part legislative drafting process terminology drive actions allowable places entitled privacy protection legislators consider adopting entirely new set definitions prepared reject existing terminology may confusing good example well thought definitional approach proposed legislation offered professor christopher uses following terms
search effort government find discern evidence unlawful conduct targeted search seeks obtain information specific person circumscribed place general search seeks obtain information people places targets time search
public search search place absence explicit consent focused activities persons limited natural senses person lawful public vantage point could discern time search
probable cause articulable belief search likely produce contraband fruit crime significant evidence wrongdoing
reasonable suspicion articulable belief search likely lead evidence wrongdoing
emergence unmanned aerial vehicles domestic skies raises understandable privacy concerns require careful sometimes creative solutions smartest effective solution adopt property rights approach disrupt status quo approach coupled timebased prohibitions persistent surveillance transparency data retention procedures create effective clear legislative package
legislators reject alarmist calls suggest verge orwellian police 1985 aclu argued amicus brief filed california v ciraolo police observation airplane invasive modern technology upholding search ciraolos yard would alter societys concept privacy later 1988 aclu argued florida v riley allowing police surveillance helicopter orwellian would expose americans homes effects highly intrusive snooping government agents different context 2004 advent iphone police boston going use blackberry phones access public databases equivalent privacy advocates decried use handheld phones mass scrutiny lives activities innocent people violation core democratic principle government permitted violate persons privacy unless reason believe involved reactionary claims get publics attention easy make predicted harms come true sky truly falling careful craft hasty legislation based emotionally charged rhetoric
outright bans use drones broadly worded warrant requirements function equivalent outright ban little protect privacy public safety instances serve protect criminal wrongdoing legislators instead enact legislation maintains current balance legitimate surveillance individuals privacy rights best way achieve goal follow property centric approach coupled limits pervasive surveillance enhanced transparency measures data protection procedures
