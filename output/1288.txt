would say careful sounds good true thats
typical issues fba lost stock high varied shipment costs respect items inability book items correctly used fba 3 years become extremely costly fees change time scan new product get one shipment cost later add another variation magically expensive even though identical packaging weight
load stock returned pulled line sell elsewhere honest received one items would send back need repackaging care products
currently issues delivery checked correctly 30 mid cost items missing also many products stranded france one seems able find seller support useless 3 weeks still sign stock
cost shipping goods via amazon preferred supplier ups increased keeps changing slowly moving away fba except larger products actually cheaper send via service
sales actually went sell less via amazon ever 200 orders month less 100 channels sell seen steady increase line predictions however within space months sales dropped massively amazon tell us problems account site recently money spent sells almost much amazon definitely cant say improved sales
isnt going make 500 increase sales unless exactly right product
test items see get would advice dont expect miracles
would recommend though
