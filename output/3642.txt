autopilot disengaged chief investigator kok soo chon described first turn tracked civilian military radar flight deviated course
manual carried seven simulator tests flight simulators three high four low speed found turn made indeed manual autopilot
however could established next two turns south penang north mekar manual control autopilot added
rest said remained mystery
quick say findings part final report planes disappearance
final report chief investigator kok said
presumptuous us say final report wreckage hasnt found victims found call report final report

radio telephone communication pilot first officer controllers show evidence anxiety stress aircraft maintainers record indicates aircraft well maintained record malfunction defect aircraft ª none could contributed disappearance investigator kok said
possible absence communications prior flight path diversion due systems manually turned whether intent otherwise route followed aircraft height flew suggest mechanical problem aircrafts control system fuel engines
explore mh370 tragedy unfolded
lack evidence includes information recorded fly data recorder recording devices aircraft could indicate aircraft flown southern indian ocean
conclusion team unable determine real cause disappearance mh370
cannot establish aircraft flown anyone pilot said
also exclude possibility theres unlawful interference third party based military record evidence rapid change altitude speed indicate mh370 deliberately evading radar
suspicion naturally fell upon flight crew said
examined pilot zaharia conflict issues friends family shown signs social isolation selfneglect abuse alcohol drugs change habit interest stress anxiety detected audio recordings signs significant behavioural changes observed cctv footage examined competency competent pilot almost flawless records ability handle work stress well

investigator kok said satellite handshakes received automated systems onboard mh370 gave tantalising hints final minutes
two significant events one 225 aircraft initiated handshake likely due power interruption avionics know another handshake clear handshake actually due low fuel levels time resulting loss engines

position flaperon helps explain investigators theory nobody conscious plane crashed
captain shah unconscious researchers assumed mh370 dived ran fuel landed ocean close final satellite position
someone flying plane could glided plane given flaperon deployed concluded nobody control
damage examination indicates right outboard flap likely retracted position right flaperon probably close neutral position time separated wing report said
