geoffrey steinberg seems challenges definition comes ukraine particular crimea legal
review situation looking 10 days referendum going take place

well think go back one step raise question whether current government kiev fact legal
go back last week february three european union foreign ministers going kiev joined emissary russia well agreement reached basically establish interim government president yanukovych still number issues handled diplomatic means violent protesters maidan including people associated organizations fairly called neonazi used force including activating sniper attacks police demonstrators basically affect change government military force violation agreement yanukovych three opposition party heads european foreign ministers signed
look events first really fair evaluate events crimea starting point crisis ukraine
remember began protests activated yanukovych refused back november sign european union eastern alliance partnership agreement quite frankly bad deal standpoint ukrainian sovereign interest including severe economic problems would precipitated gone along signed
cannot selectively pick something occurred process declare illegal whole character current kiev government violates international law legitimately elected undisputed legitimately elected government overthrown violence
unless willingness step back look whole picture see going dangerous direction possibly even leading war confrontation nato russia would horrific
perhaps also aware think gather peter sinnott eu come announced called sanctions pretty much threatening sanction called going target russian officials visa bans joined united states result meeting took place brussels also threatened underline word threatened broad range economic sanctions russia embark steps destabilize ukraine
happen impression eu pretty much guest said economically somewhat obviously reliant russia course big question gas comes play amount gas russia provides eu countries
well first think peter sinnott right left devices european union would much like number one avoid drawn major economic sanctions russia quite frankly russian lot economic leverage
city london handles great deal russian money money russian state funds banks good shape sanctions regime cut flow funds city london financial centers europe could tremendously disastrous impact frankly european banking financial system weak ground
secondly secretary kerry kiev announced us prepared give billion dollars loan guarantees ukraine already widely acknowledged money likely go russia form payments increased cost russian natural gas ukraine especial discount prices negotiated putin yanukovych going cut april

well let finish thought us carries great deal leverage europeans sure various us officials secretary kerry certainly national security advisor rice others working phones maybe even president obama gap european action us action narrowed possible
see content sanctions coming europeans one reserve judgment say well sanctions name sanctions deed remains seen far going go
want say much bigger threat issue namely nato winds border russia ukraine fasttracked eu nato plans even possibly deploy missile defense systems ukraine muted last 24 hours could dealing much greater strategic crisis conflict one economic ties sanctions war danger implicit described people kind reverse cuban missile crisis could bring us brink kind confrontation think anybodys interests served pushing button
geoffrey steinberg seem think bigger picture perhaps military type confrontation may occur know maybe go far back days ago putin actually issue threat us famous press conference home outside moscow said reference us think obviously development eu coming imposing sanctions said us imposes sanctions russia may start using dollar international transactions attempt announce sanctions would end crash financial system united states would cause end domination united states global financial system
think putin would go
well think regardless russian actions transatlantic financial system extremely shaky ground begin think russia decisive determinant factor
european banks going stress tests probably third major european banks systemically significant banks going failing tests undercapitalized eu enormous pressure ecb quantitative easing policy like fed
fed united states sitting portfolio overvalued security assets range two three trillion dollars never happened think fragile ground begin
think economic problems regardless whether get kind pissing contest back forth sanctions russia threatening step away dollar role world reserve currency
