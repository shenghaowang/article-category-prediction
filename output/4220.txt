european unions halfbaked banking union could made work c even though wasnt strictly needed solve euro zones problems agreed isnt designers wanted
original advocates banking union saw way prevent euro collapsing dark days early 2012 idea wellfunded eurowide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking meanwhile banks got trouble strong eurowide safety net would able bail
crisis savers investors lost faith ability weak governments rescue banks thats banking union enthusiasts wanted eurowide support systems
end emerged european policy factory completely different germany latched onto part banking union hadnt previously got much attention centralised supervision banks nixed idea common deposit insurance didnt want hook bailing countries banks berlin also diluted plan eurowide safety net bust banks c though european parliament still trying beef
despite banking union doesnt disaster see important understand euro zone doesnt actually need one
2012 much made doom loop connected weak banks weak governments two elements bust banks dragged governments latter bail bust states dragged banks latter bought many bonds
doom loop remains serious flaw mistake think way cut loop eurowide bailouts better alternatives
look first problem bust banks governments problem taxpayers rescue said governments business bailing banks much better make banks safe enough dont get trouble first place require investors foot bill
indeed broad programme governments around globe pursuing past five years involves preventing credit bubbles forcing banks hold capital bailing bondholders run equity restructuring lenders easy close necessary
eu didnt require banking union push forward
said ecb could speed initiatives
first central bank needs work going stop bubbles new supervisory role known macroprudential powers allow tell national authorities things like jack banks capital ratios fears credit growing strongly
snag many may spoil multiple bodies macroprudential responsibility parts euro zone even ecb two units c new bank supervisor financial stability directorate needs provide clarity going
second many banks dont enough debt could easily bailed run equity solution require banks hold minimum amount debt taxpayers dont ride rescue
done without banking union indeed group 20 nations asked global proposal later year ecb use influence produce robust proposal
theres matter avoiding situations banks deemed important fail bankruptcy would cause havoc whole system c rescued part solution require lenders draw resolution plans spell exactly packed yard without much contagion
banking union required result ecb responsible vetting euro zone banks resolution plans luck central bank less susceptible national supervisors lobbying national champions c force banks restructure needed stop big fail phenomenon
look half doom loop weak sovereigns infect banks yet banking union per se nothing address problem dealt lenders told cant hold certain amount governments bonds
ecb would prefer impose limits part global regime snag countries currencies central banks dont need follow suit ecb may point face going alone
wont easy ecb bite bullets need euro zones halfbaked banking union turned something fit purpose
