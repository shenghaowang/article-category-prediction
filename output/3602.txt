new carl icahn letter
come
believe based evidence newly uncovered donahoes inexcusable incompetence cost ebay stockholders 4 billion read latest letter judge
new york new york march 10 2014 today carl c icahn released following open letter stockholders ebay inc
believe based review evidence currently available public domain including ebays statements following assertions indisputable stockholders judge
ebay ceo john donahoe oversaw premature sale skype diminished price resulted ebay stockholders losing 4 billion compared sale skype microsoft 18 months later
doubt ebay private company donahoe would fired facts disclosed owners sadly many public companies ebay lack accountability transgressions management swept rug crony boards middle management makes costly error pay price ceo makes one often old boy board covers gives bonus
regardless microsoft clearly interested buying skype walked away concerns technology licensing litigation ebay skypes founders
2009 donahoe decided sell skype according ebay competitive process multiple bidders including several financial strategic buyers 1 sure whether actually multiple bidders ebay originally stated whether ebay merely contacted multiple financial strategic buyers 2 claim
litigation uncovered skypes founders alleged john donahoe ebay director marc andreessens investor group received information mike volpi associate skypes founders could workaround technology subject licensing dispute ebay skypes founders reportedly cause microsoft walking away
apparent benefit information andreessens investor group purchased controlling interest skype ebay 19 billion andreessen investor group quickly settled licensing litigation skypes founders flipped skype microsoft 85 billion tripling money 18 months obvious unanswered question didnt donahoe allegedly also information would key reaching settlement skypes founders settle ebay sell skype directly microsoft thereby keeping extra 4 billion ebay stockholders
make matters even embarrassing donahoe marc andreessen boasted upon announcement sale microsoft groups risks buying skype always less appeared said knew microsoft number companies skype would obvious thing buy would always fallback selling strategic obviously logic also applied donahoe therefore sell skype andreessen investor group instead keeping 4 billion stockholders would interesting see donahoes face andreessen actually boasted windfall board donahoe typical pr speech swept 4 billion fiasco rug actually boasted success executing transaction ebay andreessen investor group however joe nocera new york times appear fooled ebays pr machine time sale andreessens group wrote mystery skype deal winning bidders willing pay high price company whose existence could threatened lawsuit one possibility nerves steel know something nobody else
amazingly donahoe chose sell controlling interest skype andreessens investor group allowing reap billions expense ebay stockholders rather cleaning licensing issues pursuing lucrative exit ipo sale strategic buyer
first year student finance would understand want sell company party wishes buy concerned technology licensing issues fix issues sell even absurd know potential solution believe stockholders must consider whether donahoe either incompetent negligent perhaps even worse simply taking easy path bowing wishes respected powerful board member rate failure cost ebay stockholders 4 billion
successful companies years brought right ceo sometimes convincing boards make changes takes years change ultimately comes results often startlingly good last year simply examine successes forest laboratories chesapeake energy etc believe least ebay stockholders must send donahoe board message unhappy current situation ebay addition egregious issues surrounding skype situation also noted past year ebay underperformed peers indeed january 1 2013 initial involvement january 10 2014 amazon visa mastercard returned 60 48 73 respectively ebay stock returned 2
opinion ebay paypal immediately separated firm belief occurred would number bidders willing pay large premium independent paypal however hand fear left management ebay wither elon musk said believe left division ebay paypal may well go way former technology greats blackberry dell eastman kodak polaroid nintendo xerox sony palm aol way motorola mobility may gone able convince motorolas board bring new ceo separate companies ultimately resulting sale google
paypal must separated
sadly opinion opinion others ebay years wait paypal great company going war strong adversaries google apple visa etc win war need great generals proven competence loyalty unfortunately obvious us lacking ebay great management attracted management make right decision know sell right time worst time
true owners ebay cannot tolerate longer behavior exhibited ceo john donahoe board detailed believe ebay quintessential example wrong corporate governance many public corporations system dysfunctional stockholders send clear message ebay board longer tolerate internecine relationships come accepted commonplace ebay perhaps importantly continue follow advice donahoe even light transgressions regarding skype well failures outlined allow continue lead ebay paypal paypal fails elon musk others far knowledgeable warned investors shares institutions funds control voting ebay stock every right cast blame everyone failed vote change ebay
time come send ebay board message longer business usual ebay vote precatory proposal director nominees
