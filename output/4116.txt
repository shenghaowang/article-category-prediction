thought story malaysian plane couldnt get complicated sunday proved us wrong
malaysian government stated definitively aircrafts communications locator systems deliberately shut left malaysian airspace plane changed direction lost altitude satellite picked signals airplane signals continued seven hours last regular communication amount time could flown amount fuel tanks
pilots lost plane become suspects homes searched aircrafts activity required great skill well familiarity systems boeing 77 especially shutting aircraft communications addressing reporting system automatically broadcasts data planes position flight ground control without involving pilot transponder system identified plane ground radar comparatively easy shut single switch moved shutting acars multistep process demands thorough knowledge plane
rather making search easier moving us closer finding airplane new information makes solution mystery farther grasp expands search radius significantly focused flight corridor included planes planned flight path scene disappearance become vast indian ocean seven flight hours general western direction time planes last report would put aircraft infinite number places makes search like looking needle haystack
anyway everyone particularly americans huge interest finding plane manufactured us trying narrow search moment possible northern route passes india kazakhstan discussed makes less sense areas plane would pass covered military ground radar countries high level alert route seems logical one turns south strait malacca toward southern indian ocean would brought plane within 100 kilometers 600 miles perth western australia
