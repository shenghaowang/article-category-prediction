since got read solid hopelessly clueless oped obamacare washington times joe curl brings us special seems noticed days back 46 million people united states uninsured 2009 researchers harvard medical school found 4500 people year died lacked insurance nice curl finally noticed however turns saw another big number news recently haz confusion per curl
larger number end march mr obama promised interview webmd point enough people signing affordable care act going work still obvious question changed 27 trillion health care system sign 42 million people
obvious answer calm thats im actually concerned gets left far uninsured obamacare era actually im clearly concerned prefer get stuff right
first place 46 million people uninsured number thats estimate according census bureau according congressional budget offices february 2014 baseline covering insurance coverage provisions affordable care act actually 57 million uninsured people marketplace prior law perfectly legitimate estimates since ill referring cbo projections figure well use higher number
secondly 42 million figure refers people enroll exchanges people suddenly health insurance come rolls uninsured participate exchanges arent really participating radically altered 27 trillion health care system theyre purchasing health insurance old insurance companies people always purchased insurance albeit equitable marketplace stronger regulations governing types policies purchase
42 million figure much lower administration wants hope point year much higher time time administration suggested benchmark success 7 million exchange enrollees times theyve walked back administration holding 6 million enrollees goal fair say 7 million number administration would like hit event bottom line blame disastrous first month exchanges open depressing enrollment administration definitely owns shortfall numbers
nevertheless figures also dont count people buy direct health insurance company even though almost people buying acacompliant plans anyone grandfathered plan one extended plans risk pool exchange enrollees said done going lot people acacompliant plans ie new market individual insurance broadly speaking number people actually use exchange buy insurance
course 6 million 7 million thats still small number talking uninsured population ahh remember health insurance exchanges arent way affordable care act supposed reduce ranks uninsured furthermore one ever promised substantial reductions large number uninsured going happen quite rapidly check cbos projections
one things curl forgetting affordable care act also reducing ranks uninsured expanding medicaid childrens health insurance program fact fully implemented laws first two years expansion programs projected least significant impact reducing pool uninsured americans exchanges time get 2016 however total number uninsured drops 25 million percentage us population law projected insure 89 percent population 2017 92 percent exclude unauthorized immigrants total us population denominator theres lot support expanding obamacare benefits population anyway
theres also number people currently insured dint rule allows younger americans remain parents insurance policies 26 years old hard track easy tout rosier number think washington posts glenn kessler done best provides conservative estimate
first estimated 31 million americans younger 26 joined parents plans provision took effect september 2010 one big caveat health human services department estimate two years old never updated fact checker dug recent reports found based single quarterly figure sustained later quarters might report never updated however overall increase percentage insured young adults suggests gain 28 million third quarter 2010 first half 2013 given quarterly fluctuations conservative approach would use average figure 2010 base would reduce increase 22 million people still substantial
percentage americans without health insurance continues fall measuring 159 far 2014 compared 171 fourth quarter 2013 uninsured rate declining since fourth quarter 2013 hitting alltime high 180 third quarter uninsured rate first quarter 2014 far includes 162 reading january 156 february uninsured rate almost every major demographic group dropped 2014 far percentage uninsured americans annual household income less 3600 dropped 28 percentage points 279 since fourth quarter 2013 percentage uninsured blacks fallen 26 points 183 hispanics remain subgroup likely lack health insurance uninsured rate 379 percentage uninsured declined across age groups year except aged 65 older uninsured rate group likely remained stable americans aged 65 older medicare uninsured rate among 26 35 continues decline 266 163 respectively
pretty good told still leaves lot people uninsured thanks study conducted urban institute wake forest university know something people people reside states expanding medicaid undocumented immigrants arent even allowed use exchanges buy insurance money others perhaps people obama administration concerned still find insurance unaffordable even subsidies available exchanges
whats done help still substantial population thats actually much better question changed 27 trillion health care system sign 42 million people thats sort thing ask concern uninsured population united states didnt begin yesterday one answers number people would get coverage expanded medicaid arent getting governors hate obamacare constituents
