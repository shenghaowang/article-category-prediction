resource conservation part fabric come surprise welcomed university california president janet napolitanos call cut water consumption 20 percent 2020 fact already exceeded expectation c year
napolitano announced new initiative cut percapita water use first year saying california experiences driest winter record uc must part preserve states precious natural resource
uc merced began slashing water usage long even specter drought began loom 201213 school year uc merced reduced percapita water use 43 percent since 2007
uc merceds design c inception c incorporated goals water electricity usage 40 percent baseline levels uc campuses campus infrastructure designed conserve water nativeplant landscaping droughtresistant permeable pavement stormwater retention
universitys drinking sewer irrigation water carefully audited building individually metered officials see realtime usage metering system also used year residencehall competition see building cut water use competition started student although since graduated effort continues
beyond bestpractice conservation measures implemented throughout campus researchers examining changes water amounts availability affecting variety environments coast sierra nevada peaks c ground
research field lab help us better understand expect future suggest solutions could undertaken
example reduced snowpack lower precipitation throughout state mean earlier soil drying less water irrigation basic needs researchers working discover effects factors higher elevations way downstream valley floor fragile agricultural ecosystem
addition paleoecologist professor jessica blois scouring sierra nevada fossil record see previous droughts tell us similar events today future might affect plants animals including humans work suggests regions landscape beyond could look much different coming decades plants animals migrate climates better suit
kind research adds database allows researchers model largescale local impacts multiyear droughts
californias drought critical problem immediate effects year c including availability prices valley produce c well lasting legacy
thats stepping efforts understand impact drought states vitality redoubling commitment design operate facilities sustainable manner
