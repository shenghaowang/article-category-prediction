herbalife ltd hlfs new regulatory language really mean quoth raven
herbalife files form 10k yesterday inclusive brand new statements regarding fcpa ftcs investigation company
stock marked companys guide q1 clear market thinks language good news
company seems know direction ftc wants go disagree good news surprise heres reasoning
let start saying comments companys disclosure legal advice professional financial advice nothing speculation speaking several legal minds last night trying draw conclusions people sides herbalife case
investors chance take look herbalifes fourthquarter full year results company beat lines reporting 119 really 098 exclude large series recurring nonrecurring expenses look like
company came lowered guidance firstquarter full year 2016 despite fact china falling yet wasnt much else anomalous financials noticed
stock almost 15 afterhours trading regulatory language company added annual report every year people follow company look new language annual filing purposefully added purposefully deleted like done twitter
herbalife might know little scope ftcs case mean well discuss later
someone written disclosures securities lawyers filings someone worked extensively another party done reviewing herbalifes annual report yesterday think additions companys annual report telling even leave company open wide range outcomes cant yet speculate
intents purposes two important additions companys annual report yesterday
first addition line one talking ftc
line key
second addition entire new risk factor talks foreign corrupt practices act section report company needs report risks associated business part looked like
lets talk ftc language first language seems lead wide range outcomes possible conversations last night several legal minds helped shape narrative could potentially happening herbalife ftc heres points ive come
looks though going see resolution next step ftc soon
language seems mark end document production phase company
found interesting company would include contested complaint language wasnt serious chance happening
ftc going resolve things without taking action dont feel would language put 10k believe happening ftc potentially told herbalife intentions perhaps even shown copy complaint company would explain know scope outcome pointed earlier
think ftc may tipped hand company possibly want apply stringent vemma standards herbalife guess herbalife come back ftc said way comply ftc wants would devastating business stage believe could company odds ftc route go
ftc may want injunction asset freeze equitable relief victims herbalife may want pay monetary fine move case question much ftc wants hold ground given success ftc vemma believe die situation ftc hallmark edith ramirez tenure chairwoman let company go collapses would tarnish reputation regulator years come last stand mlms ftc c either theyre going allowed continue obvious pyramid schemes c scholars experts dissenting ftc slap wrist c ftc seek true justice long overdue equitable relief
another point would like make good news would herbalife say something press release effect working resolution working settlement wanted keep quiet read boilerplate statement conference call comes boilerplate way buried page 100 10k way michael johnson almost sadly read statement starts around end conference call verbatim exactly way filing without
right company controlling narrative public press made statements news media picking fine ftc made statement company since started investigation dont expect end narrative pushed public discourse believe truly great news company would trumpeting little bit different fashion fine c eventually much detail ftc decides make move
second addition companys annual report fcpa language added risk factors paste interesting language included
policies mandate compliance antibribery laws including requirements maintain accurate information internal controls operate many parts world experienced governmental corruption degree certain circumstances strict compliance antibribery laws may conflict local customs practices notwithstanding compliance programs include annual training certification requirements assurance internal control policies procedures protect us acts committed employees agents additionally cannot predict nature scope effect future regulatory requirements international operations might subject manner existing new laws might administered interpreted alleged actual violations existing future laws either due acts inadvertence due acts inadvertence others may result criminal civil sanctions including contract cancellations loss reputation could material adverse effect business financial condition results operations
write boilerplate language
fcpa violations relatively serious company add risk factors like reason true doj regulatory bodies cracking significantly fcpa violations reason arbitrarily ad carefully crafted language companys annual report
course bear going see narrative best fits conclusion want draw also see bull side case believe good news objectively though three items buried page 100 mean anything happen company driven stock price done true fashion critic connor davidson pointed
others may place bets accordingly believe company probably process butting heads ftc outcome investigation believe civil complaint could filed ftc short order
believe herbalife knows ftc seeking hence removal scope language 10k lets hear company sing sister
course herbalife makes concessions agrees pay cash chance settlement ask whether ftc went trouble dismantling vemma order set precedent herbalife would ignore vemma huge win ftc qtr thinks natural progression things ftc try act similar circumstances herbalife
ftc goes vemma route herbalife put stranglehold business ruin companys reputation even stock would likely spike one time giving fantastic short opportunity interested riding final asphyxiation companys multilevel marketing model
