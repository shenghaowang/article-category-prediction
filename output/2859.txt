however ftc simply doesnt ignore evidence theyre organization full intelligent professionals think critically based headlines pr theyre type organization would looking company wasnt something appeared suspect something already caught ears ftc look theres chance whole ball become unwound
herbalifes response nothing short hilarious pr team must one hell week outrageous response ny times article brilliance display yesterday

brainwashed thats good laugh speaking brainwashed one day soon im going write incredibly crazy similarities herbalife havent gotten around yet despite couple times
back ftc arent many things think certainty point however chance ftc stepping preparing investigation ultimately nothing seems extremely unlikely dont exactly dig far surface realize herbalife could big problems hands
