unemployment rate measure prevalence unemployment calculated percentage dividing number unemployed individuals individuals currently labor force periods recession economy usually experiences relatively high unemployment rate1 according international labour organization report 200 million people globally 6 worlds workforce without job 20122
causes unemployment heavily debated3 classical economics new classical economics austrian school economics argued market mechanisms reliable means resolving unemployment theories argue interventions imposed labor market outside unionization bureaucratic work rules minimum wage laws taxes regulations claim discourage hiring workers keynesian economics emphasizes cyclical nature unemployment recommends government interventions economy claims reduce unemployment recessions theory focuses recurrent shocks suddenly reduce aggregate demand goods services thus reduce demand workers keynesian models recommend government interventions designed increase demand workers include financial stimuli publicly funded job creation expansionist monetary policies namesake economist john maynard keynes believed root cause unemployment desire investors receive money rather produce products possible without public bodies producing new money4 third group theories emphasize need stable supply capital investment maintain full employment5 view government guarantee full employment fiscal policy monetary policy trade policy stated example us employment act 1946 counteracting private sector trade investment volatility reducing inequality6
addition comprehensive theories unemployment categorizations unemployment used precisely model effects unemployment within economic system main types unemployment include structural unemployment frictional unemployment well cyclical unemployment involuntary unemployment classical unemployment structural unemployment focuses foundational problems economy inefficiencies inherent labor markets including mismatch supply demand laborers necessary skill sets structural arguments emphasize causes solutions related disruptive technologies globalization discussions frictional unemployment focus voluntary decisions work based individuals valuation work compares current wage rates plus time effort required find job causes solutions frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold wage rates
state without work educated person earning ones livelihood meant unemployment economists distinguish various overlapping types theories unemployment including cyclical keynesian unemployment frictional unemployment structural unemployment classical unemployment additional types unemployment occasionally mentioned seasonal unemployment hardcore unemployment hidden unemployment
though several definitions voluntary involuntary unemployment economics literature simple distinction often applied voluntary unemployment attributed individuals decisions whereas involuntary unemployment exists socioeconomic environment including market structure government intervention level aggregate demand individuals operate terms much frictional unemployment voluntary since reflects individual search behavior voluntary unemployment includes workers reject low wage jobs whereas involuntary unemployment includes workers fired due economic crisis industrial decline company bankruptcy organizational restructuring
hand cyclical unemployment structural unemployment classical unemployment largely involuntary nature however existence structural unemployment may reflect choices made unemployed past classical natural unemployment may result legislative economic choices made labour unions political parties practice distinction voluntary involuntary unemployment hard draw
clearest cases involuntary unemployment fewer job vacancies unemployed workers even wages allowed adjust even vacancies filled unemployed workers would still remain happens cyclical unemployment macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment boomerang back exacerbate macroeconomic forces
classical realwage unemployment occurs real wages job set marketclearing level causing number jobseekers exceed number vacancies hand economists argue wages fall livable wage many choose fall labor market longer seek employment especially true countries lowincome families supported public welfare systems cases wages would high enough motivate people choose employment receive public welfare wages livable wage likely result lower labor market participation stated scenario addition must noted consumption goods services primary driver increased need labor higher wages lead workers income available consume goods services therefore higher wages increase general consumption result need labor increases unemployment decreases economy
many economists argued unemployment increases increased governmental regulation example minimum wage laws raise cost lowskill laborers market equilibrium resulting increased unemployment people wish work going rate cannot new higher enforced wage greater value labour78 laws restricting layoffs may make businesses less likely hire first place hiring becomes risky8
however argument overly simplifies relationship wage rates unemployment ignoring numerous factors contribute unemployment910111213 murray rothbard suggest even social taboos prevent wages falling marketclearing level14
work unemployment government twentiethcentury america economists richard vedder lowell gallaway argue empirical record wages rates productivity unemployment american validates classical unemployment theory data shows strong correlation adjusted real wage unemployment united states 1900 1990 however maintain data take account exogenous events15
cyclical deficientdemand keynesian unemployment occurs enough aggregate demand economy provide jobs everyone wants work demand goods services falls less production needed consequently fewer workers needed wages sticky fall meet equilibrium level mass unemployment results16 name derived frequent shifts business cycle although unemployment also persistent occurred great depression 1930s
cyclical unemployment number unemployed workers exceeds number job vacancies even full employment attained open jobs filled workers would still remain unemployed associate cyclical unemployment frictional unemployment factors cause friction partially caused cyclical variables example surprise decrease money supply may shock rational economic factors suddenly inhibit aggregate demand
keynesian economists hand see lack supply jobs potentially resolvable government intervention one suggested interventions involves deficit spending boost employment demand another intervention involves expansionary monetary policy increases supply money reduce interest rates lead increase nongovernmental spending17
marxists share keynesian viewpoint relationship economic demand employment caveat market systems propensity slash wages reduce labor participation enterprise level causes requisite decrease aggregate demand economy whole causing crises unemployment periods low economic activity capital accumulation investment phase economic growth continue
according karl marx unemployment inherent within unstable capitalist system periodic crises mass unemployment expected theorized unemployment inevitable even necessary part capitalist system recovery regrowth also part process19 function proletariat within capitalist system provide reserve army labour creates downward pressure wages accomplished dividing proletariat surplus labour employees underemployment unemployed20 reserve army labour fight among scarce jobs lower lower wages
first glance unemployment seems inefficient since unemployed workers increase profits unemployment profitable within global capitalist system unemployment lowers wages costs perspective owners perspective low wages benefit system reducing economic rents yet benefit workers according karl marx workers proletariat work benefit bourgeoisie production capital21 capitalist systems unfairly manipulate market labour perpetuating unemployment lowers laborers demands fair wages workers pitted one another service increasing profits owners result capitalist mode production marx argued workers experienced alienation estrangement economic identity22
according marx way permanently eliminate unemployment would abolish capitalism system forced competition wages shift socialist communist economic system contemporary marxists existence persistent unemployment proof inability capitalism ensure full employment23
demandbased theory possible abolish cyclical unemployment increasing aggregate demand products workers however eventually economy hits inflation barrier imposed four kinds unemployment extent exist historical experience suggests low unemployment affects inflation short term long term24 long term velocity money supply measures mzm money zero maturity representing cash equivalent demand deposits velocity far predictive inflation low unemployment2526
demand theory economists see inflation barrier corresponding natural rate unemployment natural rate unemployment defined rate unemployment exists labour market equilibrium pressure neither rising inflation rates falling inflation rates alternative technical term rate nairu nonaccelerating inflation rate unemployment matter name demand theory holds means unemployment rate gets low inflation accelerate absence wage price controls incomes policies
one major problems nairu theory one knows exactly nairu clearly changes time24 margin error quite high relative actual unemployment rate making hard use nairu policymaking25
another normative definition full employment might called ideal unemployment rate would exclude types unemployment represent forms inefficiency type full employment unemployment would correspond frictional unemployment excluding part encouraging mcjobs management strategy would thus low however would impossible attain fullemployment target using demandside keynesian stimulus without getting nairu causing accelerating inflation absent incomes policies training programs aimed fighting structural unemployment would help
extent hidden unemployment exists implies official unemployment statistics provide poor guide unemployment rate coincides full employment24
structural unemployment occurs labour market unable provide jobs everyone wants one mismatch skills unemployed workers skills needed available jobs structural unemployment hard separate empirically frictional unemployment except say lasts longer frictional unemployment simple demandside stimulus work easily abolish type unemployment
structural unemployment may also encouraged rise persistent cyclical unemployment economy suffers longlasting low aggregate demand means many unemployed become disheartened skills including jobsearching skills become rusty obsolete problems debt may lead homelessness fall vicious circle poverty
means may fit job vacancies created economy recovers implication sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment theory persistence structural unemployment referred example path dependence hysteresis
much technological unemployment27 due replacement workers machines might counted structural unemployment alternatively technological unemployment might refer way steady increases labour productivity mean fewer workers needed produce level output every year fact aggregate demand raised deal problem suggests problem instead one cyclical unemployment indicated okuns law demand side must grow sufficiently quickly absorb growing labour force also workers made redundant increased labour productivity
seasonal unemployment may seen kind structural unemployment since type unemployment linked certain kinds jobs construction work migratory farm work mostcited official unemployment measures erase kind unemployment statistics using seasonal adjustment techniques results substantial permanent structural unemployment
frictional unemployment time period jobs worker searching transitioning one job another sometimes called search unemployment voluntary based circumstances unemployed individual
frictional unemployment exists jobs workers heterogeneous mismatch result characteristics supply demand mismatch related skills payment worktime location seasonal industries attitude taste multitude factors new entrants graduating students reentrants former homemakers also suffer spell frictional unemployment
workers well employers accept certain level imperfection risk compromise usually right away invest time effort find better match fact beneficial economy since results better allocation resources however search takes long mismatches frequent economy suffers since work get done therefore governments seek ways reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment multiple means including providing education advice training assistance daycare centers
frictions labour market sometimes illustrated graphically beveridge curve downwardsloping convex curve shows correlation unemployment rate one axis vacancy rate changes supply demand labour cause movements along curve increase decrease labour market frictions shift curve outwards inwards
hidden covered unemployment unemployment potential workers reflected official unemployment statistics due way statistics collected many countries work actively looking work andor qualifying social security benefits counted unemployed given looking work sometimes government retraining programs officially counted among unemployed even though employed
statistic also count underemployedªthose working fewer hours would prefer job doesnt make good use capabilities addition working age currently fulltime education usually considered unemployed government statistics traditional unemployed native societies survive gathering hunting herding farming wilderness areas may may counted unemployment statistics official statistics often underestimate unemployment rates hidden unemployment
longterm unemployment defined european union statistics unemployment lasting longer one year united states bureau labor statistics bls reports current longterm unemployment rate 19 percent defines unemployment lasting 27 weeks longer longterm unemployment component structural unemployment results longterm unemployment existing every social group industry occupation levels education28
also different ways national statistical agencies measure unemployment differences may limit validity international comparisons unemployment data29 degree differences remain despite national statistical agencies increasingly adopting definition unemployment international labour organization30 facilitate international comparisons organizations oecd eurostat international labor comparisons program adjust data unemployment comparability across countries
though many people care number unemployed individuals economists typically focus unemployment rate corrects normal increase number people employed due increases population increases labour force relative population unemployment rate expressed percentage calculated follows
defined international labour organization unemployed workers currently working willing able work pay currently available work actively searched work31 individuals actively seeking job placement must make effort contact employer job interviews contact job placement agencies send resumes submit applications respond advertisements means active job searching within prior four weeks simply looking advertisements responding count actively seeking job placement since unemployment may open counted government agencies official statistics unemployment may accurate32 united states example unemployment rate take consideration individuals actively looking employment still attending college33
ilo describes 4 different methods calculate unemployment rate34
labour force sample surveys preferred method unemployment rate calculation since give comprehensive results enables calculation unemployment different group categories race gender method internationally comparable
official estimates determined combination information one three methods use method declining favor labour surveys
social insurance statistics unemployment benefits computed base number persons insured representing total labour force number persons insured collecting benefits method heavily criticized due expiration benefits person finds work
employment office statistics least effective include monthly tally unemployed persons enter employment offices method also includes unemployed unemployed per ilo definition
primary measure unemployment u3 allows comparisons countries unemployment differs country country across different time periods example 1990s 200s united states lower unemployment levels many countries european union35 significant internal variation countries like uk denmark outperforming italy france however large economic events great depression lead similar unemployment rates across globe
eurostat statistical office european union defines unemployed persons age 15 74 working looked work last four weeks ready start work within two weeks conform ilo standards actual count rate unemployment reported statistical data available member state european union whole eu28 well euro area ea19 eurostat also includes longterm unemployment rate defined part unemployed unemployed excess 1 year36
main source used european union labour force survey eulfs eulfs collects data member states quarter monthly calculations national surveys national registers employment offices used conjunction quarterly eulfs data exact calculation individual countries resulting harmonized monthly data depends availability data37
bureau labor statistics measures employment unemployment 17 years age using two different labor force surveys39 conducted united states census bureau within united states department commerce andor bureau labor statistics within united states department labor gather employment statistics monthly current population survey cps household survey conducts survey based sample 6000 households survey measures unemployment rate based ilo definition40
current employment statistics survey ces payroll survey conducts survey based sample 16000 businesses government agencies represent 40000 individual employers41 survey measures civilian nonagricultural employment thus calculate unemployment rate differs ilo unemployment rate definition two sources different classification criteria usually produce differing results additional data also available government unemployment insurance weekly claims report available office workforce security within us department labor employment training administration42 bureau labor statistics provides uptodate numbers via pdf linked here43 bls also provides readable concise current employment situation summary updated monthly44
bureau labor statistics also calculates six alternate measures unemployment u1 u6 measure different aspects unemployment45
u2 percentage labor force lost jobs completed temporary work
u3 official unemployment rate per ilo definition occurs people without jobs actively looked work within past four weeks47

u5 u4 marginally attached workers loosely attached workers would like able work looked work recently
u6 u5 parttime workers want work fulltime cannot due economic reasons underemployment
note marginally attached workers added total labour force unemployment rate calculation u4 u5 u6 bls revised cps 1994 among changes measure representing official unemployment rate renamed u3 instead u548 2013 representative hunter proposed bureau labor statistics use u5 rate instead current u3 rate49

critics believe current methods measuring unemployment inaccurate terms impact unemployment people methods take account 15 available working population incarcerated us prisons may may working incarcerated lost jobs become discouraged time actively looking work selfemployed wish become selfemployed tradesmen building contractors consultants retired official retirement age would still like work involuntary early retirees disability pensions possessing full health still wish work occupations suitable medical conditions work payment little one hour per week would like work fulltime57
last people involuntary parttime workers underemployed eg computer programmer working retail store find permanent job involuntary stayathome mothers would prefer work graduate professional school students unable find worthwhile jobs graduated bachelors degrees
internationally nations unemployment rates sometimes muted appear less severe due number selfemployed individuals working agriculture52 small independent farmers often considered selfemployed cannot unemployed impact nonindustrialized economies united states europe early 19th century overall unemployment approximately 3 many individuals selfemployed independent farmers yet unemployment outside agriculture high 8052
many economies industrialize experience increasing numbers nonagricultural workers example united states nonagricultural labour force increased 20 1800 50 1850 97 20052 shift away selfemployment increases percentage population included unemployment rates comparing unemployment rates countries time periods best consider differences levels industrialization selfemployment
additionally measures employment unemployment may high countries availability unemployment benefits inflate statistics since give incentive register unemployed people seek work may choose declare unemployed get benefits people undeclared paid occupations may try get unemployment benefits addition money earn work58
however countries united states canada mexico australia japan european union unemployment measured using sample survey akin gallup poll30 according bls number eastern european nations instituted labour force surveys well sample survey problems total number workers economy calculated based sample rather census
possible neither employed unemployed ilo definitions ie outside labour force32 people job looking one many people going school retired family responsibilities keep others labour force still others physical mental disability prevents participating labour force activities people simply elect work preferring dependent others sustenance
typically employment labour force include work done monetary gain hence homemaker neither part labour force unemployed fulltime students prisoners considered part labour force unemployment57 latter important 199 economists lawrence f katz alan b krueger estimated increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment united states 017 1985 late 1990s57
particular 2005 roughly 07 us population incarcerated 15 available working population additionally children elderly individuals disabilities typically counted part labour force correspondingly included unemployment statistics however elderly many disabled individuals active labour market
early stages economic boom unemployment often rises16 people join labour market give studying start job hunt etc result improving job market actually found position counted unemployed similarly recession increase unemployment rate moderated people leaving labour force otherwise discounted labour force selfemployed
