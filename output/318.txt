time come china let yuan float
china crossroads three decades unprecedentedly rapid gross domestic product gdp growth country weathered global economic crisis exceptionally well however sustains considerable economic imbalances undermining ability achieve highincome status
question whether chinas leaders ª preoccupied challenges financial instability stemming risky shadowbanking activities heavy burden localgovernment debt ª policy space put economy sounder footing
aftermath global economic crisis china appeared track complete rebalancing currentaccount surplus fell 10 per cent gdp 2007 26 per cent 2012 ran large capitalaccount deficit first time since 1998
moreover china added us987 billion s125 billion foreignexchange reserves 2012 compared average annual increase us435 billion 2007 2011 meant diminishing upward pressure yuans exchange rate
however past year chinas imbalances returned vengeance trade surplus last year probably exceeded us250 billion capitalaccount surplus exceeded us200 billion first three quarters year foreignexchange reserves soared us510 billion
meanwhile lower currentaccount surplus share gdp could result increased investmentincome deficit recovery advanced economies boosted exports persistent overcapacity combined slower householdconsumption growth 2012 caused investment growth though still rapid decline lowest rate past 11 years
resources grossly
misallocated
principle country run currentaccount deficit surplus continuously decades however chinas chronic surpluses problematic
given china remains among worlds poorest countries per capita income amounting less us700 position worlds largest exporter capital signifies gross misallocation resources
fact running twin current capitalaccount surpluses persistently two decades chinas foreignexchange reserves poised break us4 trillion threshold marginal cost every dollar accrued vastly surpassing potential benefits
context continued accumulation foreignexchange reserves clearly counterproductive
course rebalancing chinas economy take time entail risks sacrifices however chinas leaders must recognise country faces massive welfare losses thus willing accept slower growth short term exchange stable longterm growth path
fact welldesigned policy package duration impact growth slowdown could minimised
critical first step peoples bank china stop intervening foreignexchange market would halt growth countrys foreignexchange reserves words china adopt floating exchangerate regime soon possible
although transition would negative impact chinas economic growth would nearly dire many seem believe starters would probably cause yuan strengthen consensus china current exchange rate far equilibrium level meaning appreciation would probably moderate
similarly although yuan appreciation would diminish export growth slowdown would probably dramatic given chinas export sector dominated processing trade specifically assembly intermediate inputs imported countries japan south korea
accompanying increase imports probably damage chinas economic growth significantly likely complement rather substitute domestic demand short china afford costs rebalancing
tackling hot money
given liquidity flowing china past several years increasingly shortterm capital aimed exchangerate interestrate arbitrage socalled hot money may surge capital outflows appreciation expectations disappeared
prevent largescale capital flight threatening chinas financial stability crossborder flows must managed carefully
flexible exchange rate dictated market forces would eliminate opportunities currency speculators make oneway bets yuan appreciation thereby diminishing stock hot money currently accounts bulk chinas capitalaccount surplus
even chinas current account remained surplus time shift twin surpluses normal external position would boost efficiency resource allocation considerably
long china delayed necessary adjustment balanceofpayments structure time make change even requires brace risks
