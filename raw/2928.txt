<p>In London, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has started its own probe. The Bank of England (BoE) has also come under scrutiny for allegedly condoning the way currency traders at different banks shared information with each other at meetings with the senior bankers.</p>
<p>Communications between traders are a key part of several regulatory probes across the world into suspected currency market manipulation. The BoE denied ever condoning activity that was against the rules.</p>
<p>The BoE has suspended one official and revealed it stopped meeting a group of top London currency dealers in February 2013 amid an internal review.</p>
<p>"The BoE does not condone any form of market manipulation in any context whatsoever," said the central bank.</p>
<p>"The Bank has today reiterated its guidance to staff regarding management of records and escalation of important information."</p>
<p>It added that the internal review has not found any evidence that BoE staff colluded in any such manipulation or shared confidential client information.</p>
