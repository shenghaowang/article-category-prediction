</p>
<p>SINGAPORE: Gold extended gains to a third session on Thursday, scaling fresh six-month highs as investors sought to hedge their bets against geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and economic slowdown fears in China. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Markets are eyeing more data from China due on Thursday to determine the state of the economy, after a recent bond default and a weak exports report sent equities and base metals lower.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political uncertainty, when the metal is preferred by investors over riskier assets such as equities. It has gained 14% so far this year on the global uncertainties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Spot gold rose 0.4% to US$1,371.80 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after jumping 1.3% on Wednesday. The metal earlier on Thursday hit US$1,374.45, its highest since Sept 19. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Technical buying has also been supportive of price momentum in the last two sessions, especially after prices cleared a recent high near US$1,355 an ounce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Given bullion's technical break, it may be at risk of profit-taking in the near term, barring an escalation of Eastern European tensions," HSBC analysts said in a note.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Geopolitical events can have a pronounced, but sometimes short-lived impact on gold."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>US gold futures also rose on Thursday, hitting the highest mark since Sept 10.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reuters technicals analyst Wang Tao said spot gold faces resistance at US$1,375-US$1,377, a break above which will open the way towards US$1,433.31, the Aug 28 high. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The biggest factor driving gold prices at the moment is the stand-off between the West and Russia over Ukraine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The EU agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War, a stronger response to the Ukraine crisis than many expected and a mark of solidarity with Washington in the drive to make Moscow pay for seizing Crimea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>New money has been flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds in recent weeks, in a sign of investor confidence, after record outflows last year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 1.50 tonnes to 811.20 tonnes on Wednesday – the first decline since Feb 19.</p>
<p> Physical demand has been subdued due to the price rally, with prices in China – the biggest bullion consumer – trading at a discount to spot prices. – Reuters<br/>
