<p>Looks like the corporate tug of war between Jos. A. Bank and Men's Wearhouse is over.</p>
<p>The rival company based out of state has apparently been successful in its attempt to acquire the Hampstead clothing company known for its 2 for 1 offers.</p>
<p>The price is reported to be $1.8 billion in cash.</p>
<p>The latest tender offer from Men's Wearhouse was approved unanimously by both boards.</p>
<p>Doug Ewert, President and Chief Executive Officer of Men's Wearhouse, will lead the combined company.</p>
<p>The deal will create the fourth largest men's clothing retailer in the country.</p>
<p>Men's Wearhouse fashions typically appeals to younger buyers while Jos. A. Bank is favored by older, more conservative and often more affluent customers.</p>
<p>And it's yet to be seen how the combined company will approach merchandizing, according to clothing retail analyst Andria Cheng with Marketwatch.com.</p>
<p>The Bank name will survive the merger, but, it's not clear how many stores will be closed in the process, Cheng said.</p>
<p>As for the Bank headquarters in Hampstead, Maryland, no clear decision on that is yet evident.</p>
<p>The combination will have 23,000 employees with 1,700 stores nationwide.</p>
<p>It's expected the Eddie Bauer purchase by Bank will likely be broken off.</p>

<p>One lawmaker who represents Carroll County in Annapolis calls news of the takeover a "sad occasion."</p>
<p>Republican State Senator Joe Getty told WBAL News that he is "worried that in a competitive industry, the company might close the (Jos. A. Bank) headquarters."</p>
<p>Getty says he has heard from some worried workers at the Hampstead facility, which employs 780 people. It is one of Carroll County's largest employers.</p>
<p>Republican Delegate Justin ready told WBAL News that, "from the corporate perspective it looks like a pretty good deal. They (Jos. A. Bank) got the asking price they wanted for their company."</p>
<p>Ready says he is concerned about the future of the Carroll County headquarters.</p>
<p>Neither Getty nor Ready say they have received any briefing from the company on the deal.</p>
