<p>In a saga going back to last autumn, Men’s Wearhouse Inc. (NYSE: MW) announced Tuesday morning that it has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (NASDAQ: JOSB) in an all-cash deal for $65.00 a share, or total consideration of $1.8 billion. The final price is $1.50 per share more than Men’s Wearhouse offered in late February.</p>
<p>The story began last October when the smaller Jos. A. Bank offered to acquire Men’s Wearhouse for $48 a share, an offer that was rejected and soon withdrawn. Then Men’s Wearhouse offered $55 a share to acquire Jos. A. Bank. As part of that offer, Men’s Wearhouse said that it “expect[ed] a smooth integration as there will be no rebranding or remodels required — Jos. A. Bank’s store banner will remain in place. Management will consist of the most qualified individuals from both companies.”</p>
<p>In the final deal, Men’s Wearhouse kept its bargain, saying there will be no re-branding and that management “will consist of the most qualified individuals from both companies.” The combined stores will have more than 1,700 locations and pro forma revenue of about $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>Men’s Wearhouse’s offer represents a premium of 56% to Jos. A. Bank’s closing price when the smaller store first made its offer for Men’s Wearhouse. Jos. A. Bank has terminated its agreement to acquire Eddie Bauer as a condition of the merger, which could result in a claim from Bauer’s owner, Everest Holdings. Jos. A. Bank also terminated its previously announced tender offer to purchase up to $300 million worth of its outstanding stock.</p>
<p>The Men’s Wearhouse tender offer to Jos. A. Bank stockholders has been extended to a new expiration date of March 19, and the cash paid per share has been raised from $63.50 to $65.00. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, pending required regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Men’s Wearhouse stock was up about 5.6% at $57.54, after posting a new 52-week high of $58.80 earlier in the morning. The 52-week low is $28.95.</p>
<p>Jos. A. Bank shares were up about 3.8% to $64.15, after posting a new high of $64.63. The 52-week low is $38.36.</p>
