<p>“The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it,” said a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority.</p>
<p>Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.</p>
<p>“The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,” he said.</p>
<p>A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.</p>
<p>A government source and a spokesman for Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel's escape when contacted by AFP.</p>
<p>Libyan authorities had said late Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for ex-rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.</p>
<p>Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading Al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.</p>
<p>Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil but the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, is the first to actually do so.</p>
<p>The standoff at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.</p>
