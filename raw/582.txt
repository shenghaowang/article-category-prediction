<p class="speakable"> While the <a href="/2014/03/06/investing/bull-market-five-years/index.html" target="_blank">current bull market</a> is already longer than average, most market strategists expect stocks to have another <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/06/investing/stock-market-predictions/?iid=EL">good year in 2014</a>. Stocks gained last week, with the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/?iid=H_MKT_Data">S&amp;P 500</a> hitting new highs, despite the ongoing <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/07/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">crisis in Ukraine</a>. The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/?iid=H_MKT_Data">Dow Jones industrial average</a> is less than 1% away from its all-time high. </p>
<p class="speakable"> But with little economic and corporate earnings news on tap this week, it may be tough for stocks to move much higher. So instead of our usual preview of the days ahead, we've decided to take a look back at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks of the past five years. </p>
<p> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/?iid=INV_Sub"><span class="inStoryHeading">Related: Extreme greed is driving the market</span></a> </p>
<p> Online travel companies <span>Priceline</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PCLN&amp;source=story_quote_link">PCLN</a></span>)</span> and <span>Expedia</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=EXPE&amp;source=story_quote_link">EXPE</a></span>)</span> are two of the biggest winners of the bull market. Priceline shares have surged 1,646% and Expedia has soared 1,182% during the past five years. </p>
<p> Fast-growing consumer stocks have also done well, including <span>Chipotle</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CMG&amp;source=story_quote_link">CMG</a></span>)</span>, <span>Whole Foods</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=WFM&amp;source=story_quote_link">WFM</a></span>)</span> and <span>Starbucks</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&amp;source=story_quote_link">SBUX</a></span>)</span>. <span>Wynn Resorts</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=WYNN&amp;source=story_quote_link">WYNN</a></span>)</span>, the casino company, and <span>Netflix</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NFLX&amp;source=story_quote_link">NFLX</a></span>)</span> were big winners as well. Those stocks also gained at least 1,000%. </p>
<p> Big tech companies <span>Apple</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link">AAPL</a></span>)</span> and <span>Amazon</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link">AMZN</a></span>)</span> had slightly less spectacular gains. They're in a group of stocks that have gained between 500% and 1,000% since March 2009. <span>Ford</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=F&amp;source=story_quote_link">F</a></span>)</span> and <span>Delta Airlines</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DAL&amp;source=story_quote_link">DAL</a></span>)</span>, two companies that were hit hard during the recession, are also among the companies that have far outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of nearly 180%. </p>
<p> But there were a few stocks that have been left behind. </p>
<p> <span>Avon Products</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AVP&amp;source=story_quote_link">AVP</a></span>)</span>, <span>Hewlett-Packard</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HPQ&amp;source=story_quote_link">HPQ</a></span>)</span> and <span>Cliffs Natural Resources</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CLF&amp;source=story_quote_link">CLF</a></span>)</span> were big laggards. <span>Best Buy</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BBY&amp;source=story_quote_link">BBY</a></span>)</span>, which was one of the best performers in 2013, is still up only 4% in the past five years. </p>
<p> And a few stocks actually missed the rally entirely. Shares of <span>Staples</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SPLS&amp;source=story_quote_link">SPLS</a></span>)</span>, which recently announced plans to <a href="/2014/03/06/news/companies/staples-store-closing/index.html" target="_blank">close hundreds of stores</a>, have fallen. <span>First Solar</span> <span>(<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FSLR&amp;source=story_quote_link">FSLR</a></span>)</span> shares are down 47% over the past five years, giving it the dubious distinction as the bull market's biggest loser. </p>
