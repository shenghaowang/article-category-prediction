<p>Shanghai/Hong Kong: China`s yuan eased against the dollar on Monday after the central bank doubled the currency`s daily trading band as part of its commitment to let markets play a greater role in the economy.</p>
<p>Yet the currency moved in a relatively narrow range reflecting market view that the People`s Bank of China will seek to limit currency swings at a time when markets fret over China`s cooling growth and the quality of corporate debt.</p>
<p>"The PBOC, with the help of major state-owned banks, will for certain tighten the grip on yuan`s value in coming days and weeks to prevent what it sees excessive volatility," said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the longer run, however, the central bank is expected to allow the currency to move in a broader range, reflecting its confidence that it can keep speculators at bay and that the economy was mature enough to handle greater uncertainty about the exchange rate.</p>
<p>"Over time, the widening will pave the way for the PBOC to gradually lessen intervention in daily trading and will help China`s reforms to make the yuan fully convertible eventually."</p>
<p>On Saturday, the People`s Bank of China doubled the yuan`s daily trading range, so that it can now rise or fall 2 percent around the daily midpoint rate. The currency opened at 6.15 to the dollar, just 0.29 percent to the weaker side of the official mid-point rate. It briefly fell to an intraday low of 6.1642, 0.2 percent weaker than Friday`s close.</p>
<p>Since the start of this year the yuan has lost 1.8 percent against the dollar, largely as a result of central bank`s efforts, reversing much of last year`s near 3 percent rise as Beijing sought to change the perception the yuan was a safe one-one appreciation bet.</p>
<p>Beijing`s efforts to clamp down on such trades combined with concerns over China`s economic health, are expected to keep the yuan on the back foot in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a Chinese company became the first to default on a corporate bond, and worries of slowing economic growth were highlighted by a dramatic 18 percent fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing.</p>
<p>"The weak economic data implies that it is unlikely to see CNY appreciation and capital inflows after the band widening, indeed the near-term bias could be the opposite," said Zhu Haibin, an analyst at JP Morgan in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the longer-run, the yuan could still find support in China`s sizeable current account surplus and its massive $3.8 trillion currency reserve war chest, but markets are less confident about the currency`s near term outlook.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank`s midpoint level fixed 0.04 percent firmer than Friday`s level and Monday`s opening trades suggested it was Beijing`s intention to keep markets guessing about where yuan would be heading.</p>
<p>"These rates are the first signs that the band widening may not point to any certain direction of yuan depreciation or appreciation," said a dealer at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Reflecting that heightened uncertainty, one-month implied dollar/yuan volatilities traded in the offshore market, perhaps the clearest indicator of how volatile the Chinese currency is expected to be over the next month, hit a record before easing slightly. </p>
