<p class="permalinkable" id="h0-p2">The U.S. Attorney’s office in New York has opened a criminal investigation into General Motors to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing on the part of GM stemming from the automaker’s faulty ignition switch recall last month</p>
<p class="permalinkable" id="h0-p3">The Justice Department is reportedly looking to whether General Motors broke any laws in the recall stemming from an ignition switch, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.</p>
<p class="permalinkable" id="h0-p4">The FBI has joined federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York in the probe.</p>
<p class="permalinkable" id="h0-p5">General Motors announced Wednesday that it is offering free loaner cars and $500 toward a new GM vehicle to more than a million owners of the compact cars that are being recalled. At least 13 people have died in accidents linked to the ignition-switch defect. CBS News’ reporting showed GM was aware of the problem years before the recall. On Tuesday, a congressional committee opened an investigation.</p>
