<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">In a possible sign of how consumers' mood has soured over a long, bitter winter, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell this month to its lowest level since November.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">The index reading was 79.9, down from 81.6 in February and 82.5 in December. Its most recent high was 85.1 in July.</p>
<p class="p-text">The weaker level, combined with the surprise 0.1% drop in producer prices for February also reported Friday morning, may both be at least partly weather related, said Michael Englund, of Action Economics.</p>
<p class="p-text">Consumer sentiment "faces headwinds from economic disruptions related to harsh winter weather, Obamacare, and lingering concerns after last year's mortgage rate spike and government shutdown," Englund said in an analysis after the report.</p>
<p class="p-text">He predicted the final reading later this month will show a smaller decline.</p>
<p class="p-text p-text-last" id="article-body-p-last">Weather has slowed the economy, holding back construction, manufacturing, business hiring and other activity, but economists are uncertain how much effect it has had. Many say it may take a couple months before a clear picture of the economy's real health emerges.</p>
