<p>On March 7, Chiquita dropped by 0.2% to close at $10.84 valuing the company in Charlotte, North Carolina at $508 million.</p>
<p>Chiquita at this time has operations in 70 countries that include the U.S. with brands likes Fresh Express and Chiquita Bananas. Fyffes operates in Asia, Europe and South and Central America.</p>
<p>The companies are planning to complete this transaction during 2014 pending the approval of shareholders as well as the Irish High Court.</p>
<p>The combined entity will target a fresh food business that is growing and trends health and wellness.</p>
