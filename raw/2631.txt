<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5em;">BOSTON
  (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who is betting
  $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year
  on lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to
  government documents filed in recent weeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent
  in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss
  company fought the billionaire investor's claims it runs a
  pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more
  for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the
  products outside the network.
</p>
<p>
  Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired
  three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New
  York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists,
  data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.
</p>
<p>
  In October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing
  Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.
</p>
<p>
  The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of
  Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton,
  specializes in Latino outreach.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities.
  Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens,
  which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife,
  echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month
  that it does not target members of minorities or low income
  communities.
</p>
<p>
  The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year
  with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers
  as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's
  fate.
</p>
<p>
  In the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
  Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward
  Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing
  on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut
  down illegal businesses before.
</p>
<p>
  SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of
  shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has
  previously probed whether statements made about a business are
  "materially false or misleading, including statements regarding
  the compensation levels."
</p>
<p>
  Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn
  nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife
  distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as
  an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said
  distributors results' depend on time, energy and dedication.
</p>
<p>
  Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to
  zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in
  the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent
  in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground
  however, falling 17 percent.
</p>
<p>
  Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former
  U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients'
  messages to the highest levels in Washington.
</p>
<p>
  The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler &amp;
  Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full
  service government affairs firm.
</p>
<p>
  During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on
  lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive
  Politics.
</p>
<p>
  Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey
  McGrath, which counted Boeing, Microsoft and Time Warner among
  its past clients.
</p>
<p>
  IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went
  to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to
  Glover Park Group.
</p>
<p>
  Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.
</p>
<p>
  Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to
  Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center
  for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this
  group. California's Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person
  the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe
  Herbalife is a Democrat.
