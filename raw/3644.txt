<p>March 10 (Reuters) - EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn’s two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting. </p>
<p>Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance. </p>
<p>The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP  employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards. </p>
<p>The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.” </p>
<p>EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.” </p>
<p>EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe. </p>
<p>The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring. </p>
<p>Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal. </p>
<p>The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company. </p>
<p>In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay. </p>
<p>“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said. </p>
<p>EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.” </p>
<p>“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said. </p>
<p>EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.</p>
