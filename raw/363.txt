<p>The Libyan parliament ousted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan on Tuesday and named the defence minister as caretaker premier until a permanent replacement has been approved, MPs said.</p>
<p>The vote of no-confidence in Zeidan came after a tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya broke through a naval blockade and escaped to sea despite his government’s threats to block it by force if necessary.<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_174357" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM.jpg"><img alt="Ali Zeidan: ousted after ship escapes with Libyan crude" class="size-large wp-image-174357" height="328" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src="http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM-504x331.jpg" srcset="http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM-504x331.jpg 504w, http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM-75x50.jpg 75w, http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM-495x325.jpg 495w, http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM-120x80.jpg 120w, http://s17350.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ali-zeidan-Libyan-PM.jpg 512w" width="500"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ali Zeidan: ousted after ship escapes with Libyan crude</p></div></p>

<p>“The Congress voted to withdraw its confidence in the prime minister by 124 votes,” MP Suleiman al-Zubi told AFP.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Abdullah al-Thani was named interim premier for the two weeks that General National Congress now has to agree on a permanent replacement, he added.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to bring down Zeidan had failed to win the required majority of 120 of the GNC’s 194 members.</p>
<p>all we keep hearing is crude oil theft! that is the slogan of the Nigerian Navy  and the federal govet. Only God will save Nigeria</p>
<p>A PM WAS REMOVED BECAUSE ONE TANKER ESCAPED WITH THEIR OIL.  WOW!!! NIGERIANS SHOULD LEARN FROM THE LIBYANS, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OIL TANKERS ESCAPE FROM NIGERIA WITHOUT PAYING FOR OUR OIL?</p>
<p>They call themselves Progressives from Libya to Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and want change in government, but do not have what it takes to govern their countries when they fraudulently oust the legitimate governments</p>
<p>This is what APC is intending to foist on Nigerians – no direction, ecstatic about useful and useful, fraudulent, used, corrupt fellows show up in their party in their party.</p>
<p>So they must kill others, main, destroy and steal to get onto office.</p>
