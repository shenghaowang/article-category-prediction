<p>DENVER (AP) — In the world’s first accounting of a recreational pot industry, Colorado officials say the state has made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, the first month of sales.</p>
<p>The tax total reported Monday by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.</p>
<p>The state legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. </p>
<p>Washington state sales begin in the coming months.</p>
<p>The taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. The first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction.</p>
<p>Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though not all were open in January.</p>
