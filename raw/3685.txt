<p>Low-wage jobs unexpectedly a way of life for many</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, many Americans followed a simple career path: Land an entry-level job. Accept a modest wage. Gain skills. Leave for a better-paying job.</p>
<p>The workers benefited, and the U.S. economy gained —better pay led to increased consumer spending, fueling growth.</p>
<p>But that path has narrowed as many of the next-tier jobs no longer exist. That means more lower-wage workers have to stay put. The resulting bottleneck is widening a gap between the richest Americans and everyone else.</p>
<p>It's part of why average inflation-adjusted income has declined 9 percent for the bottom 40 percent of households since 2007, even as incomes for the top 5 percent now exceed where they were when the recession began, according to the Census Bureau.</p>

<p>Official: Obama to push for more overtime pay</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama will direct the Labor Department to strengthen overtime pay protections for millions of workers, a White House official said.</p>
<p>The directive is meant to help salaried workers, such as fast-food shift supervisors or convenience store managers, who may be expected to work more than 40 hours a week without receiving overtime pay. The proposed change is part of Obama's effort to focus on closing the gap between the wealthy and the poor.</p>
<p>Under the new changes Obama is seeking, the Labor Department could raise the pay threshold for workers covered by overtime rules. Currently, salaried workers who make more than $455 per week are exempt from overtime.</p>

<p>Pfizer stock trades halted over drug patent ruling</p>
<p>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A federal court on Wednesday invalidated the key patent for one of Pfizer's most lucrative medicines, potentially opening the door for cheaper generic versions 18 months sooner than expected and cutting into the drugmaker's profit.</p>
<p>Pfizer Inc.,  still trying to make up for billions in lost sales since generic versions of Lipitor hit, could lose a couple billion more if the court decision on the Celebrex patent stands. The world's second-biggest drugmaker said it disagrees with the ruling and will "pursue all available remedies" to fight it, including an appeal.</p>
<p>Celebrex, Pfizer's fourth-bestselling product, brought in $2.9 billion in worldwide sales last year. The anti-inflammatory pill is widely used for arthritis and acute pain.</p>
