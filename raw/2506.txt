<p>Zillow is reporting this week that U.S. home buyers' monthly housing costs are growing rapidly as mortgage rates have risen significantly since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The Mortgage Bankers Association expects to see $1.24 trillion in purchase mortgage originations in the U.S. during 2019 - a 4.2 percent increase from 2018. MBA anticipates refinance originations will continue to trend lower next year, decreasing by 12.4 percent to $395 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. mortgage applications for new home purchases increased 8.2 percent compared to September 2017. Compared to August 2018, applications decreased by 9 percent. This change does not include any adjustment for typical seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>According to a housing and economic forecast released today by the California Association of Realtors, a combination of high home prices and eroding affordability is expected to cut into housing demand and contribute to a weaker housing market in 2019.</p>
<p>Based on new research by Zillow, housing affordability across the U.S. is especially tough in the nation's urban areas, but in the country's largest metros it's often the suburbs that are the least affordable.</p>
<p>Over 57,002 homes in the Florida Gulf Coast with a reconstruction cost value (RCV) of approximately $13.4 billion are at potential risk of storm surge damage from Hurricane Michael.</p>
