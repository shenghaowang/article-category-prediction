<p>Candy Crush Saga creator King Digital Entertainment said it could be worth as much as $7.6 billion in its highly-anticipated initial public offering, French news agency AFP reported.</p>
<p>The London-based developer has said last month that it intended to list on the New York Stock Exchange. It has already priced the 22.2 million shares it plans to <a href="http://amzn.to/2hmNVVO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sell</a> at anywhere from $21 to $24 per share, giving it a market capitalization of anywhere from $6.6 billion to $7.6 billion, the report said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a statement, King said that their estimated net proceeds from the IPO is $326 million. The developer added, "We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions."</p>
<p>The most popular game by the developer is Candy Crush which, according to digital research and consultancy firm IDATE, amasses daily sales of $850,000. The very addictive game, which now records 700 million sessions each day, merely began as a game on Facebook. The object of the game is simply to move sweets in a grid so that the user can get at least three sweets of the same kind in a row. Although the game itself is <a href="http://amzn.to/2gKrif6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free</a>, those who do use it can opt to pay for extra help so that they can pass through the game's over 500 levels, the report said.</p>
<p>VentureBeat reported that the Candy Crush Saga is largely credited for the growth of King's revenues. Last year, King posted profits of $568 million on revenues of $1.88 billion mostly because of the popularity of the game.</p>
<p>The planned IPO of King is the newest in a spate of Internet and gaming companies going public in the past three years. The most popular of these public debuts are that of social media platform Facebook and micro-blogging site Twitter, the report said.</p>
