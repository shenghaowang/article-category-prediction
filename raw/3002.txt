<p> Colorado, the first US state to legalise cannabis for recreational use, made just over $2 million in tax revenue from selling the drug in January, according to its first officially released figures. </p>
<p> The amount was not far behind the $2.7 million the state recouped in excise taxes on alcohol in the same period and is expected to exceed that in subsequent months. </p>
<p> More than $14 million worth of the dug was sold over counters to recreational users in the 30 days after cannabis shops opened on Jan 1. </p>
<p> Another $1.5 million in tax was collected from medical sales of the drug, the figures showed. </p>
<p> The total appeared low in comparison with recent estimates from Governor John Hickenlooper’s office that suggested the state should expect $117.8 million in tax revenue from recreational sales in the next fiscal year. </p>

<p> However, only 24 cannabis businesses were open on Jan 1, and 59 by Jan 31. The number has now risen to 167 and will expand further. </p>
<p> Barbara Brohl, head of Colorado’s tax department, said: “The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations. We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.” </p>
<p> Other US states, and countries around the world, have been closely observing the Colorado experiment which has been described as the world’s first fully regulated recreational cannabis market. </p>
<p> The Netherlands has legal sales of cannabis but does not allow growing or distribution, and Uruguay’s legalisation program is still under development. </p>
<p> In Colorado the first $40 million in tax revenue will go towards school construction and Mr Hickenlooper wants additional revenue to be used for projects including anti-drug advertising aimed at children, campaigns against driving under the influence of cannabis, and public health projects. </p>
