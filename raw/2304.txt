<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery held in a range between $1,338.10 a troy
ounce and $1,352.80 an ounce.</p>
<p>Gold last traded at $1,349.40 an ounce during U.S. morning
hours, up 0.59%, or $7.90. Gold futures advanced 0.25%, or $3.30 an
ounce, on Monday to settle at $1,341.50.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Prices were likely to find support at $1,319.30 a troy ounce,
the low from February 28 and near-term resistance at $1,355.00, the
high from March 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver for May delivery rallied 1.15%, or $0.23
cents, to trade at $21.14 a troy ounce. Silver ended Monday's
session down 0.09%, or $0.01 cents, to settle at $20.91 an
ounce.</p>
<p>Silver futures were likely to find support at $20.61 a troy
ounce, the low from March 10 and resistance at $21.61, the high
from March 7.</p>
<p>Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension
over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have
heightened demand for safe haven assets.</p>
<p>Russia said the U.S. had turned down an invitation to hold new
talks on resolving the Ukraine crisis, the latest instance of
attempts of finding a diplomatic solution stalling.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery inched
up 0.1% to trade at $3.033 a pound.</p>
<p>Copper plunged to an eight-month low of $2.995 a pound on
Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy
dampened demand for growth-linked assets.</p>
<p>Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February.</p>
