<p>Colorado collected slightly more than $2 million in taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana in the month of January, according to new figures released by the state Monday.</p>
<p>The numbers are the first official tally of the historic January sales, themselves a nationwide first. If the figures remain at that pace, sales and tax revenues would fall below  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25185649/hickenlooper-expects-marijuana-tax-money-exceed-prior-expectations" target="_top"> previous estimates of what

Colorado could reap from the sale of marijuana.</p>
<p>In January, Colorado  <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Revenue-Main%2FXRMLayout&amp;cid=1251633259746&amp;pagename=XRMWrapper" target="_blank">collected $1.4 million</a> from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana, plus another $416,690 from the state's standard 2.9 percent sales tax, according to a news release Monday from the Colorado Department of Revenue. Extrapolating from those figures, recreational marijuana businesses did slightly more than $14 million in retail sales during the month.</p>
<p>Most of the tax revenue came from stores in Denver, and the city reported it collected $616,282 in local sales taxes from recreational marijuana sales in January. In addition, the state will share $128,586 with the city from statewide collections.</p>
<p>Recreational marijuana businesses paid $195,318 in excise tax during January, which will be put toward school construction.</p>
<p>In total, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January

<p>Both Gov. John Hickenlooper's  <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1251943287907&amp;ssbinary=true" target="_blank">budget office</a> and  <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1251902171631&amp;ssbinary=true" target="_blank">legislative analysts</a> have predicted recreational sales for the first six months of 2014  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25233026/colorado-lawmakers-cautious-marijuana-tax-revenue-proposals" target="_blank">would top $190 million</a>.</p>
<p>The industry's swelling ranks — plus a state rule that exempted some early marijuana transfers from excise tax — mean monthly tax totals may rise as the year goes on. Barbara Brohl, head of the state Department of Revenue, said it could be April before collections stabilize.</p>
<p>"We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts," she said in a statement.</p>
