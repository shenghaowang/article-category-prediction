<p>China will not give up its efforts in searching for a missing Malaysia Airlines flight with 154 Chinese aboard "as long as there is a glimmer of hope," Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday.  <em><strong><a href=" http://www.ecns.cn/z/2014/SearchforMissingMalaysianAirliner/index.html " target="_blank">[Special coverage]</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Li made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session.  <em><strong><a href="http://www.ecns.cn/z/2014/2014NPCCPPCC/index.html" target="_blank">[Special coverage]</a></strong></em></p>
<p>"We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found," he said. "We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images."</p>
<p>He said that the Chinese government has asked all relevant parties in the ongoing massive international search to enhance coordination to investigate the cause and to locate the missing plane as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Flight MH370 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members vanished on March 8 on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing after losing contact with air traffic control in waters between Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The international search for the missing flight, which has so far involved at least 40 ships and nearly 40 aircraft from 12 countries, entered its sixth day Thursday, but the whereabouts of the Boeing 777-200 remains unknown.</p>
