<p>Investing.com - Gold futures edged lower on Friday, as investors
awaited the release of highly anticipated U.S. nonfarm payrolls
data later in the trading session and as they were still digesting
comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on
Thursday.</p>
<p>
<br/>

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery traded at USD1,349.60 a troy ounce
during European afternoon trade, down 0.16%.</p>
<p>The April contract settled 0.29% higher on Thursday to end at
USD1,331.8 a troy ounce.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,331.40 a troy
ounce, Thursday's low and resistance at USD1,355.00, the high from
March 3.</p>
<p>Market players were looking ahead to a highly-anticipated
nonfarm payrolls report for February, after job growth came in
below expectations in December and January.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of
individuals filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 26,000 last
week to a seasonally adjusted 323,000 from the previous week's
revised total of 349,000.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 11,000 to
338,000 last week.</p>
<p>In the euro zone, the ECB on Thursday held its benchmark
interest rate at a record low 0.25%, in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Speaking at the ECB's post-policy meeting press conference,
Draghi reiterated that euro zone borrowing costs will remain at
their present or lower levels until conditions improve.</p>
<p>Draghi said that the bank was monitoring money markets closely
and that it is determined to take decisive actions if required.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for May delivery tumbled 0.95% to
trade at USD21.368 a troy ounce, while copper for May delivery dove
2.38% to trade at USD3.142 a pound.</p>
