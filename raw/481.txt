<p> Gold futures ended higher for a second straight session on Tuesday, as <span class="landLinks"><a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/Markets.aspx">markets</a></span> continued to closely monitor the tussle between Russia and the West over Ukraine, even as the crucial referendum in Crimea comes up for vote next Sunday to determine the status of the region. The referendum will decide if people in the Crimea region would prefer to stay with Ukraine or join Russia. </p>
<p>Gold prices also found support on renewed safe haven buying, as investors continued to mull over some weak Chinese trade data which suggests the sluggishness in the nation's <span class="landLinks"><a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/EconomicNews.aspx">economy</a></span> may be more than initially envisaged.</p>
<p>The ongoing tension in Ukraine continued with the country's parliament warning the Crimean assembly that it would be dissolved if the referendum slated for Sunday takes place, which calls for the region to join Russia. The Crimean assembly has been given time until Wednesday to stop the referendum.</p>

<p>In economic news, wholesale inventories in the U.S. rose more than expected in January, a report from the Commerce Department showed Tuesday, notwithstanding a steep drop in wholesale sales. Wholesale inventories climbed 0.6 percent in January following an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in December. Economists expected inventories to rise by 0.4 percent compared to the 0.3 percent growth originally reported for the previous month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said wholesale sales tumbled 1.9 percent in January after inching up 0.1 percent in December. The drop was partly due to a 3.2 percent decrease in sales of non-durable goods, which edged up by 0.2 percent in the previous month.</p>
<p>From Europe, industrial production growth in U.K. slowed more-than-expected in January as severe weather conditions hampered oil production in the North Sea, data from the Office for National Statistics showed Tuesday. Nonetheless, manufacturing output topped expectations with broad-based expansion in most sub-sectors offsetting sharp contraction in pharmaceutical products. U.K.'s industrial output in January edged up 0.1 percent from December. The output was forecast to expand 0.2 percent, following December's 0.5 percent rise.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan on Tuesday refrained from initiating additional easing ahead of the planned sales tax hike in April that could dent the moderate recovery.
