<p>2015 Mercedes-Benz S500 Plug-In Hybrid</p>
<p>
Speaking with the <a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/Mercedes-to-build-all-electric-S-Class-2014-03-05"><em>Top Gear</em></a> website at the recent 2014 Geneva Motor Show, Dr. Uwe Ernstberger, the man in charge of Mercedes’ large car program, said that while there were no plans for an electric S-Class right now, one would be launched in the future.</p>
<p>
The key factor holding back Mercedes from launching an electric S-Class are the required batteries.</p>
<p>
"We have to work on the capacities of the batteries to get a better package in the car," Ernstberger explained. "You do not want to lose all the comfort features of an S-Class for transporting a battery only.”</p>
<p>
Mercedes has demonstrated a major commitment to the electrification of the car, so Ernstberger’s comments about an all-electric S-Class shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. The automaker has already offered an electric car for several years <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1064973_2012-smart-fortwo-electric-drive-2011-frankfurt-auto-show-preview">through its Smart brand</a>, and in 2012 we saw it launch the insane <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1079443_2014-mercedes-benz-sls-amg-electric-drive-debuts-in-paris">SLS AMG Electric Drive</a>. On top of this, an <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1083220_2014-mercedes-benz-b-class-electric-drive-debuts-in-new-york">electric B-Class</a> has just been launched and Mercedes has said it was open to <a href="//www.motorauthority.com/news/1088134_daimler-wants-more-from-tesla-stake-new-electric-mercedes-compact-in-the-works">working more closely with Tesla</a>, which it has a stake in.<em><p>
