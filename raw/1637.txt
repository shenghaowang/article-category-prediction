<p>
	"The parliamentary factions are meeting. There is a consensus on bringing down the government. We are going to put it to the vote shortly," MP Suad Gannur told AFP.</p>
<p>
	"The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," she added.</p>
<p>
	Zeidan's government has been repeatedly criticised for its failure to rein in the myriad of former rebel militias which have carved out their own fiefdoms since the NATO-backed uprising that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.</p>
<p>
	The prime minister was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital last October.</p>
<p>
	But in a new humiliation for his government, a North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in the east slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea earlier Tuesday.</p>
<p>
	The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.</p>
<p>
	Zeidan's government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.</p>
<p>
	Zeidan, an independent elected with the support of liberals, has been the target of previous no-confidence motions in the General National Congress but they have never achieved the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members.</p>
<p>
	Zeidan accuses his Islamist opponents of seeking to oust him solely to replace him with their own candidate.</p>
