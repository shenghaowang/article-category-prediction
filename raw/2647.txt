<p>This website has previously criticized the excessively high marijuana taxes levied in Colorado and Washington State – the first two states to legalize pot.</p>
<p>“If individuals want to grow marijuana on their own private property – and smoke it in a manner that doesn’t infringe on others people’s liberties – then they should be able to do so free from any government taxation,” we <a href="https://www.fitsnews.com/2013/10/24/taxing-pot-to-death/">wrote</a>. “Meanwhile if they want to sell their pot to others, they shouldn’t be forced to pay anything beyond the regular state sales tax.”</p>
<p>“Decriminalizing pot is not enough … it needs to be taxed fairly, not taxed to death,” we concluded.</p>
<p>Of course that’s not happening in left-leaning Colorado – where an assortment of levies raked in $2 million in tax revenue from recreational marijuana sales in January, the first month pot was legal (for purchases up to an ounce).</p>
<p>Bizarrely, Colorado will spend much of its pot revenue on government programs aimed at … you guessed it … keeping young people away from pot.</p>
<p>Sheesh …</p>
<p><em>Are these elected officials high?</em> Wait … don’t answer that.</p>
<p>Excessive tax rates – as well as government-mandated limitations on purchase size – do <em>not</em> represent the free market at work. And on top of that Colorado is plowing its resources into <em>demand reduction</em>? This system is rigged for pot legalization to fail … forcing consumers back into the black market economy (where government makes nothing).</p>
<p>We have never believed the prospect of government revenue was a good reason to legalize anything (drugs, gambling, prostitution … you name it). Government has more than enough money to perform its core functions.</p>
<p>These things should be legal because America is – or at least is supposed to be – a free market, where individuals are permitted to buy and sell what they wish (including themselves) up to the point such transactions compromise another’s liberty.</p>
