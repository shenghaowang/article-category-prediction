There may have been a bit of fresh safe-haven buying enter the gold market Monday, as news reports said more Russian troops were moving into Ukraine. <a data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.kitco.com/finance/futures/details.html?j1_module=futureDetail&amp;popup=1&amp;j1_symbol=GCJ14&amp;j1_override=&amp;j1_region=" href="http://www.kitco.com/finance/futures/details.html?j1_module=futureDetail&amp;popup=1&amp;j1_symbol=GCJ14&amp;j1_override=&amp;j1_region=" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">April gold </a>was last up $2.70 at $1,341.00 an ounce.
