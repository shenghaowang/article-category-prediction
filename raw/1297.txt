<p>Another round of recallsâthis time, thoughtfully reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/gm-knew-about-ignition-issues-10-years-before-issuing-recall/">before a decade went by</a>âcomes today from Chrysler, regarding anti-lock brakes on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango. The affected vehicles involved in this callback are more than 25,000 sport-utilities produced in the 2012 and 2013 model years, of which nearly 19,000 are located in the United States.<!--more--></p>
<p>According to a statement from the <i>conglomerato </i>in Auburn Hills, âcertain aggressive braking maneuversâ were made more vulnerable by restriction in the flow of brake fluid to the anti-lock brake system. While Chrysler states that neither brake function was lost nor was it out of compliance with regulation, the pedal feel under such circumstances âwas not consistent with customer expectations.â</p>
<p>The manufacturer assures that neither death nor injury has yet resulted in these vehicles, which were fitted with the brandsâ Ready Alert Braking.Â Ready Alert Braking is an active-braking system that functions by priming the brakes for optimal response during sudden stops.</p>
<p>Service dates for the affected sport-utes, which comprise a single-digit percentage of total SUVs sold by both brands in those model years, will be announced soon. This announcement differs from Jeepâs <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/after-initial-dispute-chrysler-and-nhtsa-agree-to-non-recall-inspections-of-1-56-million-jeeps/">erstwhile campaign</a> to recall and repair 1.56 million 1993â1998 Grand Cherokees and 2002â2007 Liberty sport-utes.</p>
