<p>Before dawn this morning, US Navy commandos boarded and took control of a North Korean-flagged tanker loaded with crude oil smuggled out of Libya, the Pentagon has confirmed.<div id="tpd-box-ad-am">

            if (TPD_Mobile == true) {
            googletag.cmd.push( function() {

<p>The move foils attempts by a breakaway Libyan militia to sell the cargo, which is owned by the Libyan government’s National Oil Company, on the black market. It’ll now be returned to Libyan authorities.</p>
<p>The oil was loaded on at the rebel-held port of Sidra, where the tanker’s been docked. Local daily al-Wasat report last week that the ship has $36m of crude oil on it.</p>
<p>Sidra is currently under the control of Ibrahim Jadran, the 32-year old warlord with a history in oil.</p>
<p>Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan had ordered an attack on the North-Korean-flagged tanker, but his failure to stop the activity saw him sacked by the country’s Islamist-led congress last Tuesday; he then fled to Europe.<div id="tpd-box-ad-bm">

<p>Pentagon Press Secretary Rear <a href="http://www.cityam.com/company/admiral-group">Admiral</a> John Kirby said in a statement today that nobody was hurt "when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans.”</p>
<p>North Korea has denied providing authorisation for the action. News reports have said it was being operated by a company based in Egypt, and was in the Mediterranean looking for buyers for the oil.<br/> </p>
