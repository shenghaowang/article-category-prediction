<p>Wondering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/25/mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-offline/">where your Bitcoins are</a>? Looks like Mt. Gox is giving you an official way to check. The fallen Bitcoin exchange has updated its homepage with a sparse login screen, inviting users to sign in and check their wallet's balance -- with a caveat. "This balance confirmation service is provided on this site only for the convenience of all users," the site warns. "Confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure... ...and should also not be considered an acknowledgement by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users."</p>
<p>That legalese is referring to Japan's Civil Rehabilitation Law and Mt. Gox's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/28/mt-gox-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">bankruptcy proceedings</a>, which are counting the company's assets to suss out a liquidation value. Mt. Gox users with Bitcoin stuck in limbo may eventually get a percentage of their wallet's worth based on the official totals. It's not a particularly heartening disclaimer, but at least it gives users a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/03/09/bitcoin-mark-karpeles-mt-gox-blog-hack-database/">verify their online wallets</a> without putting their <a href="http://blog.malwarebytes.org/cyber-crime/2014/03/bitcoin-malware-found-in-leaked-mt-gox-files/">accounts at risk</a>.</p>
