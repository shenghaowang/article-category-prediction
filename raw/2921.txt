<p>Somewhere in Silicon Valley, a billionaire has taken out $201 million in life insurance.</p>
<p>Guinness World Records, which announced the policy, said it is the largest ever issued.</p>
<p>Neither the record keeper nor the issuer would say who is covered by the massive policy.</p>
<p>Dovi Frances, the adviser who arranged the policy, would only say it went to a well-known technology billionaire from California.</p>
<p>The wealthiest of the wealthy buy life insurance for several reasons.</p>
<p>Primary among them are tax purposes, Frances explained.</p>
<p>A wealthy estate is hit with a hefty tax bill, and there may not be enough cash to cover it, since many millionaires and billionaires hold their wealth in investments, he said.</p>
<p>The $201 million policy is more complicated than most. It's underwritten by 19 different insurance companies, each with a slice of less than $20 million, he said. If a single lender took the whole policy, Frances said, "they would go into bankruptcy if the insurance policy is called."</p>
<p>And a big plan comes with a big cost. Frances said the price is "in the low single-digit millions."</p>
