<p>An archive containing transaction records from Mt. Gox that was released on the Internet last week by the hackers who <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2106200/mt-gox-ceos-blog-goes-blank-after-alleged-hack.html" target="_blank">compromised the blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles</a> also contains bitcoin-stealing malware for Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>Security researchers from antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab analyzed the 620MB file called MtGox2014Leak.zip and concluded that in addition to various Mt. Gox-related documents and data, it contains malicious binary files.</p>
<p><strong>[ Learn how to secure your systems with the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/browser-security-deep-dive?idglg=?ifwelg_fssr">Web Browser Deep Dive PDF special report</a> and <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/newsletters/subscribe?showlist=infoworld_sec_rpt&amp;source=ifwelg_fssr">Security Central newsletter</a>, both from InfoWorld. ]</strong></p>
<p>The files masquerade as Windows and Mac versions of a custom, back-office application for accessing the transaction database of Mt. Gox, a large bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Japan in late February after claiming it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins to cyber  thieves.</p>
<p>However, they are actually malware programs designed to search and steal Bitcoin wallet files from computers, Kaspersky security researcher Sergey Lozhkin said Friday in a <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/8196/Analysis_of_Malware_from_the_MtGox_leak_archive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Both the Windows and Mac binaries are written in LiveCode, a programming language for developing cross-platform applications.</p>
<p>When executed, they display a graphical interface for what appears to be a Mt. Gox database access tool. However, in the background they launch a process -- TibanneSocket.exe on Windows -- that searches for bitcoin.conf and wallet.dat files on the user's computer, according to Lozhkin. "The latter is a critical data file for a Bitcoin crypto-currency user: if it is kept unencrypted and is stolen, cyber criminals will gain access to all bitcoins the user has in his possession for that specific account."</p>
<p>The malware, which Kaspersky has named Trojan.Win32.CoinStealer.i (the Windows version) and Trojan.OSX.Coinstealer.a (the Mac version), uploads the stolen Bitcoin wallet files to a remote server that used to be located in Bulgaria, but is now offline.</p>
<p>"It seems that the whole leak was invented to infect computers with Bitcoin-stealer malware that takes advantage of people's keen interest in the Mt. Gox topic," Lozhkin said.</p>
<p>"Malware creators often using social engineering tricks and hot discussion topics to spread malware, and this is great example of an attack on a focused target audience," he said.</p>
<p>Users who downloaded the archive and executed any of the binary files inside should probably scan their computers with an anti-malware program and should take immediate steps to secure their bitcoins. According to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7703156e32c58fcec4736224e60c8dd45058dd204027c5b43d10d6718a622115/analysis/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a scan report Monday on the VirusTotal service</a>, 27 of 47 anti-virus engine detect the Windows binary file as malicious or suspicious.</p>
