<p>US employers have advertised slightly more jobs, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.</p>
<p>The Labor Department says employers in January posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 per cent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped four million since March 2008.</p>
<p>The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.</p>
<p>Total hiring slipped 0.9 per cent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly five million people are hired each month.</p>
