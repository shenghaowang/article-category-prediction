<p>Notably, respondents’ home price expectations climbed significantly in February—with 50 percent saying home prices will go up in the next year—following a measurable downturn in January, while the share of those who believe it is a good time to buy a home ticked up by 3 percentage points.</p>
<p>At the same time, those who believe that it would be easy to get a mortgage dropped 7 percentage points from January’s all-time survey high of 52 percent. Additionally, the share of respondents who say the economy is on the wrong track increased 3 percentage points to 57 percent in February, following a four-month decline. Despite a decrease in optimism across some of the indicators last month, consumer attitudes remain in generally positive ranges.</p>
<p>“Similar to the noisy economic and housing data published over the past few months, we’ve seen a corresponding increase in volatility in our survey results, particularly for home price expectations and perceptions about the ease of getting a mortgage,” says Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. “Weather may have played a role, as suggested by a 6 percentage point jump over the past two months in the share of consumers who say their household expenses are significantly higher than a year ago. This response would be consistent with higher home heating costs. Despite the volatile month-to-month changes, we believe that the housing recovery is continuing, but is not yet robust.”</p>
<p><strong>Homeownership Views</strong></p>
<p>According to the survey, the average 12-month home price change expectation increased from last month, to 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>The share of people who say home prices will go up in the next 12 months increased 7 percentage points to 50 percent, while the share who says home prices will stay the same decreased by seven percentage points to 38 percent.</p>
<p>The share of respondents who say mortgage rates will go up in the next 12 months increased by 1 percentage point, to 56 percent.</p>
<p>Those who say it is a good time to buy a house increased from last month, up 3 percentage points to 68 percent.</p>
<p>The average 12-month rental price change expectation increased from last month to 4.3 percent.</p>
<p>Results show that 51 percent of those surveyed says home rental prices will go up in the next 12 months, an increase of 3 percentage points from last month.</p>
<p>Forty-five percent of respondents thought it would be easy for them to get a home mortgage today, a 7 percentage point decrease from last month.</p>
<p>The share who says they would buy if they were going to move fell 4 percentage points to 66 percent, and those who say they would rent increased to 30 percent.</p>
