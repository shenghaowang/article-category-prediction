Jay Schottenstein, Interim CEO stated, "The Company's results in
2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have
persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall
customer experience fell short of expectations. We're taking steps
to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and
better engage our core customers. Our brands remain incredibly
strong and I'm confident in our ability to execute the strategic
plan and resume long-term profitable growth."

The company said that business conditions remain challenging, with
severe winter weather contributing to weak demand. Based on a high
single-digit decline in comparable sales, management expects first
quarter EPS to be approximately breakeven compared to adjusted EPS
of $0.18 last year. The guidance excludes potential asset
impairment and restructuring charges.
