<p>Stocks recovered off their worst levels to end narrowly mixed as
worries over the global implications of a slowing Chinese economy
dampened demand for risky assets, luring investors instead into the
safety of the U.S. government bond market. Blue chips
underperformed as a result of losses in Boeing (
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ba">BA</a>

) and the financial sector, but the Nasdaq Composite squeezed out a
very small gain, snapping a four-day losing streak. The S&amp;P 500
closed just in positive territory.</p>
<p>Global equities were undermined by the recent Chinese default
along with forecasts for more downbeat economic data tonight on
retail sales and industrial production. Coming on the heels of
bearish Chinese trade data, the impact a slowdown in the world's
second largest economy will have on Europe unnerved investors
across the globe, magnified by a four-year low in copper, an
industrial metal considered a barometer to Chinese manufacturing
activity.</p>
<p>In corporate news, reverberations from New Jersey's decision to
ban direct sales to consumers continued to undermine shares of
Tesla (
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla">TSLA</a>

), while investors bailed on General Motors (
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gm">GM</a>

) amid allegations by the Justice Department that the car maker may
have broken the law by ignoring an ignition defect for more than 10
years. Shares of Fannie Mae (
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fnma">FNMA</a>

) and Freddie Mac (
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fmcc">FMCC</a>

) tumbled following the decision by the Senate Banking Committee to
dismantle the government-owned mortgage lenders.</p>
