  The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm">January JOLTS
  report is out</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Job openings came in at 3.974 million, below the 4.015 million
  expected but up from December's revised print of 3.914 million.
</p>
<p>
  The hire rate and separation rate were basically unchanged at
  3.3% and 3.2%, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  The Bureau of Labor Statistics' "JOLTS Report" may not be as
  market moving as monthly nonfarm payrolls, but it does gives
  <a href="4%20Reasons%20To%20Follow%20JOLTS%20%E2%80%94%20Janet%20Yellen's%20Favorite%20Economic%20Report">
  key insights into the labor market</a> on hires, quits, layoffs,
  and job openings.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, the Federal Reserve's new chair Janet Yellen has cited
  JOLTS as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/janet-yellen-follows-the-jolts-report-2013-6">
  one of her favorite reports</a>. As the unemployment rate edges
  toward the Fed's targets over the next few years, JOLTS could
  possibly play a larger role when the central bank determines
  interest rate policy.
</p>
<p>It's JOLTS day.</p>
