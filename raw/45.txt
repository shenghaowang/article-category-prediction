<p>Malaysia Airlines says the co-pilot of the plane that disappeared 10 days ago spoke the last words from the cockpit - "All right, good night".</p>
<p>An unprecedented search operation has failed to find any trace of flight MH370, which investigators believe was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.</p>
<p>Suspicions of sabotage or hijacking heightened when officials revealed the final message, which came about the time two of the plane's crucial signalling systems were manually disabled.</p>
<p>During a press conference last night, Malaysia Airlines chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya was asked who had spoken the words.</p>
<p>"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot [Fariq Abdul Hamid] who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape," he said.</p>
<p>Officials said the last signal from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that sends back data on the plane's status - was received 12 minutes before the seemingly nonchalant final words.</p>
<p>The plane's transponder - which relays radar information on the plane's location - was switched off just two minutes after the voice message.</p>
<p>The sign-off went against standard radio procedures, which would have called for the pilot to read back instructions for contacting the next control centre and include the aircraft's call sign, said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways pilot and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his co-pilot have become a primary focus of the investigation into the fate of the missing Boeing 777-200ER.</p>
<p>On Saturday, police special branch officers searched the homes of both men in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials said detectives had been looking at any financial or personal pressures on the pilots, who had both passed psychological screenings to get their jobs. </p>
<p>Investigators were hunting for clues as to why someone on board the plane flew it perhaps thousands of kilometres off course.</p>
<p>It had not yet been ascertained who was controlling the aircraft when the communications systems were disabled.</p>
<p>Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, acting Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: "We are looking at it." </p>
<p>But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, background checks of the 239 passengers - among them six Australians - have drawn a blank.</p>
<p>What happened in the cockpit may remain unknown unless the plane is found, and finding it is a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>The search for the missing flight now involves 26 countries and covers a vast area from Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Australia <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-17/missing-flight-mh370-good-night-issued-from-plane-after-shutdown/5325816" target="_blank" title="">has been handed control of the southern Indian Ocean search</a> which began west of Perth early today.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Question Time today that the Air Force has so far completed two sweeps over the Indian Ocean and another is due to take place later in the day.</p>
<p>Mr Abbott says aircraft from New Zealand and the United States are also heading to the area, and soon there will be four RAAF Orion aircraft helping with the search. </p>
<p>"We owe it to the people on this ill-fated flight and their families to do what we can to solve this tragic mystery," the Prime Minister told Parliament.</p>
<p>China, France and the US were yesterday asked to provide more satellite data and Malaysia has also called for even more ships and planes to join the search.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, Andrew Herdman, says the search is "like trying to find a needle in Texas".</p>
<p>"At the moment you're looking for a needle in a football field, as someone in the American military said, or a needle in Texas, if you take the current zone," he told 7.30.</p>
<p>He believes the plane is likely to have taken a southern route.</p>
<p>"I would have thought the southern corridor was more likely on the grounds that if it had gone the northern route, it would have passed over a lot of land area and a lot of radar establishments ... [and] military radar would likely have picked something up," he said.</p>
<p>"And if the aircraft had landed or crash-landed anywhere on land in those areas, it's quite likely we'd have seen some sign of it or heard some evidence that that was what happened. </p>
<p>"If it took the other route and headed into the Indian Ocean, this is a vast expanse of sea and it'll be much more difficult to find signs as to what happened to the aircraft."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Malaysia's handling of the situation has attracted criticism, but Malaysia Airlines chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya says he is encouraged by the search effort.</p>
<p>"For the families, I understand that every day prolongs the anguish. I understand because Malaysia, too, is missing its sons and daughters. There were 50 Malaysians on board the plane," he said.</p>
<p>"Over the past two days, we have been recalibrating the search for MH370. It remains a significant diplomatic, technical and logistical challenge.</p>
<p>"Malaysia is encouraged by the progress made during such a short period of time. We are grateful for the response by the heads of government that we have spoken to, all of whom have expressed a commitment of assistance.</p>
<p>"With support from our many international partners, this new phase of the search is underway. Assets are being deployed, and search and rescue operations have begun. I wish to thank our partners from around the world for their continued support."</p>
