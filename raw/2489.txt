<p><strong>A merger between two of the biggest banana suppliers will help the companies save at least $40 million (£24 million) </strong><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">through logistics and procurement </strong><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">by the end of 2016.</strong></p>
<p>Irish fruit company <a href="http://www.fyffes.com/" target="_blank">Fyffes</a> and US firm <a href="http://www.chiquita.com/" target="_blank">Chiquita</a> will create the world's largest banana business with circa $4.6 billion (£2.8 billion) in annual revenues. The transaction to create ChiquitaFyffes will be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The two companies said they expect “annualised recurring before tax overhead and operational synergies of at least $40 million by the end of 2016”.</span></p>
<p>“These recurring annual synergies are anticipated to be comprised of efficiencies in the areas of logistics and procurement, among others,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The combined firm also plans to “broaden its geographic footprint and distribution channels” by expanding its global supply chain to improve product availability.</p>
<p>The statement added: “It will be well-positioned to build on each company's well-established presence in developed economies and further the progress both companies have made in expanding into high growth emerging markets worldwide.”</p>
<p>David McCann, Fyffes executive chairman, said: “We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”</p>
