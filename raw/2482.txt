<p><a href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone</a> has agreed to acquire Spanish broadband, phone and TV provider <a href="http://www.ono.es">Ono</a> in a deal worth £6 billion. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the autumn.</p>
<p>Ono currently has 1.9 million broadband customers, along with fixed-line telephone and pay-TV users.</p>
<p>Vittorio Colao, CEO of Vodafone Group, said “The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone. Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market. We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain”.</p>
