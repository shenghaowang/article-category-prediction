<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">MtGox boss Mark Karpeles has been targeted by hackers following the company's recent <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="/tech/news/a554661/bitcoin-exchange-mtgox-files-for-bankruptcy-protection.html">bankruptcy protection filing</a>.</p>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">The Bitcoin magnate's personal blog and Reddit account were breached, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.</p>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">The leaked material includes an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million transactions, entries from the firm's business ledger and details about its admin software.</p>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," said the hackers in a statement accompanying the data dump.</p>
<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">MtGox went dark last month after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around £210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole.</p>
