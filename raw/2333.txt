<p>Investing.com - U.S. stocks opened mixed on Tuesday, as marketn
sentiment began to recover after downbeat Chinese trade balance
data sent global equity markets broadly lower on Monday.</p>
<p>During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased
0.07%, the S&amp;P 500 inched up 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite
index rose 0.20%.</p>
<p>Markets were still jittery after data released over the weekend
showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in
February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a
rise of 10.6% in January.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.</p>
<p>The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy.</p>
<p>Sprint Corp. jumped 1.15% after SoftBank President Masayoshi Son
said he is ready to start a "massive price war" if U.S. regulators
allow Sprint to purchase T-Mobile US Inc.</p>
<p>Qualcomm Inc. added to gains, up 0.10%, after the provider of
mobile-phone chips promoted Derek Aberle to president, naming a
second-in-command to new Chief Executive Officer Steve
Mollenkopf.</p>
<p>On the downside, General Motors dropped 0.65% as a U.S. House
panel was set to investigate U.S. regulators and the company's
response to consumer complaints about ignition-switch failures that
led to the recall of 1.6 million vehicles and are linked to at
least 13 deaths.</p>
<p>In the retail sector, Urban Outfitters Inc. shares 4.43% after
the company said it expects poor weather to contribute to lower
sales and profit margins in the first quarter.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney surged 6.29% on the other hand after Citi upgraded
the department store chain to "buy" with a price target of $11.</p>
<p>In earnings news, American Eagle Outfitters projected
current-quarter earnings below market expectations, as the harsh
winter affected demand, sending shares in the teen-apparel retailer
down 5.21%.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed. The EURO
STOXX 50 added 0.19%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.24%, Germany's DAX
gained 0.60%, while Britain's FTSE 100 dipped 0.01%.</p>
<p>During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
inched up 0.02%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbed 0.69%.</p>
