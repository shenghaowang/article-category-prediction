<p>Franken matters because he sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee which, later this month, <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/can-comcast-be-trusted-company-report-says-it-exceeded-promises-in-nbcu-deal/">will hold hearings on the reported $45 billion deal that would give Comcast 30 million subscribers</a> in 43 of the nation’s top 50 markets — aka about 30% of pay TV customers. Franken reminded <em>CBS This Morning</em> anchors this morning he hadn’t been any too happy about the Comcast/NBCU merger either.<span id="more-696453"></span></p>
<p>Franken laughed when CBS News’ Senior Business and Economics Correspondent Anthony Mason brought up Comcast’s argument that it and <a data-tag="time-warner-cable" href="https://deadline.com/tag/time-warner-cable/" id="auto-tag_time-warner-cable">Time Warner Cable</a> don’t overlap in markets, explaining, “I’m laughing because we’re supposed to take great comfort from the fact that this is the No. 1 cable company and the No. 2 and they don’t compete in any market, so they’re saying you should be happy that we have these monopolies and now we’re going to be one company with twice as much of a monopoly.”</p>
