<p> Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said there may be more slack in the <span class="landLinks"><a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/EconomicNews.aspx">economy</a></span> than the bank estimated in February.</p>
<p>In testimony to the Treasury Committee, he said the Monetary Policy Committee ranged in the February Inflation Report that spare capacity was 1-1.5 percent. </p>
<p>"I personally would be at the upper end of that range and I would add that the margin, given the most recent employment report that we are probably slightly higher than that 1.5 percent," Carney told lawmakers.</p>
<p>However, policymaker Martin Weale said the slack in the economy is overstated.</p>
<p>Any unwinding of quantitative easing should occur after several adjustments in interest rates, Carney said. He said it is not unreasonable to raise rate to 2 percent to 2.5 percent over the next three years. </p>
