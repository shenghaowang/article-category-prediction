Revenue was up 8%, which topped expectations of analysts.</p>
<p>In Tuesday’s premarket trading the stock was up.</p>
<p>The company, which sells sporting goods and runs Golf Galaxy and its stores of the same name, earned over $138.6 million or a per share amount of $1.11, for the three month period ending February 1. That was up from $129.6 million or a per share amount of $1.03 for the same period one year ago.</p>
<p>The earnings were equal to Wall Street expectations. Revenue was up 8% to end the quarter at $1.95 billion from the same period one year ago of $1.81 billion. The revenue figures out did Wall Street expectations of $1.94 billion.</p>
<p>Dick’s share prices were up 67 or about 1.2% to just over $55 in early morning trading before the opening bell.</p>
<p>Sales at stores opened 13 months or more, an important gauge of the health of a retailer, were up by 7.3% when adjusted for last year’s extra week during the holiday shopping season. This metric excludes all results from stores that either have been opened or closes recently.</p>
<p>For the full year, Dick’s earned $337 million or a per share rate of $2.69 which was up from the previous year of $290.6 million or a per share rate of $2.31. Revenue was up by 6% to end the year at $6.21 billion compared to the $5.84 billion from last year. The increase was due to growth in same-stores and openings of new stores.</p>
<p>Sales at locations opened 13 months or more were up by 1.9%. Dick’s kept its 2014 earnings forecast in a range of between $3.30 and $3.08 a share. Analysts predict it will be $3.10 a share.</p>
<p>For its 2014 first quarter, the sporting goods chain is anticipating earnings of 51 cent to 53 cents a share. Wall Street is expecting the company to have earnings of 54 cents a share for that period.</p>
<p>Dick’s as of the end of the quarter had 558 stores in 46 states and 79 Golf Galaxy stores across 29 states.</p>
