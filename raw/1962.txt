  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl">AAPL</a>

  ) iPhone to include a digital tipping feature that will allow
  customers to leave tips at Strabucks baristas from the app.</p>
<p>Also, the company has included a new feature "Shake to Pay" to
  simplify mobile payments. The enhanced app will be available from
  Mar 19.</p>
<p>Nearly 11% of all transactions in a week in Starbucks' U.S.
  stores take place through smartphones.  With almost 10
  million customers currently using Starbucks mobile app, the app
  update will definitely improve customers' digital experience.</p>
<p>The recent iPhone app update is part of CEO Howard Schultz's
  plan to focus more on leveraging Starbucks' mobile and digital
  assets and loyalty and e-Commerce platforms to create more
  revenue streams.</p>
<p>Starbucks effectively uses social/digital media to drive
  customer awareness and thereby, improve traffic flow. A large
  number of its customers are opting for Starbucks card as the
  preferred mode of payment which bodes well for the company's
  future growth.</p>
<p>Starbucks' loyalty cards are gaining popularity and at
  present, nearly one-third of all the U.S. transactions are made
  by My Starbucks Rewards loyalty members. Together, mobile and
  Starbucks card payments represent over 30% of the total U.S.
  payments. At the end of first-quarter 2014, the company had 7
  million active members in the U.S.</p>
<p>The company is also witnessing an increased usage of My
  Starbucks Rewards in countries outside the U.S. like China, Korea
  and Canada. With the Jan 2014 launch of Starbucks gift card in
  China, these cards are now available in 28 countries.</p>
<p>Further, the company is trying to broaden the reach of the
  Starbucks loyalty and mobile platform to its channel development
  business and emerging brands. Starbucks customers can now earn
  reward points under My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program on
  purchase of packaged coffee at its grocery channels.</p>
<p>Further, customers can now use Starbucks cards as well as
  Starbucks mobile application at all Teavana stores and redeem
  stars for Evolution Fresh juices and other bottled Starbucks
  ready-to-drink beverages bought at Starbucks stores.</p>
