<p>Republicans know they can't just get rid of ObamaCare anymore</p>
<p class="p1">Since the start of the year, Republican leaders have insisted their party would soon put forward a health care alternative to ObamaCare. That day may almost be here, as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republican-leaders-craft-their-vision-for-an-alternative-to-health-care-law/2014/03/16/b98db274-ab7e-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html" target="_blank"><em>The Washington Post's</em> Robert Costa reports</a> the GOP leadership is finally unifying behind a conservative plan "in part to draw an election-year contrast" with Democrats and ObamaCare.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 75px;">The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 75px;">The tenets of the plan — which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations — are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills. [<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republican-leaders-craft-their-vision-for-an-alternative-to-health-care-law/2014/03/16/b98db274-ab7e-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html" target="_blank"><em>Washington Post</em></a>]</p>
<p class="p1">Coming after years of GOP threats to repeal ObamaCare and revert to the old health care system, the mere fact that the party may soon offer a true, unified alternative underscores how far the policy debate has shifted since the health care exchanges went live in October. With more than 4.2 million people having now enrolled in new insurance plans via ObamaCare, calling for repeal alone would mean advocating for those millions of newly insured to lose their coverage. And polls have consistently shown that the public's general opposition to the law does not translate into support for repeal. As <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/democrats-and-republicans-agree-on-obamacare.html" target="_blank">Jonathan Chait put it last week</a>, Republicans "have won the public relations war over ObamaCare, and they have lost the public relations war over repealing ObamaCare." <a class="author" href="/authors/jon-terbush"><em>Jon Terbush</em></a></p>
<p>Hundreds-strong migrant caravan stalls at southern Mexican border</p>
<p>A massive caravan of mostly Honduran <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hundreds-of-migrants-u-s-bound-caravan-cross-mexico-guatemala-border-2018-10-20/" target="_blank">migrants stalled</a> Friday and Saturday at Mexico's southern border while trying to make their way to the United States.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/19/americas/caravan-mexico-border/index.html" target="_blank">have said those</a> who meet entry requirements, like holding a visa, will be allowed through, but so far only a trickle — many women and children — have made it past the bridge checkpoint over the Suchiate River where hundreds waited overnight.</p>
<p>Police in riot gear have used tear gas and smoke <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/19/americas/caravan-mexico-border/index.html" target="_blank">to control</a> the crowd. Those permitted to apply for refugee status can stay in a shelter, but conditions on the bridge are rapidly becoming unsanitary.</p>
<p>President Trump <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/802942/first-estimated-4000-migrants-usbound-caravan-reach-guatemalamexico-border" target="_blank">has threatened</a> to close the southern border to keep the migrants out, but he agreed Thursday night to evaluate their asylum claims. At a rally in Arizona <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/803009/trump-slams-migrants-arizona-rally-country-doesnt-want" target="_blank">Friday evening</a>, Trump alleged "many of those people [in the caravan] — a fairly big percentage of those people — are criminals." </p>
<p>The group includes young children and pregnant women seeking to escape dire economic circumstances and even violence in their home countries. "We have suffered so much," one migrant mother on the bridge <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hundreds-of-migrants-u-s-bound-caravan-cross-mexico-guatemala-border-2018-10-20/" target="_blank">told CBS News</a>. "She has a fever and we brought nothing," she added, gesturing to her baby. <a class="author" href="/authors/bonnie-kristian"><em>Bonnie Kristian</em></a></p>
<p>Trump says immigration reform would take 'less than one hour' if Democrats would just cooperate</p>
<p>This whole immigration mess could be solved in a matter of minutes, President Trump claimed on Twitter Saturday morning, if those pesky Democrats would just do what he wants:</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together, we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. Look at the needless pain and suffering that they are causing. Look at the horrors taking place on the Border. Chuck &amp; Nancy, call me!</p>

<p></p>
<p>In past negotiations about specific immigration reform proposals, Trump has <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/755097/trump-veto-daca-bill-that-doesnt-match-immigration-goals-white-house-official-says" target="_blank">proven mercurial</a>, taking a variety of rapidly changing and inconsistent positions and <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/755529/gop-sen-lindsey-graham-rips-trump-administration-poisoning-well-immigration-reform" target="_blank">drawing critique</a> even from within his own party.</p>
<p>Several additional Saturday tweets saw Trump endorsing a pair of GOP candidates for the midterm elections. He praised <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis</a>, the would-be Republican successor to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1053662989272793089" target="_blank">Florida Gov. Rick Scott</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1053657849606234112" target="_blank">also backed</a> Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp in his gubernatorial race. Kemp is embroiled in <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/801332/georgias-gop-gubernatorial-nominee-also-runs-states-elections-voter-registration-controversially" target="_blank">controversy surrounding</a> his "exact match" system of maintaining voter registrations.

<p>Alaska Gov. Bill Walker suspends his re-election campaign</p>
<p>Alaska Gov. Bill Walker (I) announced Friday he and Lt. Gov. Valerie Davidson <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/412345-alaska-governor-walker-suspends-reelection-campaign" target="_blank">will not continue</a> their re-election campaign.</p>
<p>"With more time, I am confident that Val and I could deliver a message and a campaign that could earn a victory in this election," <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/19/politics/bill-walker-reelection-bid/index.html" target="_blank">he said</a>. "But there are only 18 days remaining before election day. Absentee ballots have already been mailed, and Alaskans are already voting. In the time remaining, I believe we cannot win a three-way race."</p>
<p>Davidson took office <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/411749-alaskas-lieutenant-governor-resigns-over-inappropriate-comments" target="_blank">Tuesday after</a> former Lt. Gov.

Walker, a former Republican, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/412345-alaska-governor-walker-suspends-reelection-campaign" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Democrat Mark Begich against Republican Mike Dunleavy. <a class="author" href="/authors/bonnie-kristian"><em>Bonnie Kristian</em></a></p>
<p>Remains of 63 infants found in Detroit funeral home</p>
<p>A week after the remains of 11 babies <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/801812/bodies-11-infants-found-ceiling-former-detroit-funeral-home" target="_blank">were found</a> in the ceiling of a shuttered Detroit funeral home, another 63 bodies of infants <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/19/fetuses-perry-funeral-home-detroit/1702594002/" target="_blank">were discovered</a> in a separate funeral home in the city.</p>
<p>So far, police say there is no apparent connection between the two facilities. The second funeral home has now been closed as well. "This is deeply disturbing," <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/19/fetuses-perry-funeral-home-detroit/1702594002/" target="_blank">said</a> Detroit Police Chief James Craig. "I have never seen anything like this."</p>
<p>Investigators <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-detroit-bodies/remains-of-more-than-60-babies-fetuses-found-stashed-in-detroit-funeral-home-idUSKCN1MU02Z" target="_blank">are working</a> to determine the identities of the infants as well as why they were not handled appropriately. One <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/19/fetuses-perry-funeral-home-detroit/1702594002/" target="_blank">theory suggests</a> the remains should have received a proper burial after donation for educational use at a nearby medical school.</p>
<p>While the first set of remains were uncovered thanks to an anonymous tip to state authorities, the second set came to light though a lawsuit against the funeral home alleging improper burial of an infant girl. <a class="author" href="/authors/bonnie-kristian"><em>Bonnie Kristian</em></a></p>
<p>Dozens were killed when a train plowed into a crowd in India</p>
<p>At least 60 people <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/train-mows-crowd-india-festival-58-dead-58625702" target="_blank">were killed and</a> dozens more injured when a speeding train plowed into a crowd of people watching fireworks at a religious festival in northern India Friday night.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses say the victims <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45913793" target="_blank">did not hear</a> the train coming over the booms of the fireworks display, and the train reportedly did not blow its whistle before striking the crowd. Locals say festival attendees sit on the tracks to watch the show every year.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences on Twitter:</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">Extremely saddened by the train accident in Amritsar. The tragedy is heart-wrenching. My deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones and I pray that the injured recover quickly. Have asked officials to provide immediate assistance that is required.</p>

<p></p>
<p>An inquiry into the accident is ongoing. The Railway Board <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45913793" target="_blank">rejected responsibility</a> on the grounds that people "are not expected to be on the tracks." <a class="author" href="/authors/bonnie-kristian"><em>Bonnie Kristian</em></a></p>
<p>U.S.-South Korean military exercise canceled to ease diplomacy with North Korea</p>
<p>The U.S. and South Korea on Friday <a href="ttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-south-korea-suspend-joint-military-exercise-because-of-north-korea-talks/2018/10/19/07990f06-d3c3-11e8-a275-81c671a50422_story.html" target="_blank">canceled plans</a> for a major joint military exercise previously set for December. The schedule change is intended to foster continued progress in diplomacy with North Korea.</p>
<p>"Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis and Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo decided to suspend Exercise Vigilant Ace to give the diplomatic process [with North Korea] every opportunity to continue," <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/19/politics/us-south-korea-suspend-exercise/index.html" target="_blank">said chief Pentagon</a> spokesperson Dana White. She also reported Japan was consulted before the decision was made, and said Mattis and Jeong have "pledged to maintain close coordination and evaluate future exercises."</p>
<p>North Korea has <a href="ttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-south-korea-suspend-joint-military-exercise-because-of-north-korea-talks/2018/10/19/07990f06-d3c3-11e8-a275-81c671a50422_story.html" target="_blank">long complained</a> of such exercises, calling them "war games." While meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore this past summer, President Trump agreed to suspend some exercises while denuclearization talks proceed. <a class="author" href="/authors/bonnie-kristian"><em>Bonnie Kristian</em></a></p>
<p>Trump slams migrants at Arizona rally: 'This country doesn't want them'</p>
<p>President Trump targeted his ire at migrants who want to come to the United States and the Democratic Party at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/this-country-doesnt-want-them-trump-rails-against-migrants-trying-to-enter-the-us/2018/10/19/1cbdd8de-d3ab-11e8-83d6-291fcead2ab1_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.20d7b39e909e" target="_blank">a campaign rally</a> in Arizona Friday night.</p>
<p>Referring to <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/802942/first-estimated-4000-migrants-usbound-caravan-reach-guatemalamexico-border" target="_blank">the caravan</a> of an estimated 4,000 people traveling on foot from Honduras to the U.S. border, Trump alleged "many of those people — a fairly big percentage of those people — are criminals."</p>
<p>"You think they're all wonderful people. You've got some bad people in those groups," <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/19/trump-arizona-2018-sinema-mcsally-918759" target="_blank">Trump said</a>. "You've got some tough people in those groups. And I'll tell you what, this country doesn't want them. Okay?" The caravan includes young children and pregnant women seeking to escape dire economic circumstances and even violence in their home countries.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-anybody-who-votes-democrat-now-crazy-n922361" target="_blank">president claimed</a> "cuckoo" Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote, along with "free welfare, free health care, and free education" and a luxury car, like a "Rolls-Royce, made not in America, so I hope that's not what we do." Polling <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/399016-poll-americans-overwhelmingly-reject-giving-voting-rights-to" target="_blank">shows a majority</a> of Americans in both major parties oppose allowing non-citizens to vote. <a class="author" href="/authors/bonnie-kristian"><em>Bonnie Kristian</em></a></p>
