<p class="News-brief-head1"> Herbalife notified of FTC inquiry </p>
<p class="News-brief-text">  Herbalife is facing an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission. The nutrition and supplement vendor said it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to comment. Herbalife said it welcomes the inquiry, noting a “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business. The company said it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully. On Tuesday, hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company. Ackman has repeatedly bet against the company and said he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme. Herbalife Ltd.'s shares plunged more than 12 percent when a suspension in trading was lifted. </p>

<p class="News-brief-text">  Federal prosecutors say a New York-based investment bank and broker-dealer has agreed to pay $25 million in penalties for misleading customers trading in residential mortgage-backed securities. The U.S. attorney's office in New Haven announced on Wednesday that as part of the non-prosecution agreement, Jefferies LLC will pay up to $11 million in restitution to victims and up to $4.2 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission. U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly said employees in Jefferies' fixed income division repeatedly misled their customers to boost their profits. Daly said management not only tolerated illegal practices but encouraged them. Jefferies has cooperated and implemented changes. A former Jefferies executive was convicted earlier of defrauding investment funds established as part of the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
