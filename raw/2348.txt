<p class="story-body__introduction">Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has announced plans for a flotation in the US, saying the move will make it "a more global company".</p>
<p>The move had been widely predicted by analysts, who expect it to be the biggest share offering by a tech firm since Facebook's flotation in 2012.</p>
<p>They predict that the listing will raise up to $15bn (£9bn).</p>
<p>However, Alibaba did not reveal when the initial public offering (IPO) would take place or on which exchange.</p>
<p>"Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States," <a class="story-body__link-external" href="http://www.alizila.com/alibaba-group-issues-statement-regarding-commencement-ipo-process">the firm's statement</a> said.</p>
<p>"This will make us a more global company and enhance the company's transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals."</p>
<p>The move is expected to benefit Yahoo, which owns a significant stake in Alibaba and could see the value of its investment rise considerably.</p>
<p>Speculation about a New York listing for Alibaba began last September, when the company abandoned plans for a stock offering in Hong Kong after talks with regulators broke down.</p>
<p>Alibaba's management structure, which allows senior executives to retain control of the board of directors, fell foul of Hong Kong's listing rules.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Stock Exchange chief executive Charles Li said in a statement: "We respect the company's decision and wish it well."</p>
<p>He added, in an apparent reference to Alibaba's insistence on maintaining its management structure: "We are proud of our tradition of respect for the rule of law and adherence to principles."</p>
<p>The Alibaba group is already the world's largest online retailer, with more than 500 million customers and more than 800 million product listings.</p>
<p>However, it is so far little known outside China. </p>
<p>The news comes two days after another Chinese tech giant, Twitter-like service Weibo, announced plans for a $500m US listing.</p>
