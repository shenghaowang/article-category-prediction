<p>The Australian dollar has lost ground as tensions about the Ukraine crisis and concerns about the Chinese economy weigh on market sentiment.</p>
<p>At 7am (AEDT), the local unit was trading at 90.18 US cents, down from 90.28 cents on Monday.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin's threat to invade Ukraine and take over the Crimea region after a pro-Russian government lost power last month has seen relations between Russia and Western nations continue to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Chinese import and export figures showed an unexpected trade deficit for February after exports fell 18.1 per cent.</p>
<p>Westpac New Zealand senior market strategist Imre Speizer said there seemed to be nothing for traders to be happy about at the moment.</p>
<p>"Markets adopted a slightly pessimistic posture following the weekend's weak China data and continuing tensions in Ukraine," he said.</p>
<p>"Otherwise, there was no fresh news of significance, limiting volatility overnight."</p>
<p>Mr Speizer said he doesn't expect the Australian dollar to fall too much further in the coming weeks, thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia's stable outlook for the cash rate.</p>
<p>"However, there remains a question mark around Australia's economy, with tension between strong business sentiment and weak consumer sentiment not expected to be resolved until the second half of this year," he said.</p>
<p>Local economic data of interest to markets on Tuesday include the National Australia Bank's monthly business survey for February.</p>
