<p>NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- EBay Inc. is rejecting the overtures of Carl Icahn, saying Monday that it would not put two of the financier's employees on its board. Icahn's employees, Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, were "not qualified candidates" because they did not have "relevant experience or expertise" and already served on a number of boards for other public companies, the eBay board said in a statement, which misspelled the last name of Ninivaggi. The eBay board also nominated four existing directors for re-election, including the company's president, John Donahoe. </p>
