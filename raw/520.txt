<p>The telecom sector of Canada is one of the most developed one in the world. Canada is ranked as the 21<sup>st</sup> largest country in the world in terms of internet users. There are approx. 32 million people in Canada that have internet access. It means that about 90% of the population of the country has internet access. The Canadians are the people that spent most of their time online. An average Canadian spend about 40+ hours per month online which is highest in the world. Most of the companies or the ISPs in Canada provide capped connections. There are some ISPs that provide unlimited internet downloading to their subscribers. The best part of such companies is that they offer the connection services throughout Canada.</p>
<p>The file sharing when it comes to the copyright material is completely illegal as per the Canadian law. Here comes the diversity of the internet which is a hot topic among the professionals. It is not possible for the authorities to eliminate the copyrighted material which is available on the internet. Such downloads are common in Canada and there are exceptions made to the law. The fair use policy will make sure that the users never land into issues at all. The Canadian authorities are working rigorously to make sure that the laws are defined clearly. It is because the fair use policy is clear for every download except music as the idea is very complex. It is expected that new laws and rules will be devised with the passage of time.</p>
<p>The main medium of communication in Canada is fiber optic. The last mile connectivity is something that the Canadian ISPs have in view before moving forward with the infrastructure build. The management of the network is being done by a constant upgrade by the companies that are spending millions to get the network better with every passing day. <a href="https://www.bell.ca/">Bell Canada</a>, Rogers Wireless, and <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/bc/internet/content/landing?adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.ua%2F&amp;adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D4DE596DA52DD4262-012D4A68FFBB281B%7CMCORGID%3D67A50FC0539F0BBD0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1530195604">Telus Internet</a> are the main providers in Canada and each company faces a cut-throat competition to get more subscribers. There are many small companies which are working in Canada to provide door to door access. These companies can purchase the network rights from the large companies. The internet is then supplied under their own brand name.</p>
<p>There are 760 large companies which provide the internet access to the people of Canada. The total number is 2000 as per some estimates. There are many hosting services which counts to a total of 7.77 million. The services which are provided by these ISPs are reliable and user-friendly. Still, Canada is ranked as a country which does not have reliable internet services as per international standards. The mobile phone companies have also captured the telecom sector of Canada. An average Canadian spends about $65 per month. There are 30 million mobile phone users in Canada. The 90% of the total subscribers are connected to the large networks. There are many regional networks which also support the overall infrastructure. The CRTC or Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is the sole authority to regulate wireless networks in Canada.</p>
<p>Canadians will soon need to pay more to watch <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/">series and movies on Netflix</a>. The company has raised the price of its plans for both new and existing users. While the rise has been already implemented for new subscribers, existing users will be notified through email before new rates are charged from them.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Netflix, the company cited addition of new content and introduction of new features and services as the reasons behind the price rise. It said that Netflix adjusts the pricing of its packages from time to time as they introduce new movies, exclusive TV series and upgrade their platform to offer better services to its customers.</p>
<p>The company has a huge database of content and also produces its own original content which has become popular like House of Cards. It also has a large number of movies sourced exclusively from international film festivals. Few of USA TV shows are also aired by Netflix in Canada like CW’s Riverdale and ABC’s Scandal.</p>
<p>Netflix has a growing market in Canada and in 2016 it had around 5.2 million subscriptions. The television streaming market is quite competitive in Canada and many leading names are fighting out with each other.</p>

<p>Brands like Amazon prime are quite a hit in the country having Canadian airing rights of highly rated shows such as American Gods and Mr. Robot. <a href="https://www.cbs.com/all-access/">CBS All Access</a> is also set to enter the Canadian market sometime in 2018 with its 9,000 episodes from various shows. The multiple numbers of competitors and the fight to acquire rights for shows has increased the acquisition cost of the content. Though Netflix did not mention it in their statement, still it is a situation faced by all companies in Canadian television industry.</p>
<p>Netflix increased their prices last year in May while introducing the feature of streaming in high quality on multiple devices. This time the increase has been $1 for the basic plan making it $8.99 per month. Users can only stream standard quality videos on a single device at a time. The cost of the standard plan has also gone up by $1 ($10.99 per month) which permits subscribers to access content on two screens. Subscribers of the premium plan now have to shell out a monthly $13.99, which is a $2 increase from the previous price. Users can view high definition 4k videos simultaneously on four screens with this plan.</p>
<p>The company changes its prices based on local market conditions in a country. The Australian subscribers had to pay few dollars more after Netflix raised the prices in June countering the increase in local taxes. It remains to be seen how the users will respond to the move.</p>
<p>TV streaming service in Canada will get a major boost next year with the introduction of CBS Corp’s CBS All Access service. It is the company’s bid to go international that prompted the move and gave Canada the first opportunity to enjoy its content.</p>
<p>The online streaming service in the US has a huge database of content and around 9,000 episodes from its various series. Viewers will also get access to special CBS channels like Showtime without requiring a cable connection. Apart from television activities, those who fond of games playing can try out online casinos, but don’t forget to check out reviews first.</p>
<p>CBS corp. has a good chance of creating a considerable grab on the market but it lacks on one ground. The copyrights of many of its shows are already purchased by Canadian broadcasters like Rogers Communications Inc., BCE Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc. So viewers will not get to see shows like Survivor or The Big Bang Theory and some of the shows are also aired on Netflix. The restricted content may impact the number of subscribers the company is expecting.</p>

<p>We have to wait and see as CBS predicts they are going to have 4 million subscriptions by the end of this year. It is interesting to note that TV viewership is declining in Canada and online streaming services are giving a tough competition to the traditional form. In 2016, the volume of subscribers reduced by 1% and reached 11.1 billion viewers and the revenue fell by 2% amounting to $8.7 billion, according to the data from <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/home-accueil.htm">Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, online streaming services have gained increased number of subscriptions. Netflix recorded a growth of 52 million viewers in US alone and another 52 million from all over the world. Compared to that, 158,000 people in Canada disconnected their cable service in 2015. It can be expected that the market is ripe for online streaming in Canada and other players like Hulu and HBO Go may join the competition in some years.</p>
<p>With so many providers in the game, the price is also a big factor in getting subscriptions. CBS did not reveal the rates they will charge in Canada, but in the US current rates are $5.99 per month. To get a commercial free version, viewers have to pay $9.99. If the rates are any higher, then Canadian may not be too interested in joining up considering the limitation of content.</p>
<p>Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS TV Network said that they were aware of the potential of online streaming judging the success of their competitors. The introduction of the service in Canada gives them the chance to directly reach the viewer on an increased scale which can be expanded globally. CBS All Access had achieved a growing domestic market and now is ready with their premium content to hit the international arena.</p>
<p>Auto insurance provider Intact Insurance in Nova Scotia <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/intact-insurance-mobile-phone-tracking-app-driving-habits-1.4247082">plan to use mobile apps</a> to track driver habits to determine the premium rates in the future. Based on the way one drives, they can be eligible for a 25% savings on their insurance premium!</p>
<p>The idea may sound out of a science fiction movie but the concept has existed for some time. Many companies like Intact Insurance offer a plug in dongles for vehicles which are used to track driver habits. Intact insurance revealed that the dongle program included 350,000 participants from all over the country. It was introduced at N.S in 2014.</p>
<p>However, they are not always the practical solution due to various reasons.</p>
<p>First is the cost that prohibits their universal use and in some cases, the devices are not returned to the company. They can also be lost adding to the cost of the company. Another reason is the dongles track the habits of any driver that gets behind the wheel and it is not possible to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>Mobile apps have many unique advantages that make them a pragmatic solution for the insurance companies. The app would be using the smart phone of the driver and eliminate any expense on part of the insurance provider. They will also be able to specifically track the habits of the insurance payer which is their priority. It will only monitor the main driver as the app will be linked to his mobile phone.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-9 size-full" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src="https://www.tele-management.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tracked-using-Mobile-Apps.png" srcset="https://www.tele-management.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tracked-using-Mobile-Apps.png 800w, https://www.tele-management.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tracked-using-Mobile-Apps-300x225.png 300w, https://www.tele-management.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tracked-using-Mobile-Apps-768x576.png 768w" width="800"/></p>
<p>The tool will be used to track aspects of sudden accelerations, hard braking, night driving utilizing the GPS feature of the phones. Intact Insurance applied for permission to launch the program from the <a href="https://nsuarb.novascotia.ca/">N.S Utility and Review Board</a> which was granted on August 4. The company plans to launch the service next month starting September. The initiative will be a way to reward drivers with good habits and give them lower insurance rates for their performance.</p>
<p>For the time being, the app or the dongle insurance rates are optional in Canada. But according to experts, a day may come when it automatically becomes more preferable considering the costs. With the advance of technology, the companies may increase the cost of the premium and people will opt for the tracking program for affordability.</p>
<p>But not all customers may be willing to join the program. It has been seen that many consumers do not prefer to join such programs. Some also practice bad driving habits like speeding or other dangerous stunts which may impact the insurance rates. There are also some apprehensions about the nature of data collected by the app and its usage by the company. But as the insurance industry is regulated it has not misused the user data under its control.</p>
