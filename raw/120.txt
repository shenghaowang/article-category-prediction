<p>King Entertainment's Candy Crush Saga app is aiming to fundÂ  $530 million for a $7.6 billion value on its Initial Public Offering submitted last month <em>The Telegraph</em> reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>"'Candy Crush' is in slight decline and I think that's what investors will focus on," Arvind Bhatia, an analyst at Sterne Agree and Leach told <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/-candy-crush-maker-king-prices-ipo-at-as-much-as-24-a-share.html" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg.</a>."They are trying to be cognizant of what happened to Zynga."</p>
<p>According to <em>The Telegraph,</em> plans to have shares from $21 and $24 each upon its arrival on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders Ventures and Apax are expected to market 6.7 million in shares.</p>
<p>"King simply must create multi-decade franchises around characters that last for generations - not for fortnights - before they can have a successful IPO at the valuation they want," Sam Hamadeh, founder of PrivCo, said in a statement prior to KING submitting necessary materials for the Initial Public Offering Feb. 18 Bloomberg reported.</p>
