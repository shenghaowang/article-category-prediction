<p>An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy, worth $201m.</p>
<p>The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100m policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.</p>
<p>“No one company can afford to take a $201m hit,” said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a “well-known billionaire”.</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen’s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said.</p>
<p>“It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.<div class="story-embed--ad">
