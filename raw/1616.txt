<p>"There is near unanimous agreement that our current housing finance system is not sustainable in the long-term, and reform is necessary to help strengthen and stabilize the economy," Johnson said.</p>
<p>The plan calls for the eventual elimination of the two federal mortgage purchasers, and preservation of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, initiatives designed to reduce the government's role in the mortgage market, the Washington newspaper the Hill reported Tuesday. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were put under government control during the 2008 economic crisis.</p>
<p>The proposed bill calls for transferring certain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac functions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Hill added.</p>
