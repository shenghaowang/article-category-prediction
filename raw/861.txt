<p>You may have read about it, you may have heard it on the news, or seen it on Facebook.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But believe me, nothing prepares you for Grandma cookies baked in "cannabutter," the pot smokers' smoking bus tour, the world of "vaping" (a soccer mom favourite, apparently) and the marijuana-infused chocolate dips, bath salts, sodas and, yes, sour patch gummy bears. All are part of Denver's ode to pot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Denver now has more marijuana stores than Starbucks coffee shops.</p>
<p>Watch Joyce Napier's documentary on Colorado's experiment with legalized marijuana tonight on <em>The National</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since New Year's Day, when marijuana was legalized in Colorado, this city has seemed to exist outside of America.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Colorado took the jump — the first of two states, Washington the other, to legalize recreational marijuana — the debate is now over.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's the new reality here: highly (pardon me) regulated, and surprisingly disciplined, and it seems to be working just fine, for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Colorado marijuana growers and sellers, who could only cater to medical marijuana users before Jan. 1, can now sell to anyone 21 years and over with a valid ID.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Residents can buy one ounce at a time, visitors are limited to a quarter ounce. All products are imprinted with bar codes, and are electronically traceable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don't try to smoke it in a public place, you'll get a fine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And no, you can't take it with you when you leave the state. All the marijuana has to be grown, sold and bought in Colorado.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The new law is manna for people like Toni Fox, owner of the 3D Cannabis Centre.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She made $1,000 a day in sales when she was catering to medical marijuana users. Now that she's gone recreational, she believes that by the fall, she'll be making $100,000 a day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new gold rush in Colorado is decidedly green.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That first day drew huge lineups, three hours long, at dispensaries — like the ones at Apple stores on the day a new iPhone comes out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>No one whined. Many of those waiting in line that freezing Colorado winter morning — a dry cold, as they say here — were going to buy legal pot for the first time in their lives. The excitement kept them warm</p>
<p></p>
<p>That same excitement, and the thrill of not having to hide your pot away, is attracting many Americans to Denver nowadays, a kind of spillover tourist boom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Matt Brown is the co-founder of My 4/20 Tours, "the first legal marijuana tourism company in North America." He has thousands on his waiting list, he says.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He gets clients like Mauricio and Kim, from El Paso, Tex. They came to Denver for a total marijuana weekend. Pot à gogo, without the guilt trip. They even get to attend a marijuana cooking class.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"It's like being in Amsterdam without having to take a plane," Mauricio says.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pot tourists can eat it, smoke it, drink it, chew it, bathe in it, inhale it from a battery-powered vaporizer, and even rub it in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They can visit grow-ops and dispensaries where jars of marijuana are neatly arranged by strains.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Denver, you can buy some "Juicy Fruit" and "Purple Kush" and "Gigabud" as well as all sorts of spreadables, chewables and edibles. That's where the money is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Smoking is out. Denver has a Clean Air Act that forbids smoking in public places, and that includes joints, of course. So eating marijuana-laced cookies, cakes and candies is the thing now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back at Love's Oven, for instance, one of many budding marijuana bakeries, business is up more than 1,000 per cent. Hope, the executive chef, can't bake them fast enough.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her best-seller? The ginger cookie that "will make you happy for a long time."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yesterday's pushers are today's marijuana entrepreneurs: promoters, sellers growers and bakers. You can find them sipping martinis on a Friday evening at the casually chic Space Gallery for a "Threesome with Mary Jane" soirée, at $120 a pop for food, open bar and a nearby limo bus to smoke your pot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's a new world. It is also a big social issue and so it has become a specialty beat for the Denver Post. The state's largest daily now has a website dedicated to marijuana, The Cannabist, with its own editor in chief and pot critics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Colorado experiment, as it's called, looks to be quite the success so far. The state might even make as much as $150 million this year in marijuana taxes (almost double previous estimates). Much of that money will be by law reinvested in schools and education.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's early days, of course, but there has been no reported increase in crime or traffic accidents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One imponderable, though: how to test for driving under the influence of marijuana?</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then there is the banking issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Banks are still nervous about accepting drug profits — it's still a crime federally here in the U.S. — although Washington has said it won't prosecute in states where pot is legal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many dispensaries store their money in safes. But one can bet that, as profits grow, banks will happily join the green rush.</p>
