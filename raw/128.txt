<p>Colorado raked in more than $2 million in tax revenue in the first month of recreational marijuana sales.</p>
<p>If sales keep the same pace, revenues will be less than the $70 million projected for the year, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25314108/colorado-saw-2-million-recreational-marijuana-taxes-january">the Denver Post reported. </a></p>
<p>According to the report, the state collected $1.4 million from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana and $416,690 from the state's standard 2.9 percent sales tax.</p>
<p>This means that cannabis shops sold more than $14 million in product during the month of January. Most of those sales came out of the city of Denver.</p>
<p>The first $40 million generated from excise taxes are earmarked for a state school construction fund. So far, $195,318 has gone into that fund,<a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-colorado-sales-taxes-20140310,0,2960725.story#axzz2vWLHy5mN"> the Los Angeles Times reported.</a></p>
<p>According to the Denver Post, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January. That number will continue to grow as a total of 167 stores were approved for marijuana sales by the end of February. </p>
<p>Legalized recreational sales in Washington State will launch in June.</p>
