<p>Bond management firm <span class="company"><a href="/Search/Link/Keyword/Pacific Investment Management Company LCC" rel="nofollow">Pacific Investment Management Company LCC</a></span> (PIMCO), headed by the legendary <span class="person"><a href="/Search/Link/Keyword/Bill Gross" rel="nofollow">Bill Gross</a></span>, has raised funds worth $5.5 billion to buy toxic assets from banks—the European ones in particular, which have a lot of bad debt to shed and add up to their buffer. PIMCO’s move gains significance in light of the general tendency among investors in the past few years to “reach for yield” in an environment of low interest rates.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is obviously to blame. Through its Permanent Open Market Operations (POMO) and Quantitative Easing (QE) programmes, it has manipulated both short- and long-term lending rates. With the American central bank taking over as a major lender in the credit market, fixed income investors have had to stretch beyond their usual comfort zone to invest in other credit securities in their search for higher returns.</p>
<p>The move towards long-term bonds, which usually yield relatively higher rates compared to securities with shorter maturity terms (given the longer dated risk), has been one such. Moving towards credit securities of relatively lower credit quality, like corporate, junk and emerging market bonds, has been another. The most adventurous among investors have ventured into structured products which come with greater risk given their relative complexity.<div class="mobile-ad"><script>if(isDeviceEnabled('small')) { var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('/3106570/LM_WAP_Story_Middle_Multisize', [[300, 250], [336, 280],'fluid'], 'div-gpt-ad-1521537447711-1').addService(googletag.pubads());  googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); }</script><div id="div-gpt-ad-1521537447711-1"><script>if(isDeviceEnabled('small')) { googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1521537447711-1'); }); }</script></div></div></p>
<p>To give an idea of investors’ current risk appetite, last December amidst fears of the taper, the credit spread on US corporate bonds narrowed to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Notably, even former Fed chairman <span class="person"><a href="/Search/Link/Keyword/Ben Bernanke" rel="nofollow">Ben Bernanke</a></span> recognized the risk of investors stretching for higher returns early last year, saying “portfolio managers dissatisfied with low returns may ‘reach for yield’ by taking on more credit risk, duration risk, or leverage.” But he went on to downplay the risk it poses to the financial system.</p>
<p>Today, given the pressures of inflation following years of money-printing, interest rates will have to rise at some point. The Fed’s decision to gradually ease QE (which is only one of the many tools the Fed has employed to control the credit market) could mark the beginning of a future of higher rates—or may be not if <span class="person"><a href="/Search/Link/Keyword/Janet Yellen" rel="nofollow">Janet Yellen</a></span> backtracks after wobbly economic data. But when rates eventually rise, with the Fed (in terms of ten- year equivalents) owning one-third of the US bond market, the unwinding of credit is likely to be painful. The bond bubble fuelled by the Fed will pop.</p>
<p>Higher rates, combined with inflation (that has remained dormant in the West, at least according to official figures), could mean very bad news for fixed income investors. The effect of higher rates on borrowers is another matter of crucial importance. Meanwhile, covenant-light loans (or cov-lites, characterized by loose lending standards) and municipal bonds are two things to watch out. Cov-lites formed over 40% of total loans issued in 2013, and investments in municipal bonds, despite their low quality, have started to pick up this year—in the hope of a federal bailout—after the Detroit crisis last year.<div class="mobile-ad"><script>if(isDeviceEnabled('small')) { var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineSlot('/3106570/LM_WAP_Story_Bottom1_Multisize', [[300, 250], [336, 280],'fluid'], 'div-gpt-ad-1521537447711-3').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); }</script><div id="div-gpt-ad-1521537447711-3"><script>if(isDeviceEnabled('small')) { googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1521537447711-3'); }); }</script></div></div></p>
<p>Also, it may be not just the developed markets that bear the pain. A recent International Monetary Fund paper estimated nearly half the existing (as of 2013) foreign investment in emerging markets debt to have been made in three years since 2010. Emerging market debt—despite all claims of being “priced in”—may not be insulated from the credit unwind in the West.</p>
<p>Investments that catch the imagination of investors in their search for yield are often those that run amok during times of “flight to safety”. Smart money should understand that timing the market during such a collapse is a loser’s game, but PIMCO at the moment seems to be prefixed on the fear of missing out on high yield.</p>
