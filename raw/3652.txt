<p data-page="1">Employers in the U.S. posted slightly more jobs in January despite harsh weather in many parts of the country, a positive sign for the labor market in coming months.</p>
<p>Job openings rose to nearly 4 million in January, a 1.5% increase from the month before, the Labor Department said Tuesday. That was just south of November's five-year high of 4.1 million.</p>
<p>Leisure and hospitality added 156,000 net openings in the first month of 2014. Construction opened up 32,000 extra slots, while education and health services added 65,000 openings.</p>

<p>The Tuesday report estimated that for every open job, there are about 2.6 unemployed U.S. workers. That's a big improvement from the 2009 peak of 6.7 jobless Americans per open position.</p>
<p>However, not all the news was rosy.</p>
<p>Hiring overall actually fell 0.9%, to 4.5 million, from the month prior. Although more companies are posting open positions, many are still taking their time and hiring carefully.</p>
