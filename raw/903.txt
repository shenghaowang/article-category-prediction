Pressprich &amp; Co. reports projects the firm will be “modestly Free Cash Flow <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/j-c-penney-company-inc-rock-bottom/">negative</a> in fiscal 2014 and 2015, but see upside potential in our earnings/cash flow model. Free Cash Flow is projected at ($57) million and ($124) million in FY14 and FY15, respectively.” Ruggiero also notes that these projections do not include asset sales.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Ruggiero also focuses on the possibility, or from his perspective, the likelihood, of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) undertaking debt refinancing within a year or so. “We continue to expect that JCP will have sufficient financial flexibility to refinance its 6.875% Senior Notes due 10/15/15. Further, we would not be surprised if the Company refinances its 7.65% Debentures due 8/15/16 at the same time as it takes out its 2015 maturity. We think that a first half 2015 refinancing is possible.”</p>
