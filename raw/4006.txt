<p></p>
<p>This time it's on Herbalife's business practices in China. </p>
<p>Pershing Square says they have done an investigation and that they have evidence that the company is operating in violation of Chinese law.</p>

<p>In late 2012, at a special Sohn Conference event, Ackman publicly declared that Pershing Square was shorting $1 billion worth of Herbalife stock. In a 342-slide presentation, Ackman laid out his thesis that the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals, particularly from the Hispanic population. </p>
<p>It's his belief that regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to investigate and shut the company down.  </p>
<p>Herbalife has denied Ackman's allegations. </p>
<p>What's more is a number of hedge fund managers, most notably Ackman's rival Carl Icahn, have snapped up significant long positions in the stock.  </p>
<p>He's continued to say that he will take this short "to the end of the earth." </p>
