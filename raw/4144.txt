<p>The Bon-Ton Stores on Tuesday reported a 17.6 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profits but a smaller net loss for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1.</p>
<p>The York-based chain also announced that Brendan L. Hoffman, president and chief executive officer, will step down when his employment agreement expires in February 2015.</p>
<p>Hoffman, who was hired from Lord &amp; Taylor in February 2012, said the decision was due to “strictly personal reasons.”</p>

<p>Though The Bon-Ton cut interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense, the quarter’s bottom line was hurt by bad weather that restricted sales.</p>
<p>For the year, the net loss was $3.6 million (19 cents a share), compared to a loss of $21.6 million ($1.16 a share) in fiscal 2012. Sales fell 5.1 percent to $2.77 billion.</p>
