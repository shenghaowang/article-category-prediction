<p>The Affordable Care Act enables primary health care, which in turn promotes education about healthy lifestyle choices. George F. Will’s March 13 op-ed column, “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-will-drop-in-childhood-obesity-may-be-due-to-better-choices/2014/03/12/305c6ba6-a946-11e3-b61e-8051b8b52d06_story.html" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Government health action that works</a>,” argued that healthy lifestyle choices and changes have more impact and are less risky than preventive medication. I’m not sure if he meant to advocate for a basic premise of Obamacare, but thanks!</p>
