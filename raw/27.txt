<p>Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which begs the question - how often do people tip their baristas?<br/></p>
<p>The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting next Wednesday.<br/></p>
<p>The rollout comes as the company's app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.</p>
<p>After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction.<br/></p>
<p>The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.</p>
