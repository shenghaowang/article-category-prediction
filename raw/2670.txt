<p>McDonald’s performance disappointed in February as the fast food giant weathered harsh competition and cold winter temperatures for lower-than-expected sales, particularly in the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. sales dropped a full 1.4 percent “amid challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather,” McDonald’s said in a statement Monday. The company’s sales were also down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions.</p>
<p>“We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter,” McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen  said</p>
<p>By contrast, European sales rose 0.6 percent in February thanks to strong performance in the United Kingdom and France, which made up for soft performance in Germany.</p>
<p>McDonald’s has seen two years of mediocre sales in the United States due to sluggish economic growth and increased competition.</p>
