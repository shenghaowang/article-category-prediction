More safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish technical posture are prompting buying interest in the yellow metal. April gold was last up $14.40 at $1,361.10 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $11.10 at $1,361.00. May Comex silver last traded up $0.205 at $21.02 an ounce.</p>
<p>The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week.

Concern about the health of the Chinese economy has weighed down the Asian and European stock markets this week.
