<p>Malaysia Airlines believes the co-pilot aboard the missing plane spoke the last words to ground controllers.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that initial investigations indicate that co-pilot is the one who calmly said, "All right, good night."</p>
<p>Officials previously have said that those words came at a point in the March 8 flight when one of the jetliner's data communications systems already had been switched off.</p>
<p>The timing of the last words has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance.</p>
