<p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang shared the story of an interesting encounter with a shop owner in Vietnam at a press conference following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.<br/><br/>Li says when he was in Hanoi during a tour to the ASEAN countries in 2013, he reached consensus with Vietnamese leaders on a variety of issues including maritime joint development. <br/><br/>He said he wanted to hear what the people there say about China and Vietnam working together, so he left his hotel and visited a small shop in the evening, where the female shop owner recognized him right away.<br/><br/>"She welcomes Chinese customers; certainly they would bring more business to her shop. I asked her about her opinion on relations between neighboring countries, and she wished for people to live in peace and friendship, which I think is also everyone's wish," Li said. <br/><br/>Li has stressed mutual respect for neighboring countries to work in harmony and pursue common interest.<br/><br/>The premier added that people need to work together to maximize mutual benefits and minimize conflict, which would benefit everybody. </p>
