<p id="U760149593413209">Colorado made about $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business.</p>
<p id="U7601495934132sXG">The tax total <span>reported by the state Revenue Department </span>indicates that $14.02 million worth of <span>recreational </span>pot was sold. The state collected about $2.01 million in taxes.</p>
<p>Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Sales in Washington state will begin in the coming months.</p>
<p>The pot taxes come from a 12.9 percent sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax. Voters approved the taxes last year. They said that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go toward school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.</p>

<p>The United Methodist Church announced on Monday that it is dropping its case against a New York clergyman accused of defying church policy by officiating at his son’s same-sex wedding.</p>
<p id="U7601495934132gRG">The church said a trial over the actions of the Rev. Thomas Ogletree, a former dean at Yale University’s divinity school, could cause “harmful polarization” during the ongoing debate about the church’s stance on same-sex unions.</p>
<p>The move came three months after a Pennsylvania pastor was defrocked after he was found guilty of officiating at his son’s same-sex wedding. Instead of facing trial, Ogletree will participate in conversations about the church’s policy on such unions.</p>
