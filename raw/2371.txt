<p>Beijing - China's industrial output rose 8.6 percent in January and February year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Thursday, the worst result in nearly five years.</p>
<p>The figure, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, was the lowest since 7.3 percent was recorded in April 2009, according to previous NBS data.</p>
<p>Retail sales, a key indicator of consumer spending in the world's second-largest economy, gaining 11.8 percent in the two months from the year before, the NBS said on its website.</p>
<p>That figure was also the lowest for several years.</p>
<p>Fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 17.9 percent during the first two months of 2014, the NBS added.</p>
<p>The body released statistics covering a two month period due to China's Lunar New year holiday week, which fell in both months.</p>
<p>The figures come as China's leadership says it wants to transform the growth model away from an over-reliance on often wasteful investment, and instead make private demand the driver for the country's future development.</p>
<p>China announced earlier this month that is targeting economic growth of about 7.5 percent in 2014, the same as last year.</p>
<p>The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.7 percent in 2013, unchanged from the year before, which was the worst result since 1999. - Sapa-AFP</p>
