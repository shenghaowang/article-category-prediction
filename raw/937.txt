	US stocks opened slightly lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&amp;P 500, following unexpectedly weak data from China that tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.

	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 44.89 points, or 0.27%, at 16,407.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was down 3.14 points, or 0.17%, at 1,874.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 5.25 points, or 0.12%, at 4,330.97.
