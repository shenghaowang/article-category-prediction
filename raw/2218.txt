<p>More Americans relied on public transit (bus and rail) in 2013 than in any year since 1956, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) said Monday, March 10, 2014.</p>
<p>APTA said overall transit ridership rose 1.1% during 2013, with almost 10.7 billion trips taken on public transport, recovering from somewhat depressed levels attributed to the Great Recession.</p>
<p>“People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said <a href="http://www.apta.com/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">APTA</a> President and CEO Michael Melaniphy. “This is a long-term trend. This isn’t just a blip.”</p>
<p>Among other large systems, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) light rail transit ridership rose 6% from 2012 levels, in part due to LACMTA’s expanding LRT reach. Including bus transport, LACMTA ridership rose 1.9% over 2012 levels.</p>
<p>New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority ridership on regional rail, subway, and bus lines rose 3.6% in 2013, according to APTA figures and MTA officials.</p>
