<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Alibaba's eye-popping IPO plans in the U.S. just sent ripples from Hong Kong to New York to Sunnyvale, Calif.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text"><b>MORE: </b><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/money/markets/2014/03/16/gains-ipos-market/6427433/" title="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/16/gains-ipos-market/6427433/"> Eye-popping gains by IPOs are back</a></p>
<p class="p-text">The decision by the Chinese e-commerce leviathan -- whose online properties handle more goods than eBay and Amazon.com combined -- to hold its long-awaited public offering in the USA is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company's preferred venue.</p>
<p class="p-text">But it is a boon to two of Alibaba's largest shareholders: Yahoo, which owns 24%, and Japan's Softbank, which controls 37%.</p>
<p class="p-text">Alibaba's success has essentially propped up the Silicon Valley Internet giant's shares hugely, even as its core business has languished. Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimated in a recent research note that Alibaba alone is worth $21 of Yahoo's stock price, which closed at $37.60 on Friday.</p>

<p class="p-text">Alibaba Group doesn't report its finances. But Yahoo, which initially invested in it in 2005, said Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ending in September rose 51% from a year earlier to $1.8 billion.</p>
<p class="p-text">(That's down from 61% growth over a year earlier in the previous quarter and 71% in the first quarter of 2013.)</p>
<p class="p-text">While the Hong Kong market mourns its lost golden goose, U.S. investors have billions of dollar signs dancing in their heads and calculators.</p>
<p class="p-text p-text-last" id="article-body-p-last">Alibaba, which controls about 80% of China's e-commerce, is sure to add sizzle to the New York financial scene: Its public offering could be one of the biggest ever in the U.S. Some estimates peg its valuation at $130 billion.</p>
