<p><strong>Amazon.com</strong> <span class="ticker" data-id="202816">(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/amazon/amzn">NASDAQ:AMZN</a>)</span> can't say it surprised its customers with an increase for its Amazon Prime loyalty membership plan. The leading online retailer is pushing its annual membership <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/13/amazon-is-primed.aspx">up by $20 to $99 a year</a>, but it had suggested in its most recent quarterly earnings call that the price could have gone even higher.</p>
<p>It would have been better if Amazon had timed this uptick to coincide with the addition of new features. At least then, customers would have associated the increase with enhanced benefits. Still, this is the first increase to Amazon Prime since its inception nine years ago. Can customers really complain about a 25% uptick after nine years, compared with what inflation has done to their cable bills, transportation costs, or even movie outings?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/14/why-im-dropping-amazon-prime.aspx">Some folks</a> will throw in the towel, of course. If Amazon's premium shopping platform had total pricing elasticity, it would have raised its prices years ago. However, Amazon clearly believes it can push through this rate increase, which will kick in later this month for new members and for when existing members hit their anniversary renewals. It will also be interesting to see whether those who stick around will find themselves spending even more to justify the steeper cover charge.  </p>

<p><strong>Learning from the past helps you spot hot trends in the future</strong><br/>Every investor wants to get in on revolutionary ideas before they hit it big -- like buying PC maker Dell in the late 1980s, before the consumer computing boom, or purchasing stock in e-commerce pioneer Amazon.com in the late 1990s, when it was nothing more than an upstart online bookstore. The problem is, most investors don't understand <a href="https://www.fool.com/ecap/stock-advisor/sa-web-goes-dark/?aid=6972&amp;source=isaeditxt0000098">the key to investing in hypergrowth markets</a>.
