<p>The Karkhadi plant makes both drug ingredients and formulations, according to Sun's 2013 annual report.</p>
<p>An "import alert" results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices, <a href="http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/uniform-standards-being-imposed-on-all-countries-us-fda-commissioner-to-indian-firms/1/203241.html" mce_href="http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/uniform-standards-being-imposed-on-all-countries-us-fda-commissioner-to-indian-firms/1/203241.html" target="_blank" title="Uniform standards being imposed on all countries: US FDA Commissioner ">according to the FDA website.</a></p>

<p>The FDA action against Sun Pharma comes amid a rash of regulatory sanctions against Indian generic makers in the last year, triggering concerns about the quality of the medicines supplied by India's $14 billion drug industry to countries including the United States, the biggest market.</p>
<p>USFDA has banned all the <a href="http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/ranbaxy-suspends-drug-ingredient-shipments-from-two-plants/1/203706.html" mce_href="http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/ranbaxy-suspends-drug-ingredient-shipments-from-two-plants/1/203706.html" target="_blank">India plants of Ranbaxy Laboratories,</a> India's No.1 drugmaker by sales, due to lapses in production quality.
