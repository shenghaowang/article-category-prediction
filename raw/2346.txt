<p>March 31 looms ever closer.</p>
<p>That's the deadline for you to get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. After then, you'll only be able to get insurance on the health care exchange when there's a big change in your life: a birth, divorce, death, losing your employer-sponsored insurance, or moving to another state.</p>
<p>The latest numbers show 144,586 people in Michigan have gotten health insurance under Obamacare.</p>
<p>And, with more people covered, doctors and hospitals are expecting an uptick in treating one of our state's biggest health challenges: obesity. </p>
<p>We're joined by Heather Howard, program director of the State Health Reform Assistance Network. </p>
