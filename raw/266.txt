<p>Noting at an industry conference Monday that Comcast has tackled big integrations before, Comcast Cable president and CEO Neil Smit said the cable giant has already assembled a small integration team for its pending merger with Time Warner Cable, adding that the initial focus will likely be on upgrading TWC plants to all-digital.</p>
<p>Smit, speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet &amp; Telecom conference in Palm Beach, Fla., said the primary focus will be to keep both businesses running well.</p>
<p>Comcast agreed on Feb. 13 to acquire Time Warner Cable in an all-stock deal valued at about $69 billion, including assumed debt. The merger, which will create a 30-million subscriber cable powerhouse with a near national reach, is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
