<p data-page="1">U.S. investigators are convinced "manual intervention" is to blame for the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, ABC News reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The shutdown of two communication systems happened separately on the Beijing-bound flight, indicating the flight — missing since Saturday — may have been sabotaged, a U.S. official said in the report.</p>
<p>At 1:07 a.m., the plane's data reporting system was shut down, two U.S. officials said. Then at 1:21 a.m., the transponder — which transmits location and altitude — stopped working.</p>
<p>The revelation that catastrophic failure may not be to blame for the plane's disappearance came as the search area extended to the Indian Ocean on Thursday.</p>
<p>Satellites picked up weak electronic pulses from the doomed aircraft carrying 239 people for four hours after it dropped off radar screens early Saturday, an indication it was still flying for hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>The Pentagon sent the Kidd, a U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, to the Indian Ocean following a lead that the airliner may have crashed there.</p>
<p>"We have an indication the plane went down in the Indian Ocean," an unnamed Pentagon official said, according to ABC News.</p>
<p>While the pulses sent from the plane to a satellite indicate the aircraft was in the air longer than previously believed, they give no indication as to where the plane was and which direction it was heading, officials said.</p>
<p>Investigators have doubled the search area to 35,000 square miles, spreading west from the waters around the Malaysian peninsula and the South China Sea toward the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>"It's my understanding that based on some new information that's not necessarily conclusive — but new information — an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington.</p>
<p>The hunt for the missing plane has been littered with false leads since it disappeared about an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday.</p>
<p>Hopes raised Wednesday by reports that a Chinese satellite had spotted possible large pieces of wreckage from the flight floating in the South China Sea were dashed Thursday as Malaysian officials said the satellite images are not pieces of the Boeing 777.</p>
<p>"There is nothing," said Malaysia's civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. "We went there; there is nothing."</p>
<p>Malaysian officials also denied reports that cited U.S. officials as saying the plane stayed aloft for as many as four hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>More than 80 planes and ships from a dozen countries have been involved in the search for the missing aircraft.</p>
<p>The Kidd and another US Navy destroyer, the Pinckney, had been searching areas south of the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
<p>A U.S. Navy P-3 Onion aircraft has searched the Strait of Malacca, an area between the Malaysian peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.</p>
