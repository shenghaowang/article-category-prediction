<p>A federal prosecutor has kicked off a criminal  investigation into <a href="/topics/general-motors/">General Motors</a> over the company’s seeming  foot-dragging on a recall of vehicles with faults that led to the death  of at least 13.</p>
<p>The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, <a href="/topics/cnn/">CNN</a>  Money reported, citing similar stories in Bloomberg, Reuters and The  New York Times.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny the  investigation, <a href="/topics/cnn/">CNN</a> Money reported. A spokesman for the office said the  official normally declined to speak publicly about any investigation  that was in the early stages.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/general-motors/">GM</a> spokesman Alan Adler said the comment would not comment.</p>
<p>The company faces fire for its slow recall of several models — from  the Chevrolet Cobalt to the Saturn Ion — that had ignition switch  issues. <a href="/topics/general-motors/">GM</a> knew of the problems a decade ago, but only issued the  recall, which involved ultimately 1.4 million vehicles, in February.  Federal law mandates that companies must notify customers of failures  and recall alerts within five days of finding the mechanical failure.</p>
<p>At least 13 people reportedly died in traffic mishaps related to the ignition with issue, <a href="/topics/cnn/">CNN</a> Money reported.</p>
