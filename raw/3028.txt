<p class="headline">Mt Gox collapse  shatters Bitcoin myth of virtual money</p>
<p>By Peter  Morici<br/>
<span class="date">web posted March 10, 2014</span></p>
<p>Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when  Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed.</p>
<p>The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more  private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking  the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your  wealthâyou can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed  bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barterâa necessity for even the  most rudimentary market economy. </p>
<p>Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker  who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government  declares those to be “legal tender for all debts public and private.”</p>
<p>You can do business through barter or some alternative  currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars,  and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter.</p>
<p>What gives money its value are the goods and services that  may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the  issuing government.</p>
<p>The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of  the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments  minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more  than two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual  currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and  destroy its value through inflation.  However, inflation is hardly a  problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries  hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly  difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency’s creator, and  like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on  private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much  like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal  Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world. </p>
<p>There is no “Bitland” where a government has declared it  legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes.  Lacking such a  tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day,  never mind next year. </p>
<p>Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands  only about half that amount. </p>
<p>It is no place for your children’s college fund or  retirement savings. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your  digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole  bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not  stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to  thieves. </p>
<p>A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin  exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike  commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its  private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard. </p>
<p>However, personal and business transactions can be spied  by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments  system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your  exchange when it needs. </p>
<p>Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin  is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised.</p>
<p>Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the  absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a  currency accepted and secureâthe government guarantee and the good sense of the  sovereign not to abuse its franchise.  </p>
<p>It’s not the gold but the face of Caesarâthe promise his  image carriesâthat makes a coin money. <img alt="ESR" height="13" src="../../images/esr.jpg" width="24"/></p>
