<p>Investing.com - The pound fell to two-week lows against the
dollar on Tuesday after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney
indicated that there is leeway for the bank to leave rates on hold
for longer.</p>
<p>GBP/USD hit 1.6597, the lowest since February 24 and was last
down 0.20% to 1.6610.</p>
<p>Cable was likely to find support at 1.6550 and resistance at
1.6685.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>During testimony to parliament's Treasury Select Committee on
Tuesday, Carney said the amount of spare capacity in the economy
was probably slightly higher than 1.5% of gross domestic product,
indicating that the economic recovery can continue without pushing
up inflation.</p>
<p>He added that there was a range of views among the bank's
monetary policy committee members on the amount of spare capacity
in the economy.</p>
<p>Carney also reiterated that when rate increases do come they
will be gradual.</p>
<p>Sterling has strengthened against many of the other main
currencies in recent months, amid expectations the BoE could raise
rates ahead of other central banks.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, data showed that U.K. manufacturing output rose
more than expected in January, but bad weather hampered the broader
measure of industrial output.</p>
<p>Manufacturing production rose 0.4% in January, the Office for
National Statistics reported, above expectations for a 0.3% gain,
while December's figure was revised up to a 0.4% increase from a
previously reported gain of 0.3%.</p>
<p>On a year-over-year basis, manufacturing production rose 3.3%,
up from 1.4% in December.</p>
<p>Industrial output rose 0.1% in January, slowing sharply after a
0.5% increase in December and was up 2.9% from a year earlier.
Analysts had expected industrial output to rise 0.2% in
January.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, sterling was little changed against the euro, with
EUR/GBP inching up 0.01% to 0.8340.</p>
<p>The pair briefly dipped to session lows earlier after European
Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said the bank made its
forward guidance on the existence of slack in the euro zone economy
more precise at last week's meeting, but this was not picked up by
markets.</p>
<p>He also said the central bank still had policy options
available, including lower interest rates or quantitative easing,
if necessary.</p>
