<p>Next week when <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2014/03/12/want-to-tip-your-starbucks-barista-now-theres-an-app-for-that/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Starbucks</strong> updates its official app</a> users will not only be able to order their favorite lattes, coffees and frappuccino’s, but will also be able to tip their baristas for making it. Mar. 19, Starbucks will update its app to make it easier to navigate and also add digital tipping for the first time. Other features include “Shake to Pay” which instantly loads your Starbucks card up from anywhere within the app.</p>
<p>After paying, users will get a notification encouraging them to also pay between $.50 to $2 in the store’s virtual tip jar. Even more interesting is users can adjust the tip for up to two hours after your purchase. So in case your drink is absolutely terrible or amazing you’ll be able to either bump up your tip or lower it and every purchase is saved as a digital receipt you can access later on. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/12/5499640/starbucks-iphone-tipping-baristas-digitally" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to The Verge</a> tipping option will roll out next week, it won’t be available on every corner. While there’s around 11,000 Starbucks stores in the US, the company says tipping will only be available at 7,000 of the company-operated locations.</p>
