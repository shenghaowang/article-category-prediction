<p>“Markets are confused right now, after getting conflicting set of data. On the one hand, job openings indicated demand for workers and improvement in labor markets, on the other, wholesale inventories rose, as businesses overshot and could not sell goods sooner,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, portfolio manager and senior equity analyst at  Fort Pitt Capital.</p>
