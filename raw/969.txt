<p class="imageCaption">Under pressure: Mark Carney is to answer questions by MPs over the Bank's closeness to foreign exchange dealers</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be drawn into the growing scandal over currency manipulation on Tuesday when MPs allege the Bank’s governance has been inadequate. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Carney will answer questions from the Treasury Select Committee, alongside executive director of markets Paul Fisher. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The Bank is facing questions over its closeness to foreign exchange dealers and whether it tacitly condoned manipulation of the market, amid a widening regulatory probe of currency trading. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">A staff member at the Bank was suspended last week over the affair. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The Bank said that an extensive review of documents, emails and other records has to date found no evidence that staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"> 
It added: ‘However, the Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes.’ </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">MPs are concerned that the review may not  have been sufficiently independent, and that the Bank’s non-executives should have been in charge of any investigation. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The committee’s chairman Andrew Tyrie said: ‘There is a strong case that the non executives in the Bank should have taken the initiative on this from the moment the need for external assistance was considered. 
‘That was last October, possibly earlier.’</font></p>
