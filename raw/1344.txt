<p data-page="1">The Federal Trade Commission has launched a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the Los Angeles-based nutritional-products maker said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Herbalife did not disclose any details of the probe, but it has been waging an ongoing battle against a hedge fund manager's allegations that it is running a thinly disguised pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>The company reiterated its long-stated position that its business model is sound and said it would cooperate with the inquiry.</p>
<p>"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC," the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."</p>
<p>Herbalife's shares sank after the company disclosed that the federal agency had sent it a civil investigative demand. The stock fell $6.89, or 10.5%, to $58.50 immediately after the news.</p>
<p>The company sells nutrition and health products through independent salespeople in more than 80 countries. Its products are not available in stores.</p>
<p>In December 2012, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman accused Herbalife of operating a pyramid scheme and announced that he had bet more than $1 billion on Wall Street that the value of the company's stock would fall. Thus far, Ackman has suffered a paper loss of about $500 million.</p>
<p>The company's stock fell sharply at the time but recovered last year, gaining more than 100% when regulators appeared not to react to the allegations. Ackman trimmed his short position, a Wall Street play that pays when a stock's price falls.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ackman has kept up a relentless battle against Herbalife, releasing a steady stream of reports that purport to show Herbalife abuses.</p>
