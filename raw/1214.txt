<p> <strong>JC Penney</strong> (<a class="icon none" href="http://quotes.barrons.com/JCP?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">JCP</a>) has been down so long it's finally looking up, especially after a <strong>Citigroup </strong>upgrade today.</p>
<p>Citigroup's <strong>Oliver Chen</strong> and team explain why they raised their rating on JC Penney's shares:</p>
<p>JC Penney wasn't the only retailer getting some love today: <strong>Macy's </strong>(<a class="icon none" href="http://quotes.barrons.com/M?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">M</a>), was raised to Outperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo, while <strong>Aeropostale</strong> (<a class="icon none" href="http://quotes.barrons.com/ARO?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">ARO</a>) was started as a Buy at Buckingham Research. <strong>Urban Outfitters</strong> (<a class="icon none" href="http://quotes.barrons.com/URBN?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">URBN</a>), however, has dropped after making downbeat comments about the first quarter, while <strong>American Eagle Outfitters </strong>(<a class="icon none" href="http://quotes.barrons.com/AEO?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">AEO</a>) has fallen after it offered disappointing guidance.</p>
<p>Shares of JC Penney have gained 8.5% to $9.13 at 10:22 a.m. today, while Macy's has risen 2.3% to $59.46 and Aeropostale is up 2.3% at $7.16. Urban Outfitters has fallen 4.3% to $35.88 and American Eagle Outfitters has dropped 6.5% to $13.27.</p>
