<p>Another Bank of England policymaker has raised concern about how a strengthening sterling could derail efforts to lift exports and rebalance the UK's recovering economy.</p>
<p>Charlie Bean, a deputy governor at the BoE who sits on the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), noted that sterling had fallen in value by more than 25% during the financial crisis which should have driven up demand for British exports.</p>
<p>"Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports," Bean said in a Darlington speech.</p>
<p>"The performance of exports – particularly exports of services – has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing.</p>
<p>"It may be that this is just a matter of time – for instance, we are starting to hear stories of businesses bringing back activities that they had previously off-shored to emerging economies.</p>
<p>"But any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports."</p>
<p>Sterling has been hitting new highs against the US dollar and euro, currencies of two of the UK's key trading partners.</p>
<p>Bean's comments follow those of fellow MPC member Ian McCafferty who said a stronger sterling would be a good reason to delay hiking interest rates.</p>
<p>"I don't think to my mind at present [sterling is] a major problem for British exporters," said McCafferty.</p>
<p>"But were it to rise further ... then I think it is something we would need to study quite closely."</p>
<p>Chancellor George Osborne has targeted a £1tn value for UK exports by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>This is under his drive to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and away from its reliance on services, which account for three quarters of GDP.</p>
<p>But he has admitted that the recovery, which saw the economy grow by 1.8% in 2013, is not yet balanced or sustainable as global demand for UK exports remains subdued.</p>
<p>The BoE's base rate is at a record-low of 0.5%. Policymakers said they would not raise interest rates until productivity picks up, incomes are no long in real terms decline, and the recovery looked to be secured.</p>
<p>A stronger sterling could delay any rise in interest rates.</p>
