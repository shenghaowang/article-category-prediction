<p>PEKIN, In. (WDRB) --Hanging and laughing with friends, and signing those Luke Bryan songs everyone at school likes, it&amp;aposs what young girls do when they&amp;aposre healthy.</p>
<p>Those are the moments, now few and far between, that Trinity Goodson cherishes. </p>
<p>"It started June 21st of 2012. It&amp;aposs been going on for about 19 months," she explained.</p>
<p>Trinity was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin&amp;aposs Lymphoma.</p>
<p>"It felt like a nuclear bomb had been dropped on my family," her mom, Laura said.</p>
<p>Trinity rapidly began to lose her hair, and was forced to call Kosair Children&amp;aposs Hospital home. Her family feared the worst.</p>
<p>"That I was going to bury my 10-year-old child," said Trinity&amp;aposs mom.</p>
<p>The prognosis teeter-tottered. Then, a bright spot..</p>
<p>"They declared Trinity in remission in October," Laura Goodson said.</p>
<p>"I relapsed in November, and now I&amp;aposm facing a bone marrow transplant," Trinity explained. </p>
<p>It&amp;aposs easy for anyone in that spot to feel beat up, and less than positive, but that&amp;aposs what friends and family are for.</p>
<p>"I think the biggest thing that we wanted was for Trinity to feel uplifted and connected to us," Trinity&amp;aposs aunt, Lori Farris said.</p>
<p>So she and her daughter, Morgan, created a Facebook page called "Hearts for Trinity." The idea was to have people from wherever learn about Trinity&amp;aposs story and send hearts of all kinds showing their love and support.</p>
<p>"Not only her family, but other people were rooting for her and were behind her," Farris said.</p>
<p>"Likes" on the page started to sky rocket. </p>
<p>"It makes me really happy, and it makes me feel good because I know I&amp;aposm not alone in my fight," Trinity said.</p>
<p>It isn&amp;apost a cure, but hopefully the messages can tide a tough little girl and her family over, until she can get back to the life she loves and deserves.</p>
