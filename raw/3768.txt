<p>Chrysler is recalling 2012-'13 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs in order to fix a concern with the antilock brakes.</p>
<p>Approximately 25,250 vehicles are affected by the recall.</p>
<p>The recall will help improve pedal feel during "certain aggressive braking maneuvers," Chrysler said in a statement on its website.</p>
<p>"A supplier raised with the company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop," Chrysler said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it does not know of any related injuries or accidents.</p>
<p>Of the affected vehicles, approximately 18,700 are in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico and 5,200 outside the NAFTA region, according to the automaker.</p>
<p>A specific recall date has not been announced yet.         </p>
<p>"Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations," said Chrysler. "An investigation discovered brake-fluid flow was being restricted too much. A software update optimizes flow and restores appropriate pedal feel."</p>
<p>Chrysler dealers are being instructed to update the software in the affected vehicles, free of charge.</p>
<p>Owners with more questions can contact Chrysler at 1-800-853-1403.</p>
