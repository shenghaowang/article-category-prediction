<p>McDonald's (<a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="/companies/overview/1618/mcdonalds-1618.html" rel="1618">NYSE:MCD</a>) shares fell on Monday after reporting disappointing same store sales results for February as U.S. comparable sales declined 1.4% --- the fourth straight month of declines despite aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games. </p>
<p>The world's largest fast food chain said global comparable sales decreased by 0.3% last month, as Europe same store sales increased 0.6% while the metric in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region fell 2.6%. </p>
<p>International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan, as well as by a stronger dollar, which makes its food more expensive overseas. </p>
<p>"We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," said McDonald's CFO Pete Bensen in a statement announcing the sales figures this morning.  </p>
<p>"Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth."</p>
<p>The company said that systemwide sales globally, which includes sales at all restaurants whether operated by McDonald's or its franchisees, would have increased 2.2% if not for the weight of the stronger dollar instead of a 0.6% decline in February.</p>
<p>The burger chain blamed weakness in the U.S. last month, on top of a same store sales drop of 3.3% in January, on "challenging industry dynamics" and the harsh winter weather, while European sales were bolstered by the U.K. and France, mostly offsetting poor performance in Germany. </p>
<p>Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald’s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.</p>
<p>Shares of McDonald's were down 0.3% on Monday morning, at US$95.24, stretching year-to-date losses to almost 2%. </p>
