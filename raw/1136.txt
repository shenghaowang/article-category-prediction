<p>While we didn't report on the story ourselves, Amazon's decision to raise the price of its Prime membership service by $20 (to $100 a year) has hard corners of the internet up in arms, albeit over something no one really <em>needs</em> in the first place.</p>
<p>If you're not in one of the countries where Prime is available (I was surprised to learn that it is, in fact, available outside the US), you may not be familiar with the service. The gist is free 2-day shipping on a huge number of items (<a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bobkona-Michelson-3-Piece-Reversible-Sectional/dp/B005DC58QQ/ref=sr_1_8?tag=androidpolice-20&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394838132&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=sectional" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">even a $1000+ 3-piece sectional sofa</a>) available on Amazon, reduced pricing on overnight or weekend shipping, Kindle Lending Library access, and Amazon Prime's Instant Video service, which has thousands of free TV episodes and movies. For less than $10 a month, it's still a pretty remarkable deal.</p>

<p>And yet, there is decided angst being expressed about the change on various social networks, and the tech media is eating it up. So, we're curious - is the price hike going to cause you to say goodbye to Prime? Have you even said hello? I know I'll be keeping my subscription (which is still student for another year, though I'd happily pay $100 for the 'Prime Privilege'), as I know I get way more than my money's worth from the service between TV / movies and free shipping without having to spend $35 per order. Hell, I order my toothpaste from Amazon - I'd probably pay $150 a year for it without so much as flinching.</p>
<p>But $20 more a year has apparently caused some people to already pull the plug on their subscriptions. What say you?</p>
