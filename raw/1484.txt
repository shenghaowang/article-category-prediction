<p>With the deadline fast approaching for people without health insurance, Hattiesburg residents received some assistance today.</p>
<p>Pinebelt residents got a chance to participate in the Health Insurance Marketplace Enrollment Fair. Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree partnered with Health Help Mississippi and other organizations to help encourage citizens to enroll in a health care program. People who buy coverage on their own now have the option to purchase coverage through the Mississippi health insurance marketplace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"These health plans do cover the ten essential .health benefits, which include things like maternity services, hospital stays, ER visits, so at this point in time it's just important for everybody in Mississippi to have health coverage and  we at Health Help are trying to assist with that,"  said Health Help Regional Program Manager Kristina Cole</span></p>
<p>If people's income is below 400 percent of the federal poverty line (about $46,00/year for an individual), they could qualify for financial assistance to help pay for insurance.</p>
<p>Open enrollment will end March 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
