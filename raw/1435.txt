<p>With both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 Index hovering just below major trend line resistance levels, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) continues to push to new highs and well above former “channel top” resistance.</p>
<p>Importantly, this upward movement in transportation stocks is very positive for equity prices in general since a key element of Dow Theory suggests that transportation stocks usually lead the industrials to higher levels as economic activity improves.</p>
<p>Although overbought conditions are clearly present on all three indices at the moment, near-term corrections are always possible on each. Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.</p>
<p>That represents a potential 24% advance above current levels. It does not mean, however, that a move up to the 9,500 area is likely to emerge anytime soon, but it does represent an underlying optimism in equities that persists.</p>
<p>At this point in time, geopolitical and weather related issues continue to cloud future expectations for growth. That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.</p>
<p>Still, another facet of Dow Theory suggests that rising equity prices are usually accompanied by rising trading volumes which act as a confirmation to the prevailing bullish trend.</p>
<p>As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.</p>
