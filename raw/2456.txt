<strong>Bloomberg</strong> is citing analysts at the White House who report that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will stay profitable while under conservatorship for the next ten years.</p>
<p>
	In fact, citing annual analysis prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, there is a predicted $179 billion profit expected from the government-sponsored enterprises.</p>
<p>
	If so, that is a significant shrinkage in market share. Consider that since 2008, Fannie and Freddie returned $202 billion "to taxpayers."</p>
<p>
	But only recently were those profits realized, with loses and draws during the first few years.</p>
<p>
	$179 billion in profits from the next ten years predicts a huge mortgage slowdown for the GSEs.</p>
