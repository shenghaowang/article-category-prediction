<p>Confusion continues to surround the fate of an oil tanker that loaded a cargo of crude from the Libyan port of Es Sider, with the latest reports indicating the vessel had managed to escape the navy convoy that was accompanying it to a government-held port in western Libya.</p>

<p>The Libyan government said late Monday the Morning Glory, which is carrying a cargo of Es Sider crude loaded by rebels who are in control of the port in eastern Libya, had come under the navy's control.</p>
<p>At a late press conference in Tripoli, Libya's culture minister Amin al-Habib said the vessel was being escorted to a western port and was set to arrive "within hours."</p>
<p>However, early Tuesday, French news agency AFP quoted a member of the General National Congress, the country's highest political authority, as saying the vessel had slipped its escort.</p>
<p>
<br/>"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it," the lawmaker said, according to AFP.</p>
<p>Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.</p>
<p>"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.</p>
<p>A second GNC member confirmed the vessel's escape, and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.</p>
<p>Platts was unable to confirm the status of the Morning Glory early Tuesday.</p>
<p>The North Korea-flagged vessel on Monday completed loading a cargo of up to 350,000 barrels of Es Sider crude, but the Libyan navy surrounded the tanker before bringing it under its control.</p>
<p>Tripoli had also threatened to bomb the tanker if it set sail.</p>
<p>The government and state-owned oil company NOC have stressed that rebels in eastern Libya have no legal right to sell oil.</p>
<p>Tripoli has also formed a new armed force that will be charged with liberating three eastern Libyan ports -- Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Marsa al-Hariga -- that have been occupied by rebels since July last year.</p>
