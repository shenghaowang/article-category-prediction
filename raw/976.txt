<p>PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - Numericable Chief Executive Eric Denoyer said there was no need to sell assets in order to address competition issues as part of its bid to buy Vivendi’s SFR and criticised a rival offer from Bouygues Telecom as not credible. </p>
<p>“Our strategy is to build the best network and use it to grow - not on marrying two operators in decline just to wring out cost savings,” Denoyer said. “There is no need for asset sale or concessions or anything.” </p>
<p>He added: “Our synergies can be put in place very quickly because they are network based. The synergies can come through as early as this year.” </p>
<p>Bouygues Telecom said on the weekend it had agreed to sell its mobile network and much of its spectrum to smaller rival Iliad as a way to head off competition regulators’ concerns about its pending bid for SFR. </p>
<p>“I don’t even need to explain my plan B because I don’t think the other project is credible,” Denoyer added, referring to the rival offer.   (Reporting by Leila Abboud; Editing by Andrew Callus)</p>
