<p>LONDON (MarketWatch) -- The Bank of England on Tuesday appointed three new senior officials to join the central bank, including the high-profile role of Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy. Ben Broadbent will take over as a deputy governor on July 1, 2014 and be responsible for the BOE's research and analysis of the U.K. economy to support decisions at the Monetary Policy Committee. He will also chair the MPC in absence of Governor Mark Carney. In other appointments, Anthony Habgood will become the new Chairman of Court as well as chair of the Oversight Committee of Court, which reviews the BOE's processes and conduct. Nemat Shafik was appointed Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. The appointments come as the BOE has become entangled in a sprawling foreign-exchange probe, with Carney saying last week the bank will appoint a new senior official to tighten internal oversight.</p>
