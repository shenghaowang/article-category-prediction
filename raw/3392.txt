<p>Senator Bob Corker, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, issued the following statement on Tuesday, regarding Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo’s (R-Idaho) announcement on an agreement to reform the housing finance system.</p>
<p>“I have been working with Senator Warner and a bipartisan group of senators for months to advance legislation that ends the failed model of private gains and public losses in our housing finance system and moves our country to a modernized structure that protects the American taxpayer,” said Senator Corker. “I am pleased the Banking Committee is demonstrating their commitment to this effort by putting pen-to-paper and releasing a set of principles based on the bill we introduced, and I look forward to working closely with them in the coming months.”<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>Chairman Johnson and Senator Crapo announced that the Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act (S. 1217), introduced by Senators Corker and Mark Warner (D-Va.) and cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 10 senators, will serve as the base text for the committee’s housing finance reform bill.</p>
<p>In June 2013, Senator Corker and Warner introduced S.1217 to strengthen America’s housing finance system by replacing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a privately capitalized system that preserves market liquidity and protects taxpayers from future economic downturns. </p>
<p>In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into government conservatorship and given a $188 billion capital injection from taxpayers to stay afloat. As a result of this bailout, the private market has almost completely disappeared, and so nearly every loan made in America today comes with a full government guarantee. Despite this unsustainable situation, there has still been no real reform to our housing finance system since the financial crisis.</p>
<p>In addition to Corker and Warner, S. 1217 is currently cosponsored by Senators Mike Johanns (R-Ne.), Jon Tester (D-Mt.), Dean Heller (R-Ne.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Ks.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Mark Kirk (R-Il.), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), and Mark Begich (D-Ak.), which includes five Republicans and five Democrats from the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
