<p class="story-body__introduction">New Zealand's Fonterra has admitted four food-safety violations following a botulism scare last year that led to recalls of milk products in China.</p>
<p>Government officials had filed charges against the dairy company, accusing it of processing and exporting dairy products which did not meet standards.</p>
<p>Fonterra is also accused of failing to issue notification about its products not being fit for consumption. </p>
<p>The charges come as Fonterra faces civil court action from Danone.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the French company said it was suing Fonterra over recalls which Danone alleged led to the company losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. </p>
<p>Danone uses Fonterra ingredients in its infant milk formula. </p>
<p>Maury Leyland, a <a class="story-body__link-external" href="http://www.fonterra.com/cn/en/hub+sites/news+and+media/media+releases/fonterra+accepts+mpi+charges/fonterra+accepts+mpi+charges"> Fonterra manager</a> said: "We have accepted all four charges, which are consistent with the findings of our operational review and the Independent Board Inquiry."</p>
<p>The dairy co-operative has since stepped up its quality control procedures.</p>

<p>In August last year Fonterra sparked a worldwide product recall and food-safety scare when it admitted there could be a bacteria in one of its products which could cause botulism, a severe form of food poisoning. </p>
<p>The product suspected of containing the bacteria which could cause botulism was commonly used in infant formula. </p>
<p>But the bacteria scare turned out to be a false alarm when later tests found another strain, but of a less harmful kind which does not cause food poisoning.</p>
<p>The threat of botulism led to many countries including China blocking imports of dairy products from New Zealand. </p>
<p>The import ban was lifted about three weeks after the initial scare. </p>
<p>Fonterra is the biggest dairy firm in New Zealand, which is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.</p>
