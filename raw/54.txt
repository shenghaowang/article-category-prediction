<p>General Motors is buying back about 800 cars and trucks from their owners rather than try to repair serious safety defects in the vehicles.</p>
<p>While not many cars and trucks are involved, it is rare for an automaker to buy back a vehicle.</p>
<p>The GM cars and trucks involved in the buyback were returned from leases and rentals, then refitted with leather aftermarket upholstery. GM discovered that the occupant sensing system that determines when the front passenger airbag should be turned on or off was engineered only for the original cloth interior.</p>
<p>GM executives concluded that a buyback was in the best interests of the company and would be less disruptive to customers. The vehicles will be salvaged for parts.</p>
<p>The GM vehicles included in the buyback are the 2005-06 Buick LaCrosse and Rendezvous, Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy; 2006 Chevrolet HHR and Malibu, Hummer H3 and Pontiac G6; 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra and Pontiac Montana; and 2004 Chevrolet Silverado.</p>
