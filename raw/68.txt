Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with solid gains and hit a six-month high as more safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish posture  prompted buying interest. Gold futures rallied on Wednesday to mark their highest settlement since September, buoyed by tensions in Ukraine and a pullback for the equities markets linked to concerns over a slowdown in China's economy.
