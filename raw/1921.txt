<p><strong>On 11 March 2014, members of the Treasury Committee held an evidence session with Governor of the Bank of England, Dr Mark Carney. </strong></p>
<p>This session covered three issues: the Bank of England's February 2014 Inflation Report, the economics of currency unions and the Bank's Foreign Exchange Market Review.</p>
<p>Mr Carney gave evidence to the committee a week after minutes of meetings emerged suggesting Bank officials were aware of alleged foreign exchange rate fixing attempts as early as 2006. </p>
<p>Even though the bank said there was no evidence its staff had colluded to rig the market, one member of staff has been suspended over compliance concerns.</p>
<p>Joining Dr Carney to give evidence were:</p>
<p>-	Paul Fisher, executive director, markets, Bank of England </p>
<p>-	Professor David Miles, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England</p>
<p>-	Martin Weale, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England</p>
<p>-	Stephen Hughes, former chief executive, Birmingham City Council.</p>
