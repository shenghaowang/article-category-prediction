<p>DENVER – Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world’s first accounting of the recreational pot business. </p>
<p>The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes. </p>
<p>Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn’t begin until January. Washington sales begin in coming months. </p>
<p>The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado’s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January. </p>
<p>That’s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado’s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year. </p>
<p>Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations. </p>
<p>Monday’s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds. </p>
