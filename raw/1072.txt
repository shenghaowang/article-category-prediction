<p class="quote">
            India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea        </p>
<p class="p1">Sources have confirmed that sabotage is a real possibility with military-radar tracking evidence suggesting Flight MH370 could have been flown hundreds of miles off course towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, north-west of Malaysia.</p>
<p class="p1">A senior Malaysian police official said inquiries were focusing increasingly on the theory that someone who knew how to fly a plane deliberately diverted the Boeing 777, with 239 people on board, off its intended course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p class="p1">A U.S official in Washington said that investigators are examining the possibility of "human intervention" in the plane's disappearance, adding it may have been "an act of piracy."</p>
<p class="p1">The official, who wasn't authorised to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, also said it was possible the plane may have landed somewhere.</p>
<p class="p1">India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea as search efforts continue to expand.</p>
<p class="p1">Two Indian air force reconnaissance planes flew over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after they and two naval ships and two coast guard vessels scoured the surrounding seas without finding evidence of the plane.</p>
<p class="p1">A spokesman declined to give details about the rest of the search operation, including the use of technologies such as the heat sensors aboard the Dornier planes.</p>
<p class="p1">The Andaman and Nicobar archipelago stretches south of Myanmar and contains 572 islands covering an area of 447-by-32 miles. </p>
<p class="p1">Only 37 are inhabited, with the rest covered in dense forests.</p>

<p class="p2">As the search for the missing plane entered its seventh day, a senior Malaysian police official said: "What we can say is we are looking at sabotage, with hijack still on the cards." </p>
<p class="p2">Two sources said an unidentified aircraft believed to be Flight MH370 was following a route between navigational waypoints - indicating it was being flown by someone with aviation training - when it was last plotted on military radar off Malaysia’s northwest coast. </p>
<p class="p2">The position suggested the plane was flying toward India's Andaman Islands, which lie between the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p class="p2">That would mean it flew for up to five hours after the last contact and officials are now likely to have to dramatically extend the current 27,000sq nautical mile search area out into the vast Indian Ocean. </p>
<p class="p2">Malaysian police have previously said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. </p>
<p class="p2">The comments by the three sources are the first clear indication that foul play is the main focus of official suspicions in the Boeing 777's disappearance. </p>
<p class="p2"> Earlier reports that two passengers boarded the plane with stolen passports sparked speculation the plane could have been hijacked by terrorists, but the theory weakened after Malaysian authorities determined that one of them was an Iranian seeking asylum in Europe. </p>
<p class="p2">Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said: "We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group.”</p>
<p class="p2"> Speaking at a press conference this morning, the country’s transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said they were looking into the possibilty one of the pilots may have been involved. </p>
<p class="p2"> He also said the plane’s tracking systems could have been turned off by someone intentionally, or under duress.</p>
<p class="p2"> In the week that the plane has been missing, several other theories have been put forward.</p>

<p class="p2"> The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were “Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace.</p>
<p class="p2"> Retired British Airways pilot Alastair Rosenschein believes Flight MH 370 has plunged into the Indian Ocean half way between Madagascar and Australia.</p>
<p class="p2"> Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he claimed the Malaysian jetliner is around 5,000 miles away from where rescuers are looking in the South China Sea after flying on a course set by the pilots before the crew passed out from a drop in cabin pressure.</p>
<p class="p2">He said: "The initial reaction for pilots in that case would be to put on oxygen masks immediately.</p>
<p class="p2"> "However, had they failed to do that the next option would be to turn off the airway in order to do a rapid descent.</p>
<p class="p2">"Without the oxygen masks they would have passed out within a few seconds.</p>
<p class="p2">"That would have left the aircraft on autopilot heading in whichever direction they had turned the aircraft on the autopilot.</p>
<p class="p2">"I'm suggesting that they would have made that initial heading a reciprocal one back towards Kuala Lumpur airport.</p>
<p class="p2"> "That doesn't mean they turned the aircraft directly and exactly toward Kuala Lumpur airport it could quite happily have been a parallel track with the airway.</p>
<p class="p2">"With the fuel on board that would put the aircraft finally as it ran out out of fuel, with everybody unconscious on board, somewhere around the mid-Indian Ocean which is thousands of miles away from where they're looking at present.</p>
<p class="p2">"The worst case scenario for the location of the aircraft would be half-way between Madagascar and Australia, a very very difficult area to search and of course a huge area."</p>
<p class="p2">Satellite images released by Chinese authorities earlier this week appeared to show the outline of a plane's wreckage floating in between the Gulf of Thailand the South China Sea. </p>
<p class="p2">But Malaysia's transport minister said the pictures do not show the wreckage of the missing aircraft and were released by mistake and a Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency surveillance plan had been dispatched to the area and had found nothing. </p>
<p class="p2">Mr Hussein also dismissed a report by the Wall Street Journal that MH 370 kept flying for several hours after it lost contact, claiming teams from Boeing and Rolls Royce confirmed engine data cited in the article was inaccurate. </p>
<p class="p2">He added that all the necessary pre-flight checks and maintenance work had been carried out on the plane and dispelled rumours police have searched the homes of the pilots. </p>
<p class="p2">Some 57 ships and 48 aircraft from 13 countries are now taking part in the operation, which covers 27,000 square nautical miles from the South China Sea to India's territorial waters.</p>
<p class="p2">Satellite pictures of the Gulf of Thailand have now been uploaded to the web and members of the public are being urged to help the search from home. </p>
<p class="p2">Colorado based company DigitalGlobe have uploaded the images to tomnod.com and are asking volunteers to point out “anything that looks interesting, any signs of wreckage or life rafts."</p>
<p class="p2">Several witnesses have come forward, claiming to have spotted the plane. </p>
<p class="p2">New Zealand worker Mike McKay claimed to have witnessed the Malaysia Airlines plane "come down" in flames.</p>
<p class="p2">Speaking to ABC News, he said: "I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right.</p>
<p class="p2">"I observed (the plane) burning at high altitude. </p>
<p class="p2">"While I observed the burning (plane) it appeared to be in one piece." </p>

<p>Indonesia and Thailand, which lie on either side of the northern part of the Malacca Strait, have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace. </p>
<p>A senior military officer who had been briefed on the investigation said the missing aircraft had made a detour to the west after communications with civilian authorities ended. </p>
<p>"It changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude. It made it into the Malacca Strait," the officer said. </p>
<p>A  non-military source familiar with the investigations said the reported detour was one of several theories and was being checked. </p>
<p>If the plane had made such a detour it would undermine the theory that it suffered a sudden, catastrophic mechanical failure, as it would mean it flew at least 350 miles after its last contact with air traffic control. </p>
<p>In the absence of any concrete evidence to explain the plane's disappearance, authorities have not ruled out anything.</p>
<p>Witnesses have come forward, claiming to have spotted the plane.</p>
<p>Mike McKay, a New Zealander working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Thailand, sent an email Vietnamese authorities saying he spotted what could have been a burning plane 200 miles southeast of Vung Tau.</p>
<p>Police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.</p>
<p>The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were “Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace.</p>
<p>Another possibility being looked into by authorities is that one of the pilots committed suicide. </p>
<p>John Brennan, head of the US Central Intelligence Agency said: “I think you cannot discount any theory.” </p>

<p class="p2">The confusion over where to look is adding to one of the most baffling mysteries in modern aviation history, and prolonging the agonising wait for hundreds of relatives. </p>
<p class="p2">Relatives frustrated with the lack of communication by the authorities have threatened to take legal action. </p>
<p class="p2">One , who didn’t want to give her name, said: "We are definitely going sue them. This is really bad. (We are not suing) Malaysia Airlines, but the Malaysian government.” </p>
<p class="p2">At a meeting between airline officials and members of the Malaysian embassy, relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers vented their frustration over the lack of information about the fate of their loved ones. </p>
<p class="p2">When officials refused to discuss what was known, at least three people threw bottles and some lunged towards the speakers.</p>
<p class="p2">Others shouted “tell us the truth” and demanded the Malaysian military reveal what they knew about the missing plane.</p>
