<p data-page="1">Recreational marijuana sales in Colorado brought in more than $2 million in tax revenue in January, according to state figures released Monday.</p>
<p>At the behest of voters who approved legalized marijuana in 2012, Colorado is still in the early days of a regulatory experiment expected to bring in millions in tax revenue from legal sales.</p>
<p>January was the first month for such sales in Colorado. Washington state, which also legalized recreational marijuana in a voter initiative, is preparing for a June launch date for recreational marijuana sales.</p>
<p>The roughly $2 million raised in January came from three different taxes: a 10% retail marijuana sales tax, a 15% marijuana excise tax and a 2.9% state sales tax, the state said.</p>
<p>The marijuana taxes, when first approved, were projected to bring in about $70 million in the industry's first year, <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/results/2013-2014/PropositionAAText.pdf" target="_blank">according to a separate ballot measure</a> posed to voters in November. The first $40 million raised by the excise tax must go to a school construction fund.</p>
<p>That tax netted $195,318 for the state's school fund from January sales, according to the figures <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1251950872953&amp;ssbinary=true" target="_blank">released by the Colorado Department of Revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Fifty-nine recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25314108/colorado-saw-2-million-recreational-marijuana-taxes-january" target="_blank">the Denver Post reported</a>, a figure that was expected to grow, as 167 stores had been approved for recreational marijuana sales as of the end of February.</p>
