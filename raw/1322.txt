By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off. It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off. It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off. It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off. It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off. It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar.

"It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use.

"This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar.

It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off.

"It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off.

It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off.

It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar.

It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said. Instead, searchers are trying to use the handshakes to triangulate the general area of where the plane last was known to have been at the last satellite check, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"It is telling us the airplane was continuing to operate," the official said, plus enough information on location so that the satellite will know how many degrees to turn to adjust its antenna to pick up any messages from the plane.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official confirmed prior reports that following the loss of contact with the plane's transponder, the plane turned west. A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators.

The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off.

"It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use.

It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

A transponder emits signals that are picked up by radar providing a unique identifier for each plane along with altitude.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Malaysian military radar continued to pick up the plane as a whole "paintskin" - a radar blip that has no unique identifier - until it traveled beyond the reach of radar, which is about 320 kilometers offshore, the official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The <em>New York Times</em>, quoting American officials and others familiar with the investigation, said radar signals recorded by the Malaysian military appear to show the airliner climbing to 13,700 metres, higher than a Boeing 777's approved limit, soon after it disappeared from civilian radar, and making a sharp turn to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The radar track then shows the plane descending unevenly to an altitude of 7,000 metres, below normal cruising levels, before rising again and flying northwest over the Strait of Malacca toward the Indian Ocean, the <em>Times</em> reported.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><!--for each ends--></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said.

The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar.

It was flying across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia towards Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said satellite data confirmed that an unidentified aircraft that later appeared on military radar off Malaysia's west coast before going out of range at 2:15 a.m. was flight MH370.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said analysis of the plane's last communication with satellites placed it in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Two routes</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Earlier, a source familiar with official US assessments of electronic signals sent to satellites said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The other interpretation was that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Two sources familiar with the investigation in Malaysia told Reuters on Friday that military radar data showed the aircraft following a commonly used commercial, navigational route towards the Middle East and Europe.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That course - headed into the Andaman Sea and towards the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean - could only have been set deliberately, either by flying the jet manually or by programming the auto-pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The disappearance of the Boeing 777 - one of the safest commercial jets in service - is shaping into one of the most baffling mysteries in aviation history.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>It is extremely rare for a modern passenger aircraft to disappear once it has reached cruising altitude, as MH370 had.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>When that does happen, the debris from a crash is usually found close to its last known position relatively quickly.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In this case, there has been no trace of the plane, nor any sign of wreckage, as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The maximum range of the Boeing 777 is 7,725 nautical miles or 14,305 km. It is not clear how much fuel the aircraft was carrying though it would have been enough to reach its scheduled destination, Beijing, a flight of five hours and 50 minutes.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><br/><strong>South China Sea search for jet called off</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p> <br/>Prime Minister Razak said on Saturday that Malaysia was ending a search in the South China Sea for a vanished jetliner after investigations indicated the missing plane likely turned far to the west.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"We are ending our operation in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of our assets," Najib told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane hijacked, official says</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>A Malaysian investigation into the missing flight 370 has concluded that one or more people with flying experience switched off communications devices and deliberately steered the airliner off-course, a Malaysian government official involved in the investigation said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official called the disappearance a hijacking, though he said no motive has been established and no demands have been made known. It's not yet clear where the plane ended up, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official said a deliberate takeover of the plane was no longer a theory. "It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use. As the phone from passes from the range of one cellphone tower to another, the towers note that the phone is in range in case messages need to be sent.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>In the case of the Malaysian plane, there were successful attempts by the satellite to roughly locate the Boeing 777 about once an hour over four to five hours, the official said. "This is all brand new to us," the official said. "We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators.

"It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use.

"It is conclusive," he said, indicating that investigators were ruling out mechanical failure or pilot error in the disappearance.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He said evidence that led to the conclusion were signs that the plane's communications were switched off deliberately, data about the flight path and indications the plane was steered in a way to avoid detection by radar.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Boeing 777's communication with the ground was severed just under one hour into a Malaysia Airlines flight March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Another US official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators looking for the plane have run out of clues except for a type of satellite data that has never been used before to find a missing plane, and is very inexact.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The data consists of attempts by an Inmarsat satellite to identify a broad area where the plane might be in case a messaging system aboard the plane should need to connect with the satellite, said the official.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The official compared the location attempts, called a "handshake," to someone driving around with their cellphone not in use.

"We've never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The handshake does not transmit any data on the plane's altitude, airspeed or other information that might help in locating it, the official said.

By noting that investigators had not yet concluded that the episode was a hijacking, Najib seemed to leave open the possibility that the cockpit crew might have chosen to take the aircraft to an unknown destination.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Meanwhile, relatives of the flight’s 153 Chinese passengers said in Beijing that Najib’s remarks did little to ease their nerves. “I feel [Malaysia Airlines] had a role to play in this incident,” Wen Wancheng, a man from east China whose son is among the passengers on the flight, told reporters.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Several passengers’ relatives said after a two-hour meeting with airline representatives in Beijing earlier yesterday that they were frustrated with the lack of definite information on the plane’s whereabouts.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As emotions over the missing plane continued to run high, China’s official Xinhua news agency ratcheted up its criticism of Malaysian authorities, suggesting that either a “dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information” was to blame.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators.

<p>Sepang, Malaysia: The hunt for flight MH370 took a dramatic new turn on Saturday after the Malaysian Prime Minister said the missing jetliner’s air communications system and transponder had been deliberately switched off by someone on board before the Boeing 777 turned back and flew northwest.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib Razak also said that search efforts in the South China Sea had been ended, and that technical experts now believed that the aircraft could have ended up anywhere in one of two zones — one as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia, and the other crossing the southern Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That conclusion was based on a final signal from the plane picked up on satellite at 8.11 am on March 8, nearly seven hours after ground control lost contact with the jet, he said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>While Najib said that investigators had not ruled out alternatives to hijacking, his remarks represented official confirmation that the disappearance of the Boeing 777-200 a week earlier had not been an accident.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>He noted that one communications system had been disabled as the plane flew over the northeast coast of Malaysia and that a second system, a transponder aboard the aircraft, had stopped broadcasting its location, altitude, speed and other information at 1.21 am while the plane was one-third of the way across the Gulf of Thailand from Malaysia to Vietnam.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib’s news conference came a day after American officials told The New York Times that Flight 370 had experienced significant changes in altitude after it lost contact with ground control, and altered its course more than once as if still under the command of a pilot.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Military radar data subsequently showed that the aircraft turned and flew west across northern Malaysia before arcing out over the wide northern end of the Strait of Malacca, headed at cruising altitude for the Indian Ocean.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The Seventh Fleet of the United States Navy said in a statement yesterday that its search for the plane now encompassed the Strait of Malacca and beyond to the Bay of Bengal — an enormous area.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But Najib said that representatives of many more governments across the region had been contacted, since the plane might have been flying for many hours after it left Malaysian airspace.

<p>According to a person who has been briefed on the investigation, the two “corridors” that officials were focusing on were derived from calculations made by engineers from the satellite communications company Inmarsat, which were provided to investigators. The northern arc described by Najib passes through or close to some of the world’s most volatile countries that are home to insurgent groups, but also over highly militarized areas with robust air defense networks, some run by the US military. The arc passes close to northern Iran, through Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, and through northern India and the Himalayan mountains and Myanmar. The southern arc, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean, travels over open water with few islands stretching all the way to Antarctica.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Mikael Robertsson, a co-founder of Flightradar24, a global aviation tracking service, said the Boeing’s transponder was switched off just as the plane passed from Malaysian to Vietnamese air traffic control space, thus making it more likely that its absence from communications would not arouse attention.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Crew, passengers under scrutiny</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Confirmation that a missing Malaysian airliner was deliberately diverted suggests several scenarios that will sharpen scrutiny of the cockpit crew and passengers known to have boarded with stolen passports.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Saturday that satellite and radar data clearly indicated the plane's automated communications had been disabled and the plane then turned away from its intended path and flown on for hours.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane," he said, adding that investigators had consequently "refocused their investigation into crew and passengers on board."<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Pilot's home searched</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police began searching the home of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on Saturday, after the country's prime minister confirmed the plane was suspected to have been deliberately diverted, a senior police official said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Police officers arrived at the home of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, on Saturday afternoon, shortly after Prime Minister Najib Razak ended his news conference.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators had confirmed that an aircraft tracked by military radar was the lost Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after its communications were likely switched off before it reached the east coast of Malaysia a week ago, Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p><strong>Plane 'deliberately' diverted</strong><!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Investigators believe someone aboard a missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>"Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate," Najib said.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>The fate the of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>But investigators have increasing focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the one of the pilots or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11am Malaysian time.<!-- Fact Box description starts here--><!-- Fact Box description ends here--><p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off.

<p>for finding  missing plane location the following data may usefull toknow approximate location 1) total fuel present in tank after missingits control 2)possible speed of plane1)if its max,2)minimum and3)average plane can reach in kilometers 3)possible direction plane canmove  4)before manual operation animation is necessary (trial and errormethod)</p>
<p>Instead of tracing the location of the aircraft, families should starttracing the location of passenger's phone. TELECOM &amp; MOBILEcompanies can help in the search for mobile phone location while it isstill switch on which can be traced to its location.</p>
<p>I've watched in Discovery, animals and Fish are getting tagged byscientists with devices which will enable to track and pin point thesubject anywhere in deep ocean. Why on earth these Air craft's whichcarry precious human life have any device which will help to pin pointits stationed location in case of catastrophe as such. Are we still instone age??</p>
<p>THERES MUST BE A CATCH IN THIS... </p>
<p>The manner the Malaysian govt has handled the unfortunate disappearanceof a sophisticated airliner is a mystery. To the extent, even themanufacturers have given less / no information to assist. Now we have 25countries involved? It is not about the number game but, transparencywith partners involved in the search and rescue rather than being adoubting Thomas !!! From the very beginning they were clueless and stillremain!!?? The authorities need to play their cards well and give therespective countries access to information they need to speed up thesearch and bring relief to the tormented families. Adding additionalcountries, planes and ships brings no solace to the mess the authoritieshave created over the past 10 days and still counting. If the need ofthe hour is transparency, then yes, a quick and thorough investigationshould be conducted on the MH 370 Captain and Co-Pilot / ground crew andfindings to be made known to the next of kin and the world at large.This is the worst case scenario of its kind for a sophisticatedcommercial airline’s history disappearance globally.  Malaysia isa well-developed country with a pool of talented / skilled individualsfrom China and India who are the minority or non-Malays. Are they beingsuppressed from the mainstream of politics and, individual developmenthampered, cause, being a non-malay? Assuming this too has added to thefury, vented out by people across the globe on the Malaysian Govt Auth.in handling of the situation and its minorities. Families of thepassengers of MH370 need answers and now, before it’s too late !!!</p>
<p>This is really strange, In this world have great great technologies,Definitely there is high potential to find out this. I feel that stephas taken is not effective on search of this plane. If still officialcannot find, might aliens have taken this plane into their world.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the plane was taken by Aliens. No onewants to admit it.</p>
<p>The technology invented by HUMAN is not able to search the inventedtechnology.  The world do  not believe in  Unidentified FlyingObjects(UFO's) as there are no clear evidence behind it. I suspect thisincident could be related to Alien Abduction.</p>
<p>When you buy a Smartphone for $500, you have the capability ofdownloading some software which will help you track the phone if it getsstolen. And all this on a phone that costs only a few hundred dollars.However, we now have an airline that most probably cost around $100million dollars and no one can find it. That is amazing!!</p>
<p>Malaysia could have been more transparent when their Military radars hadtracked the flight movement. As this information was not shared themassive search operation had turned out to be a farce. A wasted effort.</p>
<p>I think from now on we all have to take our own Personal Locator Beaconswith us while travelling in airlines.  This incident is really a goodchallange for the Aviation Authorities and the Aircraft manufacturers inthis 21st century. I believe a new type of Aircraft Position LocatingEquipment with advanced technology is going to come in the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Since there is no proof available of the disappearance of flight, aswell more than 29 countries were searching and was not successful, whichis a fact no body can deny it. Best option is to give some space toMalaysian Offices to work out the location of flight. Rising and blamingMalaysian is an act of Coward.</p>
<p>A Greek Petrochemical Barge has found some debris along the Straights orMallacca, it was said in some newspapers.  How far is that true.  Havethey MAS authorities really gone to that area for survey.</p>
<p>Really this is pathetic, we are in 21st Century with advancedTechnology. Simple and sure Malaysian Government is playing with 239Souls. Past 9 Days still lagging to find missing plane even 22 Countriesare involved for searching it.</p>
<p>I don't know how it may sound but why don't authorities use metaldetectors or aluminium detectors used in aircraft to locate the plane injungles,bushes,Islands, etc.Plane might have crashed or something orlanded in remote or abandoned airports.Apart from top secrets Who kowswhat might have happened.</p>
<p>We all should avoid slandering the deceased when there is no concreteevidence. The argument that the transponder will never stop functioningis very hard to believe. There are cases in Air India Dreamlineraircrafts, transponder stopped functioning on route to Chicago fromDelhi, and the pilot returned to Delhi when it was over Afganistan.</p>
<p>Interested criticizers might lend a helping hand instead of  jibberjabber.It will mean alot. Gulfnews broadcasts factualinformation,nothing personal.Gulfews did not provoke anything when it comes to Pakistan.Lets us raise or hold handstogether for  MH370 ,the crew and family members going through toughtime.Blaming game wont help here,Let authorized people do theirqualified for duty and in the mean time we pray.</p>
<p>Is there any chance this plane could go to space? If it not in ground orsea, i think the next step should be searching in the SPACE!</p>
<p>I hope there was some suspicious persons or information board on thatplane and Malaysian Govt, callback the plane and it is under custody ofMalaysian air force. (in the first news the plane was u turned toMalaysia, the transponders are kept off by the instruction of air force.the plane must be under custody of Malaysian Air force.</p>
<p>If mobile phones/simcards could be used in coordiantin with personaldata given to airlines and countries telecomminication system to tracethe location</p>
<p>Its High time people stop blaming one another and rather look forreasons. For the acclaimed intellectuals  who feel they have knownall the mysteries of the world, this incident is an eye opener to seehow inadequate can technology be with all the support of :- find mygadgets, radar transmission, and satellite photographs that include picstaken every nano second....and yet no trace of the flight.  may be wehaven't thought of some force of nature which we have never actuallyencountered with so are walking clueless looking at only known facts.</p>
<p>Why they still not found the ringing telephone gps which area locatedthis tower..</p>
<p>What is interesting to me, as a pilot, is that whoever said"alright good night" certainly did not use standard pilotlingo. I assume that this was in response to a hand off from MalaysianATC to Vietnamese ATC. A standard response would go similar to asfollows "Kuala Lumpur Center, Roger Maylaysia 370 going to SaigonCenter on 128.6 Good Day" or some such thing. In other words, thepilot always repeats what has been transmitted to him, identifieshimself by callsign, and repeats the next frequency assigned. Could itbe that the person who said this was under duress, or not familiar withATC lingo?</p>
<p>To Malaysia Authority .  Have they check with Indonesia Aceh for furtherinvestigate??.  One of aceh fisherman saw the white plane turn aroundthe area very low and suddenly disappear.  He reported this incident toIndonesia TV news that the plane wind also caught fire.   I watch thisTV news from sallelite Indonesia today. 17.03.14</p>
<p>I think this is the biggest joke we have had in the 21st century. Howdoes an airline disappear mysteriously and its over a week now and allwe are hearing is lies? This is reprehensible</p>
<p>I think the Malaysian Air Force is the most suspicious.  We have beenhearing nothing but lies from the Malaysian government.  I think itmight have been an attempted attack like 9-11 but the plane was shotdown by the Malaysian Air Force.  To avoid international criticism, theMalaysian government has been using one lie to cover another.  Just waitand see!  What a sad incident indeed.</p>
<p>Would like to know what was the exchange with Air traffic control thatlead up to the last transmission of " Alright good night" DidATC hand off to Vietnam ATC? Did Vietnam ATC speak with the crew?</p>
<p>After the disappearance of the French airliner a few years ago, if ithad been mandatory for all airlines to subscribe to satellite servicenetworks, we would not be facing this ridiculous situation where aman-made object with 239 people aboard vanishes without a trace.   Aspassengers are we expected to also find out such details before trustingour loved ones or our lives in their care? The incident throws light onglaring discrepancies which should be addressed immediately.</p>
<p>Thats where people have to realize that whatever is not known to humans,Allah knows that... Allah has given its mankind lot of power and toolsto conquer this world but again we have to realize that only Allah knowsthe knowledge of the dark and the unknown. My request to all people isto pray to Allah to guide us and provide us the knowledge to knowreality of what actually had happened to MH370.</p>
<p>Malaysian Government is definitely hiding a lot of facts here and maybeto cover up their act the poor pilots are being cornered.  Come out withthe truth Malaysia, you cant hide facts forever. You are playing withhuman lives here.  I hope the 239 lives onboard are safe....</p>
<p>I have been watching television this evening, trying to understand thedisappearance of the plane and the possible loss of all the people onboard. Several people who commented here found hope in the fact thatpassengers'  cell phones still ring. Sadly, one of the guest experts a news channel said that cell phones will continue to ringwhether or not the phone is operational.</p>
<p>Dear all 'genius' commenters. I am Malaysian and I am appalled by theway you evaluating the situation and condemning my country. If your catwent missing you would search the area you believe you lost it. At themean time you are investigating all the possibilities why she is lost.You realized your cat went somewhere based on little evidence/ tracesyou find. You believed she went to your neighbour's house. You have toknock the door and ask for information. If your neighbour give littleinformation, you take it and have to expand your search. You also can'truled out possibility that your cat could be abducted. If this kind ofcommon sense you can't digest, you should check your brain and nottelling my people to do that. And one more thing, try to differentiateofficial press release by government and media speculations.. they alldifferent!</p>
<p>my paryer for those missing passengers. i think we are leaving some mainpoints here and picking unnecessary stuffs. Malaysia Govt. pls stop thisdrama and biring the truth. You have technology utilize it or else saythe truth that you are hiding for the shake of those 239 souls.</p>
<p>I thinks getting normal routine that what ever wrong happens in any partof the world, just blame it on Pakistan without any credible proof, 1thing is for sure Gulf news is losing its credibility, always defamingPakistan without getting the whole story.</p>
<p>I think they should verify is the final words of the pilot are that ofthe pilot himself or someone else!! might be someone else flying theaircraft by that time!!!  Possibility of a hijacking is less because nomobile signals have been picked up from any of the passengers mobiles!!</p>
<p>It’s a shame that mediaor any of the countries can’t find a missing plane in a high techworld of today. Blame anybody at random is equally shameful. Stopblaming; find the plane for heaven sake. I hope all are alive, Godforbids if not let the relatives know. It’s so hard for thosefamilies to know nothing. It’s a sad joke.</p>
<p>This is really horrable situation for all mankind, being in the mostadvance technology era if we dont able find missing huge aircraftm itsounds abnormal, either the authorities became irresposible or they aremaking fool of people, something went wrong and they want to hide them,come on man give a break continuesly giving all unrelated information,its not a girls small pendant or hearing which is lost somewhere and youpeople are searching its a huge aircraft with 239 people life involved,praying god to save them and their  livehood, all techonolgies advancereseaerched, projects all nothing they simply play with mankind, godplease help us and please dont blame other nation that hide aircraft,its you inefficeincy</p>
<p>May Allah protect and return all passenger safe and sound. How wrong ofpeople mentioning pakistan.</p>
<p>"Last communication came after shutdown began "  This says itwas definitely the pilot who communicated last since the shutoff is inthe cockpit.  It also proves the plane wasn't shut down.  The pilot Shahseemed a bit off - obsessive, etc - very sure he did this because Anwargoing to jail for 5 years earlier in the day...</p>
<p>If this is a hostile takeover or takeover by the pilots as part of aplot, then what country in it's right mind would give out all theinformation? Every intelligence and military resource available aroundthe world would be working to locate the plane and the perpetrators, andbring the incident to a conclusion with the least loss of life. PsyOps,NSAs and BlackOps, every anachronism out there would be working aroundthe clock, so expect to be kept in the dark and fed misinformation. Thenwait 30-40 years to hear the whole story of how it happened and how itwas resolved, if it is.</p>
<p>I am wondering if there are enough satellite pictures of the area toplay back from the plane's last "known location" that can thenverify through various numbers of satellites taking pictures atdifferent times, which can then track all the movements of the jet fromthe last location on to wherever the jet wound up.    Surely there areenough satellites in the sky and taking so many pictures, there is a wayto draw a line, even separating other jets</p>
<p>I think something going wrong because since the flight disappear firstMalaysia government said it can be crashed &amp; now the are saying itsgone somewhere. Why they did not check the satellite signals on same day&amp;  it really hard to believe Malaysia airlines not noticed by anymilitary radars . USA Will utilize this opportunity..., MayGod Almighty find  a way to find this plane soon</p>
<p>I say is it got sucked in by the alien mother ship which took off fromwater just when the flight 370 was above it and it has already beentransported to their world. The pings detected by the satellite waswhile the plane was still in the mother ship the reason why the pingsmovements can't be explained. The plane is definitely not on this planetand of course investigators will  say that anyway.</p>
<p>Remember, just because something is not made public can very well beestablished knowledge.. Then, unfortunately there are too many weirdcoincidences here, from the pilot's perhaps over-enthusiast backgroundall the way to multinational military operation Cobra Gold -that hastaken place near enough not too long ago- via the 20 employees ofFreescale Semiconductor on this flight (it's high profile in relatedfield of expertise could be relevant in this case), and those 5 who inthe end did not board the flight though checked in, to allow forspeculation. Such a pilot is an easy target to blame for sophisticatedmaneuvers, but why someone of his caliber would want to damage hisprofessional legacy? And passengers can somehow just miss their flightseven form the terminal.. and important engineers flown in a whole groupas they were not suspecting anything wrong.. and maybe indeed there wasno higher-than-average military coverage in the region as they allquickly dispersed after the exercise.. Then again, common people wouldand will not know all the facts and whether they are of relevance. Evenless of what technology is REALLY capable of, be it mobile phones (toonaive to expect they'd work in the middle of nowhere) or satellites butespecially top-secret military gadgets. Forget stationary radars, thereis more to near-Earth surveillance, AWACS -Boeing E-3 Sentry is commonknowledge but there can be others and surely such info is not ourbusiness. To expect to be told of the whole picture in every detail is achildhood fantasy. Just feeling sorry for all the innocent peopleinvolved, and their loved ones who cannot have a closure. And yetbelieving it must have been a far less malicious event -if not innocent-than what it's starting to be painted as..</p>
<p>We don't need anyadditional half baked conspiracy theories, thanks!  The pilot knew whathe was doing. he reversed course and stayed on the path of commercialtravel, so no one would notice the aircraft's position as being unusual.Why? I don't know, but I am not going to blame someone either. Let'swait and see what we discover, and MAYBE these people are alivesomewhere? My thoughts are with the families.</p>
<p>Why are these tracking devices made so they can be disabled?  Ought tobe a GPS  or some other device that cannot be touched or changed.</p>
<p>Taxis in Abudhabi, Dubai and Sharjah Emirates have GPS . This helps theauthorities to track down a car even if it's parked deep in the desert.GPS system is implemented in Dubai school buses also. Strange that anaircraft cannot be tracked because its communication devices was shut.Is it such n easy job. There is foul play in this. The pilots can be theculprits. Suppose someone had instructed them at gun point, theywould've somehow alerted the danger. Here it's all planned.</p>
<p>In this day of technology where apparently NSA known what we ate fordinner as Mr. Snowden claims, we can not find 200 feet long airliner israther unbelievable............</p>
<p>Nobody is talking because they are not able to verify what have alwaysbeen considered the most likely choices.  It is time to consider thepossibility that someone  actually hacked the autopilot to take over theplane.  This was done twice to US Drones.  </p>
<p>Just heard an expert comment on CNN, saying accident history shows many,many passenger jet pilots don't have the necessary skills to control andfly the big aircraft when the automatic flight equipment fails and theyhave to revert to manual flying. Now that's really scary for the flyingpublic -- pilots who don't actually know how to fly and control theaircraft they are supposedly in charge of.</p>
<p>I think world should be more technologically advanced and hence need todivert all the funds meant for Mars and other bodies.  Make our worldsafe and try to reach Mars.  How come the earth is not your hand and youare trying to control Mars.... Hope a clear message to our scientist.</p>
<p>where r we in this world? They make movies showing tech that no humancan imagine and on the other side can't locate a plane. Kudos to peoplewho blame Pakistan for everything!! People who blame others  are on a searchmission of a black sheep to sacrifice on their behalf...</p>
<p>Perhaps someone monitoring the radar systems was paid tolook the other way when the plane flew back over the country..... Also,why no word on whether authorities are checking the cell phone recordsof the passengers? Surely someone sent a text or made a cell phone callif they thought the plane was in distress. If no one did, then it mustbe foul play.</p>
<p>If the aircraft was flown to Pakistan, then it would naturally fly overIndia. Any aircraft that has to fly over Indian Airspace or particularlyany country's airspace has to notify the nearest ATC of that country.India didn't receive any such notification from any unknown aircraft.Secondly, the aircraft doesn't have that much fuel to make trip toPakistan without crossing over India.  So, think again beforemaking assumptions.</p>
<p>The entire investigation by the Malaysian authorities is a sham. Tobegin with the PM gives a press conference after 8 days, an honourableminister is not able to differentiate between races, their radarmisfires and the plane seemingly heads to the west (MalaccaStraits)...and all search and rescue initially by 12 countries areInterestingly conducted (as instructed by the ministry) in the east(South China Sea)???!!! With no debris being spotted, initially theauthorities were focused on passengers travelling on stolen passports,they are not even aware how much aviation fuel was loaded, so manyunanswered questions and Malaysia is wooing tourists ??? Claiming thecountry to be truly Asia?. The govt authorities had enough time toconduct background checks beginning with the Captain/co-pilot/cabincrew. Why the same were not conducted from the very 1st / 2nd day? Eventhe co-pilot  Fariq Abdulla who entertained two women in the cockpit in2011 from take-off to landing, has not been investigated till date.Thorough investigation about the captain and co-pilot background checkspre-flight need to be shared with the next of kin / media so as not tospeculate. Now the blame game has shifted to passengers and claims madethat certain countries are avoiding sharing information about theircitizens. Time to stop blaming advanced technology and own up to theirfolly. The Malaysian authorities need to put their heads together andsort out their differences. Imagine this is the biggest task undertakenin aviation history involving 25 nations, 43 ships and 58 aircraftssearching for an advanced, highly sophisticated and safest commercialaircraft B 777 operating for the past 18 years worldwide and the endresult….as claimed by the Transport/Defence Minister... simplyVanished!!! with no clue !!??. The crime is in their own backyard tillsuch time the authorities come clean about the cabin crew and thoroughinvestigation at ground level. Even their military radar were not ableto notify their personnel for a stray aircraft overflying Malaysianairspace ??? This calls for a Hollywood thriller.</p>
<p>There were more than 200 passengers on board. This is so tragic and sadsituation where we are relying on incomplete technical records to cometo a logical conclusion. Why are we looking to options of hijacking orcrew background checking? Why are we not looking to the straight forwardoption of technical failure wherein Pilot would have been so helplessand clueless and with tremendous pressure to save passengers lives. Itmight be a case of short circuit where Pilot would have deliberatelyunplugged the electrical components to save the aircraft from any sourceof fire. Also finding that he is lost his track path , he would haveturned the aircraft back to seek Malaysian ATC help by any availablefrequency range to communicate. Seemingly to have lost navigationalwaypoints and thus all  hope of safely landing , he would have decidedto consume all fuel before deliberate crashing so as to avoid any fire.He would have exhausted fuel before reaching safe island and must havecrashed in Indian ocean or forested Andaman island. This might be apossibility considering the credulous professional career of the pilotand crews. Why are we not thinking on this line?</p>
<p>Sad that plane is still traced out, and the life of manypassenger is on risk; I pray to Almighty Allah for the safety ofpassenger....</p>
<p> To T Siddiqui, you said you are 100% sure that this was shot down byAmerican. It seemed that you are involved on it because you are verysure on your statement. Why dont you help those investigator to shine alight? Or better investigator/INTERPOL  should track you for yourinvolvement and knowledge on this? Such a comment no brainer comment.</p>
<p>We earthlings are not alone!</p>
<p>I don't think this was flown over Paksitan or anywhere else to theNorth. Even if transponder is deactivated, it can still be detected onradar but no identification, it will show as unamed/unsignatured dot onthe radar screen. The military radars from the countries where it flewwill be able track it and for sure those countries and would have beenallerted and scrambled their fighter-interceptor jets if a suspiciousun-identified aircraft is flying over their territory. As my personalopinion, I'm smelling a conspiracy or  the  Malaysian government is nottelling the truth to the public. I hope all passengers will be safe.</p>
<p> Kudos to Gulf News! What a dsitressing headline. Media was speculatingon a lot of options. There's no significant speculation in mainstream"media" worldwide that said that Pakistan might be responsiblefor this disappearance. And lo and behold Gulf News in its gray style ofjournalism smears Pakistan's image again. How about 200 headlines on themainpage, each stating a name of a random country name and then sayingthat it is not a suspect. Gray journalism at its best. For God's sakeGulf News! stop giving negative press to Pakistan in your main headlineswhen there is very very little backing or significance to that report.</p>
<p>I think something going wrong because since the flight dissappre firstmalaysia goverment said it can  be crashd and now the are saying itsgone somewhere.why they did not check the settelite signals on same day...... i think malaysia goverment involed in this full drama....  BY theway hows plane can go to pakistan if there is no pakistani....also thereare few airports where he can land..... The story gone from malaysia topakistan. i have to remind them who says that the plane went to pakistanthat we have strong relatioship with china like brothers . if malaysiacan not find the plane then they should hire like FBI,ISI and RAW. i amsure they will get result within one week. tnx</p>
<p>What a joke!!!!  My prayers are with the passengers &amp; their familiesback home. But to be honest i feel the plan has crashed somwhere deepinto the sea or somewhere on the unmanned islands..no one an wait till 9days for ransome demand..i dont think any one is so generous to providefood to 239 people, or to keep a boeing 777 as a pet.. Missing of thisplane is a shame for so called advanced world &amp; theirtechnologies..once again blame culture is in the air..they can blame anyone for their failures. Where are the technologyexperts?????????????????????????????????????</p>
<p>Is it a surprise to all that MH370 disappeared without any trace? Thenwhat about 911 incident, where did the million tons steels and cementsdisappear in few minutes???  Where did the water tanks which run inmillions of gallons disappear???</p>
<p>Apart from all the conspiracy theories, the most ridiculous is that thePlane is hidden somewhere in Pakistan, well never know if later Americahas to do a stealth operation to recover that plane from some of the suburbs......</p>
<p>Ayyo! Firstly may God protect them and unite them with their loved ones.It's such a terrible news.  @sulaiman what kind of insensitive personwrites such comments. This is a very sad moment for mankind. What ifthey dont like McDonalds? I pray that no one faces such event. Worst ofall fastfood is very unhealthy.</p>
<p>Its very sad and at the same time surprising and funny that none ofmilitary radars of any country captured and unindentified aircraftflying over its airspace and waters. Come on and give me a break.</p>
<p>God help them. I am boarding a 777 now and I hope its safe. Maybe we candrop some McDonalds around the Andaman islands and if there aresurvivors they can have it. B777 reserved.</p>
<p>I don't understand that if the phones are ringing as we have heared news before why they cant able to locate the plane according to the mobile signals They can trace from mobile signals that where the plane is located and if the plane is crashed in INDIAN OCEAN how the phones are ringing when the plane crashed and gone in water. There should be special communication between plane and the control room which a person cant able to close from the plane inside even if someone want to do it delibrately.</p>
<p>In my own opinion.. this plane landed safely somewhere else, already hidthe plane and maybe repainted it for a possible reason, suicide airplanecrash.. How? maybe the plane was maneuver by someone who is skillfulenough to fly the thing.. and turned off all the security signals, pointa gun to the pilots head..  Or there's a conspiracy going on here.. ifthe plane designated on the air, well at least there should be debris onthe sea but there's nothing. and if the plane had gone down directly tothe sea, there would be no debris cause  the plane is still in onepiece... Still a mystery, a puzzle to all.</p>
<p>This shows the inefficiency of a country.Sometime the developingcountries development and efficiency are largely inflated ,when it cometo the point of the performance they all lack behind a big time.</p>
<p>100% sure America missiled this aircraft &amp; hiding there fault.</p>
<p>Now onwards all the countries should directly connect Black boxes of theflights to the country's satellites, so that anything happens, rescueteam can  easily trace out the flight locations. It is strange to knowthat no big action has been taken after 9/11 flight attacks.</p>
<p>May God Almighty find a way to find this plane soon.</p>
<p>Ordinary citizens of the world are really concerned that how an aircraftwith 239 people disappeared just because some people had switched offthe transponders.Is that the only way to track it down, I believe allpassenger aircraft now look for some alternative options at once. Howcome a jumbo aircraft is untraceable when an ordinary car can be trackedthrough GPS, etc. Information is really missing. The complete silence ofworld master is also noticeable.</p>
<p>real joke of 2014 - plane not found in radar . now problem is if planetravelled fromthailand,india,pakisthan,china,vietnam,indonesia,malaysia,bangladesh,afghanistan, what military people doing and they just keepradar to show other countries that we having radar-  it really hard tobelieve malysia airlines not noticed by any military radars</p>
<p>This is a very sad plight of the missing passengers I can just imaginethe families of the loved one every day must a hope for them. The pressrelease by the Malaysian authorities was very vague it did not make anysense besides the news threads that we have been following.It is acoincidence MH 370 is the date and month the flight went missing March7th only experts can understand this language. Now they say the planetook a turn and headed over to Malaysia and still  the Malaysiangovernment cannot find any data??? it looks very funny. The only countrywho can really help is USA they have NASA satellite to track even thetinniest object I feel for the sake of the innocent lives Malaysia andAmerica must compromise without Malaysia feeling their air traffic spacewill be violated. It will be one of the great humiliations in the airtraffic industry if someone claims for this attack.By all the vagueanswers given by the media it only makes it vunerable to the plotters ofthis incident</p>
<p>Its just really hard to believe that of millions of people / countriesinvolved in the search and with the modern technology we are havingnowadays, still nobody knew exactly what happened?..</p>
<p>There must be GPS  mechanism within air craft in hidden location  out ofthe reach of any human and trackable via Satellite. Moreover, securityneed to be enhanced inside  aircraft.</p>
<p>the deliberate action to switch off the transponder and to veer offcourse could have lead to air disaster to another flight coming fromother direction, and could have been fatal for all innocent lives onboard...however still the motive is not clear..lets wait and see whatcomes next ?</p>
<p>If the Malaysian Government concluded that the plane was hijacked, whythere are no demands from the hijackers? again we can conclude that theplance did not land but crashed, maybe in the Indian Ocean. Trysearching the whole Indian Ocean please....</p>
<p>I am sure that some of the passengers on board may have some RFIDenabled cards or IDs. Is it possible to track them using this?</p>
<p>Its a shame on the entire system and the developed technologies. Theculprits are laughing all the way to their motive! This reminds of 9/11when the entire world was in terror and shock, a similar mastermind isbehind this and their main objective is to spread terror in the minds ofpeople..AGAIN! The whole system has been proved like a JOKE...beingunable to find such a massive 777 PLANE...Absolutely ridiculous! It'salso a shame that such masterminds are actually criminals and not partof the government who could put their brains to good use.</p>
<p>The Malaysian authorities say that they don't know how much fuel wasloaded in the aircraft, What kind of records do they keep? If the planecrashed it will not float on the water for 6 or 7 days, must have beendrowned by now. They should try to search it underwater. if thesatallite cannot find it on land surface it will sure be underwater.More over it's not a tiny aircraft that will dissappear some where ucan't find it? When it comes to find a terrorist US will put all it'sresources to search and capture him or her, but when it comes to find ahuge plane they have no clues. That Ridiculous! Try Harder Is What WeWill Always Say.</p>
<p>In this world of high-tech technology, an aircrafts is missing for morethan a week with no clue to detect it. There are 2 concerns, 1) Is itnot possible to locate the flight from the mobile which some passengersrelatives claimes to be ringing? 2) As it is claimed that the flightsupposedly took a turn, can they not check the fuel capacity and the maxmiles it can cover with the same. and concentrate the look out on thatrange? I really hope God's miracle to happen and get all the passengersand crew safe and back at the earliest to unite with their family.</p>
<p>Malaysian government and their investigating agencies are  under totalconfusion.  If no, there is some deliberate attempt  from their side tohide the factors.</p>
<p>i doubt this is a game played well....Malaysia airline staffs are awareof this but they are just trying to hide something from the public!!!</p>
<p>I think (I wish, I am wrong) that there is a strong presence of US navyat the region. They are always experimenting / creating deadly weaponsto kill humans with their trillion dollar military budget. Maybemistakenly their some deadly weapon goes wrong and then they clear thedebris to save their name. Otherwise, how come in 21st century a planelike 777 can vanish without trace?. Huge military presence, whole regioncovered with layers of radar networks / satellites surveillance etc.</p>
<p>We must need to understand which country is blowing the case. UShijacked airplane as they want to put pressure on Pakistan or Iran. Asthey have started this campaign through their well supported lollipopmedia.  We need to keep eye on the aircraft will land in Afghanistanbecause US will bright that all hostages and left them at the boarder ofPakistan or Iran, We know very well US already preparing such operationin Pakistan (waziristan area) so they need to have some bases for shootinnocent people. In ad-hock view we also know Pakistan and China havegood relation and just last week China has announced they will investUSD 32 billion in Pakistan. this news may be not digestible to american.then they prepare such plan to put hurdles in China Pak relations.</p>
<p>My opinion, It was not crashed i am sure it was delibretly divertlocation.Plan's boarded high profile pessanger form China,communicationsystem was disabled hijacked (not by hijcker some well trainned militarypersonals ) and landed in unkonw destination (land used under jet airbase in the ocean controlle by miltry base could be someone high profilemilitry)  Where is technology? Not toady not tomorrow but in the endtruth will be disclose.</p>
<p>I think they should check flight 370 in Antarctica as there is no cluewhat so ever for more than a week. Its not Hijacked (No Demands havebeen made) and there is no sign of crash anywhere near or far within itssupposed route. Then either its crashed  or landed near or inAntarctica. I know its sounds weird but by checking it out will cause no harm.</p>
<p>God mercy to all those 239 passangers on board.I strongly believe thesepassanger maybe alive.Just trapped somewhere.Perhaps,there was a manmade run away on a desert,where the plane could be refuelled withoutdetection and then take off to unknown destination.Possibility of planefly at 7000 feet below recommended flying altitude to boeing 777 is oneclue.Remember this plane flew at night.God keep them alive,if alive tillthey rejoin with families and relative.Lets keep on praying,prayersmoves mountains.</p>
<p>May God Take Care of all the people on board</p>
<p>This is so distressing.. My prayers go out for the families and friendsof those on board the flight. God Bless</p>
<p>Malaysia now confirms its been hijacked, so where on earth has itlanded.  Why cant the satelites spot them, if they can spot terroristmovements and individuals hidden inside caves  and houses.  Where is thetechnology for a big aircraft like Boeing 777.</p>
<p>Hope all are safe somewhere.</p>
<p>May Almighty find a way to find out this plane soon.</p>
<p>We pray hand in hand to happen God's miracles in human life.  Let Godchange the mindset of the culprits if any involved in this event...</p>
<p>Scientific discovery and human technology will bring the answer in the end</p>
<p>If the plane was hijacked for suicide as it was stated in some of thenews, it likely was taken to the bermuda triangle, the only place onearth where objects (planes, ships) disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>Keep "Handsome Rewards" for people to come forward. Anyrelevant piece of info should be highly rewarded. Somebody out there hassome information definitely. Someone would have had witnessed something.All the passenger's details and past should be investigated especiallyof the 2 Stolen passport passengers. There will be alot of Clues for sure.</p>
<p>Come home @Malaysian Airlines. Come home safe. We are all waiting foryour safe land. Its might now or tomorrow. But we wish you all to comehome soon.</p>
<p>This probably is the first time that a commercial airline afterhijacking has hopefully landed safely, but where? In a few days, we mayget the answer for it.</p>
<p>We pray for all of you... i know that you alwill come back soon. So many are cryingand waiting for you.... plz. Will pray again again and one more again.....all are safe and back soon..... </p>
<p>Provided the transponders turned off, the military of several countriesthrough which the plane might have flewn could have shot down as well.They are going to cover it up for sure. Just my thought.</p>
<p>after 10 days mr PM address to nation shame on him</p>
<p>It is really frustrating. As Syed just mentioned, How in the wide worldcan such a reliable and efficient aircraft just disappear? It'simpossible that the aircraft could have experienced a major technicalfailure. Boeing's aircrafts and in particular the 777s are very veryefficient. It couldn't have blown out in the sky. If it did, thesearchers might have found some trace of it somewhere. If it ishijacked, how far can you go with limited fuel??? All this is reallyreally confusing. After all if it was hijacked, some radar somewheremight have picked it up, but none did. The aircraft is definitely not inwater, if it was, those phones would not have been ringing. So the onlything left to say is that it is on land somewhere. And it is very likelythat it is on some island. If it was anywhere else, someone might havespotted it and informed the authorities, but no one did.....</p>
<p>God is great! MH370 will be back soon with all the 239 passengersonboard! Hope for the best!</p>
<p>A newscast said the fuel is enough for another 500 miles, so why dontthey survery the area within a radius of 500 males towards the west andupto the Andaman and Nicobar islands.  I hope there will be a major cluetowards the Andaman Islands and Port Blair.</p>
<p>This has been my suspicion from the moment it stuck me that the aircrafthad suddenly changed directions and flew at low altitude.  I had earliercommented that the fictitious Hijack of Flight 714 in Tintin comic is sosimilar.   In the comic 'Flight 714", a temporary runway made ofpieces of rubber sheets anchored on to the beach was used. Once theFlight landed, the rubber sheets were removed and the aircraft was towednear to the jungle/greenery &amp; covered in camouflage to avoiddetection.  The best place to look for would be uninhabited islands orless inhabited islands with long beaches. Andaman &amp; Nicobar islandswould be a great place to land &amp; hide a aircraft. There are around 9uninhabited islands and almost 12 islands with populations lower than20. These islands are known for their long beaches.  think!</p>
<p>It is a mystery, may be there is a blind spot where no one is focusing.If the aircraft is hijacked, the plane should land in a radius of lessthan 2500miles without refueling because that is the fuel it containedto travel 2500miles. if it crashed, the wreckage should have been foundwhile the search is on for the 7th day. If it was in air for a longperiod after disappearing from radar screens, the signals should havebeen picked up by any of the military or civilian radars. IT IS AMYSTERY, HOW SOMEONE COULD MAKE THE AIRCRAFT VANISH FROM RADARS, EARTH,SKY AND SEAS. Can anyone imagine, one day this aircraft MH370 returningto airport in Malaysia in one piece and all passengers aboard SAFE??</p>
<p>We have faith in God and He can still do wonders. Hope to see all thepassengers alive</p>

<p>God help them. I am boarding a 777 now and I hope its safe. Maybe we candrop some McDonalds around the Andaman islands and if there aresurvivors they can have it. B777 reserved.</p>
<p>Its very sad and at the same time surprising and funny that none ofmilitary radars of any country captured and unindentified aircraftflying over its airspace and waters. Come on and give me a break.</p>
<p>Ayyo! Firstly may God protect them and unite them with their loved ones.It's such a terrible news.  @sulaiman what kind of insensitive personwrites such comments. This is a very sad moment for mankind. What ifthey dont like McDonalds? I pray that no one faces such event. Worst ofall fastfood is very unhealthy.</p>
<p>Apart from all the conspiracy theories, the most ridiculous is that thePlane is hidden somewhere in Pakistan, well never know if later Americahas to do a stealth operation to recover that plane from some of the suburbs......</p>
<p>Is it a surprise to all that MH370 disappeared without any trace? Thenwhat about 911 incident, where did the million tons steels and cementsdisappear in few minutes???  Where did the water tanks which run inmillions of gallons disappear???</p>
<p>What a joke!!!!  My prayers are with the passengers &amp; their familiesback home. But to be honest i feel the plan has crashed somwhere deepinto the sea or somewhere on the unmanned islands..no one an wait till 9days for ransome demand..i dont think any one is so generous to providefood to 239 people, or to keep a boeing 777 as a pet.. Missing of thisplane is a shame for so called advanced world &amp; theirtechnologies..once again blame culture is in the air..they can blame anyone for their failures. Where are the technologyexperts?????????????????????????????????????</p>
<p>I think something going wrong because since the flight dissappre firstmalaysia goverment said it can  be crashd and now the are saying itsgone somewhere.why they did not check the settelite signals on same day...... i think malaysia goverment involed in this full drama....  BY theway hows plane can go to pakistan if there is no pakistani....also thereare few airports where he can land..... The story gone from malaysia topakistan. i have to remind them who says that the plane went to pakistanthat we have strong relatioship with china like brothers . if malaysiacan not find the plane then they should hire like FBI,ISI and RAW. i amsure they will get result within one week. tnx</p>
<p> Kudos to Gulf News! What a dsitressing headline. Media was speculatingon a lot of options. There's no significant speculation in mainstream"media" worldwide that said that Pakistan might be responsiblefor this disappearance. And lo and behold Gulf News in its gray style ofjournalism smears Pakistan's image again. How about 200 headlines on themainpage, each stating a name of a random country name and then sayingthat it is not a suspect. Gray journalism at its best. For God's sakeGulf News! stop giving negative press to Pakistan in your main headlineswhen there is very very little backing or significance to that report.</p>
<p>I don't think this was flown over Paksitan or anywhere else to theNorth. Even if transponder is deactivated, it can still be detected onradar but no identification, it will show as unamed/unsignatured dot onthe radar screen. The military radars from the countries where it flewwill be able track it and for sure those countries and would have beenallerted and scrambled their fighter-interceptor jets if a suspiciousun-identified aircraft is flying over their territory. As my personalopinion, I'm smelling a conspiracy or  the  Malaysian government is nottelling the truth to the public. I hope all passengers will be safe.</p>
<p>We earthlings are not alone!</p>
<p> To T Siddiqui, you said you are 100% sure that this was shot down byAmerican. It seemed that you are involved on it because you are verysure on your statement. Why dont you help those investigator to shine alight? Or better investigator/INTERPOL  should track you for yourinvolvement and knowledge on this? Such a comment no brainer comment.</p>
<p>Sad that plane is still traced out, and the life of manypassenger is on risk; I pray to Almighty Allah for the safety ofpassenger....</p>
<p>There were more than 200 passengers on board. This is so tragic and sadsituation where we are relying on incomplete technical records to cometo a logical conclusion. Why are we looking to options of hijacking orcrew background checking? Why are we not looking to the straight forwardoption of technical failure wherein Pilot would have been so helplessand clueless and with tremendous pressure to save passengers lives. Itmight be a case of short circuit where Pilot would have deliberatelyunplugged the electrical components to save the aircraft from any sourceof fire. Also finding that he is lost his track path , he would haveturned the aircraft back to seek Malaysian ATC help by any availablefrequency range to communicate. Seemingly to have lost navigationalwaypoints and thus all  hope of safely landing , he would have decidedto consume all fuel before deliberate crashing so as to avoid any fire.He would have exhausted fuel before reaching safe island and must havecrashed in Indian ocean or forested Andaman island. This might be apossibility considering the credulous professional career of the pilotand crews. Why are we not thinking on this line?</p>
<p>The entire investigation by the Malaysian authorities is a sham. Tobegin with the PM gives a press conference after 8 days, an honourableminister is not able to differentiate between races, their radarmisfires and the plane seemingly heads to the west (MalaccaStraits)...and all search and rescue initially by 12 countries areInterestingly conducted (as instructed by the ministry) in the east(South China Sea)???!!! With no debris being spotted, initially theauthorities were focused on passengers travelling on stolen passports,they are not even aware how much aviation fuel was loaded, so manyunanswered questions and Malaysia is wooing tourists ??? Claiming thecountry to be truly Asia?. The govt authorities had enough time toconduct background checks beginning with the Captain/co-pilot/cabincrew. Why the same were not conducted from the very 1st / 2nd day? Eventhe co-pilot  Fariq Abdulla who entertained two women in the cockpit in2011 from take-off to landing, has not been investigated till date.Thorough investigation about the captain and co-pilot background checkspre-flight need to be shared with the next of kin / media so as not tospeculate. Now the blame game has shifted to passengers and claims madethat certain countries are avoiding sharing information about theircitizens. Time to stop blaming advanced technology and own up to theirfolly. The Malaysian authorities need to put their heads together andsort out their differences. Imagine this is the biggest task undertakenin aviation history involving 25 nations, 43 ships and 58 aircraftssearching for an advanced, highly sophisticated and safest commercialaircraft B 777 operating for the past 18 years worldwide and the endresult….as claimed by the Transport/Defence Minister... simplyVanished!!! with no clue !!??. The crime is in their own backyard tillsuch time the authorities come clean about the cabin crew and thoroughinvestigation at ground level. Even their military radar were not ableto notify their personnel for a stray aircraft overflying Malaysianairspace ??? This calls for a Hollywood thriller.</p>
<p>If the aircraft was flown to Pakistan, then it would naturally fly overIndia. Any aircraft that has to fly over Indian Airspace or particularlyany country's airspace has to notify the nearest ATC of that country.India didn't receive any such notification from any unknown aircraft.Secondly, the aircraft doesn't have that much fuel to make trip toPakistan without crossing over India.  So, think again beforemaking assumptions.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone monitoring the radar systems was paid tolook the other way when the plane flew back over the country..... Also,why no word on whether authorities are checking the cell phone recordsof the passengers? Surely someone sent a text or made a cell phone callif they thought the plane was in distress. If no one did, then it mustbe foul play.</p>
<p>where r we in this world? They make movies showing tech that no humancan imagine and on the other side can't locate a plane. Kudos to peoplewho blame Pakistan for everything!! People who blame others  are on a searchmission of a black sheep to sacrifice on their behalf...</p>
<p>I think world should be more technologically advanced and hence need todivert all the funds meant for Mars and other bodies.  Make our worldsafe and try to reach Mars.  How come the earth is not your hand and youare trying to control Mars.... Hope a clear message to our scientist.</p>
<p>Just heard an expert comment on CNN, saying accident history shows many,many passenger jet pilots don't have the necessary skills to control andfly the big aircraft when the automatic flight equipment fails and theyhave to revert to manual flying. Now that's really scary for the flyingpublic -- pilots who don't actually know how to fly and control theaircraft they are supposedly in charge of.</p>
<p>Nobody is talking because they are not able to verify what have alwaysbeen considered the most likely choices.  It is time to consider thepossibility that someone  actually hacked the autopilot to take over theplane.  This was done twice to US Drones.  </p>
<p>In this day of technology where apparently NSA known what we ate fordinner as Mr. Snowden claims, we can not find 200 feet long airliner israther unbelievable............</p>
<p>Taxis in Abudhabi, Dubai and Sharjah Emirates have GPS . This helps theauthorities to track down a car even if it's parked deep in the desert.GPS system is implemented in Dubai school buses also. Strange that anaircraft cannot be tracked because its communication devices was shut.Is it such n easy job. There is foul play in this. The pilots can be theculprits. Suppose someone had instructed them at gun point, theywould've somehow alerted the danger. Here it's all planned.</p>
<p>Why are these tracking devices made so they can be disabled?  Ought tobe a GPS  or some other device that cannot be touched or changed.</p>
<p>We don't need anyadditional half baked conspiracy theories, thanks!  The pilot knew whathe was doing. he reversed course and stayed on the path of commercialtravel, so no one would notice the aircraft's position as being unusual.Why? I don't know, but I am not going to blame someone either. Let'swait and see what we discover, and MAYBE these people are alivesomewhere? My thoughts are with the families.</p>
<p>Remember, just because something is not made public can very well beestablished knowledge.. Then, unfortunately there are too many weirdcoincidences here, from the pilot's perhaps over-enthusiast backgroundall the way to multinational military operation Cobra Gold -that hastaken place near enough not too long ago- via the 20 employees ofFreescale Semiconductor on this flight (it's high profile in relatedfield of expertise could be relevant in this case), and those 5 who inthe end did not board the flight though checked in, to allow forspeculation. Such a pilot is an easy target to blame for sophisticatedmaneuvers, but why someone of his caliber would want to damage hisprofessional legacy? And passengers can somehow just miss their flightseven form the terminal.. and important engineers flown in a whole groupas they were not suspecting anything wrong.. and maybe indeed there wasno higher-than-average military coverage in the region as they allquickly dispersed after the exercise.. Then again, common people wouldand will not know all the facts and whether they are of relevance. Evenless of what technology is REALLY capable of, be it mobile phones (toonaive to expect they'd work in the middle of nowhere) or satellites butespecially top-secret military gadgets. Forget stationary radars, thereis more to near-Earth surveillance, AWACS -Boeing E-3 Sentry is commonknowledge but there can be others and surely such info is not ourbusiness. To expect to be told of the whole picture in every detail is achildhood fantasy. Just feeling sorry for all the innocent peopleinvolved, and their loved ones who cannot have a closure. And yetbelieving it must have been a far less malicious event -if not innocent-than what it's starting to be painted as..</p>
<p>I say is it got sucked in by the alien mother ship which took off fromwater just when the flight 370 was above it and it has already beentransported to their world. The pings detected by the satellite waswhile the plane was still in the mother ship the reason why the pingsmovements can't be explained. The plane is definitely not on this planetand of course investigators will  say that anyway.</p>
<p>I think something going wrong because since the flight disappear firstMalaysia government said it can be crashed &amp; now the are saying itsgone somewhere. Why they did not check the satellite signals on same day&amp;  it really hard to believe Malaysia airlines not noticed by anymilitary radars . USA Will utilize this opportunity..., MayGod Almighty find  a way to find this plane soon</p>
<p>I am wondering if there are enough satellite pictures of the area toplay back from the plane's last "known location" that can thenverify through various numbers of satellites taking pictures atdifferent times, which can then track all the movements of the jet fromthe last location on to wherever the jet wound up.    Surely there areenough satellites in the sky and taking so many pictures, there is a wayto draw a line, even separating other jets</p>
<p>If this is a hostile takeover or takeover by the pilots as part of aplot, then what country in it's right mind would give out all theinformation? Every intelligence and military resource available aroundthe world would be working to locate the plane and the perpetrators, andbring the incident to a conclusion with the least loss of life. PsyOps,NSAs and BlackOps, every anachronism out there would be working aroundthe clock, so expect to be kept in the dark and fed misinformation. Thenwait 30-40 years to hear the whole story of how it happened and how itwas resolved, if it is.</p>
<p>"Last communication came after shutdown began "  This says itwas definitely the pilot who communicated last since the shutoff is inthe cockpit.  It also proves the plane wasn't shut down.  The pilot Shahseemed a bit off - obsessive, etc - very sure he did this because Anwargoing to jail for 5 years earlier in the day...</p>
<p>May Allah protect and return all passenger safe and sound. How wrong ofpeople mentioning pakistan.</p>
<p>This is really horrable situation for all mankind, being in the mostadvance technology era if we dont able find missing huge aircraftm itsounds abnormal, either the authorities became irresposible or they aremaking fool of people, something went wrong and they want to hide them,come on man give a break continuesly giving all unrelated information,its not a girls small pendant or hearing which is lost somewhere and youpeople are searching its a huge aircraft with 239 people life involved,praying god to save them and their  livehood, all techonolgies advancereseaerched, projects all nothing they simply play with mankind, godplease help us and please dont blame other nation that hide aircraft,its you inefficeincy</p>
<p>It’s a shame that mediaor any of the countries can’t find a missing plane in a high techworld of today. Blame anybody at random is equally shameful. Stopblaming; find the plane for heaven sake. I hope all are alive, Godforbids if not let the relatives know. It’s so hard for thosefamilies to know nothing. It’s a sad joke.</p>
<p>I think they should verify is the final words of the pilot are that ofthe pilot himself or someone else!! might be someone else flying theaircraft by that time!!!  Possibility of a hijacking is less because nomobile signals have been picked up from any of the passengers mobiles!!</p>
<p>I thinks getting normal routine that what ever wrong happens in any partof the world, just blame it on Pakistan without any credible proof, 1thing is for sure Gulf news is losing its credibility, always defamingPakistan without getting the whole story.</p>
<p>my paryer for those missing passengers. i think we are leaving some mainpoints here and picking unnecessary stuffs. Malaysia Govt. pls stop thisdrama and biring the truth. You have technology utilize it or else saythe truth that you are hiding for the shake of those 239 souls.</p>
<p>Dear all 'genius' commenters. I am Malaysian and I am appalled by theway you evaluating the situation and condemning my country. If your catwent missing you would search the area you believe you lost it. At themean time you are investigating all the possibilities why she is lost.You realized your cat went somewhere based on little evidence/ tracesyou find. You believed she went to your neighbour's house. You have toknock the door and ask for information. If your neighbour give littleinformation, you take it and have to expand your search. You also can'truled out possibility that your cat could be abducted. If this kind ofcommon sense you can't digest, you should check your brain and nottelling my people to do that. And one more thing, try to differentiateofficial press release by government and media speculations.. they alldifferent!</p>
<p>I have been watching television this evening, trying to understand thedisappearance of the plane and the possible loss of all the people onboard. Several people who commented here found hope in the fact thatpassengers'  cell phones still ring. Sadly, one of the guest experts a news channel said that cell phones will continue to ringwhether or not the phone is operational.</p>
<p>Malaysian Government is definitely hiding a lot of facts here and maybeto cover up their act the poor pilots are being cornered.  Come out withthe truth Malaysia, you cant hide facts forever. You are playing withhuman lives here.  I hope the 239 lives onboard are safe....</p>
<p>Thats where people have to realize that whatever is not known to humans,Allah knows that... Allah has given its mankind lot of power and toolsto conquer this world but again we have to realize that only Allah knowsthe knowledge of the dark and the unknown. My request to all people isto pray to Allah to guide us and provide us the knowledge to knowreality of what actually had happened to MH370.</p>
<p>After the disappearance of the French airliner a few years ago, if ithad been mandatory for all airlines to subscribe to satellite servicenetworks, we would not be facing this ridiculous situation where aman-made object with 239 people aboard vanishes without a trace.   Aspassengers are we expected to also find out such details before trustingour loved ones or our lives in their care? The incident throws light onglaring discrepancies which should be addressed immediately.</p>
<p>Would like to know what was the exchange with Air traffic control thatlead up to the last transmission of " Alright good night" DidATC hand off to Vietnam ATC? Did Vietnam ATC speak with the crew?</p>
<p>I think the Malaysian Air Force is the most suspicious.  We have beenhearing nothing but lies from the Malaysian government.  I think itmight have been an attempted attack like 9-11 but the plane was shotdown by the Malaysian Air Force.  To avoid international criticism, theMalaysian government has been using one lie to cover another.  Just waitand see!  What a sad incident indeed.</p>
<p>I think this is the biggest joke we have had in the 21st century. Howdoes an airline disappear mysteriously and its over a week now and allwe are hearing is lies? This is reprehensible</p>
<p>To Malaysia Authority .  Have they check with Indonesia Aceh for furtherinvestigate??.  One of aceh fisherman saw the white plane turn aroundthe area very low and suddenly disappear.  He reported this incident toIndonesia TV news that the plane wind also caught fire.   I watch thisTV news from sallelite Indonesia today. 17.03.14</p>
<p>What is interesting to me, as a pilot, is that whoever said"alright good night" certainly did not use standard pilotlingo. I assume that this was in response to a hand off from MalaysianATC to Vietnamese ATC. A standard response would go similar to asfollows "Kuala Lumpur Center, Roger Maylaysia 370 going to SaigonCenter on 128.6 Good Day" or some such thing. In other words, thepilot always repeats what has been transmitted to him, identifieshimself by callsign, and repeats the next frequency assigned. Could itbe that the person who said this was under duress, or not familiar withATC lingo?</p>
<p>Why they still not found the ringing telephone gps which area locatedthis tower..</p>
<p>Its High time people stop blaming one another and rather look forreasons. For the acclaimed intellectuals  who feel they have knownall the mysteries of the world, this incident is an eye opener to seehow inadequate can technology be with all the support of :- find mygadgets, radar transmission, and satellite photographs that include picstaken every nano second....and yet no trace of the flight.  may be wehaven't thought of some force of nature which we have never actuallyencountered with so are walking clueless looking at only known facts.</p>
<p>If mobile phones/simcards could be used in coordiantin with personaldata given to airlines and countries telecomminication system to tracethe location</p>
<p>I hope there was some suspicious persons or information board on thatplane and Malaysian Govt, callback the plane and it is under custody ofMalaysian air force. (in the first news the plane was u turned toMalaysia, the transponders are kept off by the instruction of air force.the plane must be under custody of Malaysian Air force.</p>
<p>Is there any chance this plane could go to space? If it not in ground orsea, i think the next step should be searching in the SPACE!</p>
<p>Interested criticizers might lend a helping hand instead of  jibberjabber.It will mean alot. Gulfnews broadcasts factualinformation,nothing personal.Gulfews did not provoke anything when it comes to Pakistan.Lets us raise or hold handstogether for  MH370 ,the crew and family members going through toughtime.Blaming game wont help here,Let authorized people do theirqualified for duty and in the mean time we pray.</p>
<p>We all should avoid slandering the deceased when there is no concreteevidence. The argument that the transponder will never stop functioningis very hard to believe. There are cases in Air India Dreamlineraircrafts, transponder stopped functioning on route to Chicago fromDelhi, and the pilot returned to Delhi when it was over Afganistan.</p>
<p>I don't know how it may sound but why don't authorities use metaldetectors or aluminium detectors used in aircraft to locate the plane injungles,bushes,Islands, etc.Plane might have crashed or something orlanded in remote or abandoned airports.Apart from top secrets Who kowswhat might have happened.</p>
<p>Really this is pathetic, we are in 21st Century with advancedTechnology. Simple and sure Malaysian Government is playing with 239Souls. Past 9 Days still lagging to find missing plane even 22 Countriesare involved for searching it.</p>
<p>A Greek Petrochemical Barge has found some debris along the Straights orMallacca, it was said in some newspapers.  How far is that true.  Havethey MAS authorities really gone to that area for survey.</p>
<p>Since there is no proof available of the disappearance of flight, aswell more than 29 countries were searching and was not successful, whichis a fact no body can deny it. Best option is to give some space toMalaysian Offices to work out the location of flight. Rising and blamingMalaysian is an act of Coward.</p>
<p>I think from now on we all have to take our own Personal Locator Beaconswith us while travelling in airlines.  This incident is really a goodchallange for the Aviation Authorities and the Aircraft manufacturers inthis 21st century. I believe a new type of Aircraft Position LocatingEquipment with advanced technology is going to come in the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Malaysia could have been more transparent when their Military radars hadtracked the flight movement. As this information was not shared themassive search operation had turned out to be a farce. A wasted effort.</p>
<p>When you buy a Smartphone for $500, you have the capability ofdownloading some software which will help you track the phone if it getsstolen. And all this on a phone that costs only a few hundred dollars.However, we now have an airline that most probably cost around $100million dollars and no one can find it. That is amazing!!</p>
<p>The technology invented by HUMAN is not able to search the inventedtechnology.  The world do  not believe in  Unidentified FlyingObjects(UFO's) as there are no clear evidence behind it. I suspect thisincident could be related to Alien Abduction.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the plane was taken by Aliens. No onewants to admit it.</p>
<p>This is really strange, In this world have great great technologies,Definitely there is high potential to find out this. I feel that stephas taken is not effective on search of this plane. If still officialcannot find, might aliens have taken this plane into their world.</p>
<p>The manner the Malaysian govt has handled the unfortunate disappearanceof a sophisticated airliner is a mystery. To the extent, even themanufacturers have given less / no information to assist. Now we have 25countries involved? It is not about the number game but, transparencywith partners involved in the search and rescue rather than being adoubting Thomas !!! From the very beginning they were clueless and stillremain!!?? The authorities need to play their cards well and give therespective countries access to information they need to speed up thesearch and bring relief to the tormented families. Adding additionalcountries, planes and ships brings no solace to the mess the authoritieshave created over the past 10 days and still counting. If the need ofthe hour is transparency, then yes, a quick and thorough investigationshould be conducted on the MH 370 Captain and Co-Pilot / ground crew andfindings to be made known to the next of kin and the world at large.This is the worst case scenario of its kind for a sophisticatedcommercial airline’s history disappearance globally.  Malaysia isa well-developed country with a pool of talented / skilled individualsfrom China and India who are the minority or non-Malays. Are they beingsuppressed from the mainstream of politics and, individual developmenthampered, cause, being a non-malay? Assuming this too has added to thefury, vented out by people across the globe on the Malaysian Govt Auth.in handling of the situation and its minorities. Families of thepassengers of MH370 need answers and now, before it’s too late !!!</p>
<p>THERES MUST BE A CATCH IN THIS... </p>
<p>I've watched in Discovery, animals and Fish are getting tagged byscientists with devices which will enable to track and pin point thesubject anywhere in deep ocean. Why on earth these Air craft's whichcarry precious human life have any device which will help to pin pointits stationed location in case of catastrophe as such. Are we still instone age??</p>
<p>Instead of tracing the location of the aircraft, families should starttracing the location of passenger's phone. TELECOM &amp; MOBILEcompanies can help in the search for mobile phone location while it isstill switch on which can be traced to its location.</p>
