<p>The March 31 deadline for signing up for health care coverage under the Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Act is fast approaching.<br/>
Michiganders can enroll through the federal marketplace at <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov" target="_new">http://www.healthcare.gov</a> Despite earlier glitches, the website is now up and running well.<br/>
Find a local Navigator who can help guide consumers through the enrollment process at <a href="http://www.enrollMichigan.com" target="_new">http://www.enrollMichigan.com</a><br/>
Those who have questions about how health insurance works, or how to price options that fit into the household budget, the Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service offers “Smart Choices for Health Insurance Coverage” webinars and workshops.

Consumers who are required to enroll but don’t by the deadline will face a financial penalty of $95 for the 2014 tax year. The penalty rises sharply in future years for those who continue to fail to sign up.<br/>
The Health Insurance Marketplace will make it easier to shop for health plans in Michigan. All plans will be listed in one place, so consumers can make apples-to-apples comparisons of the benefits and prices. And all plans are required to describe what’s included in simple language, so there’s no guesswork about what’s covered.<br/>
The health insurance plans must cover the essentials. All plans offered on the Marketplace are required to cover important benefits, like doctor visits, emergency care, prescriptions, preventive care and more.<br/>
For the first time, there’s financial help to pay for health insurance. Now, health coverage is finally within reach for millions of Americans. In fact, many people who buy their plan on the Marketplace can get help covering the costs. And low-cost or free plans are available depending on your income.</p>

<p>If Alexander Weyer had to put a postmark on when he decided to build a tiny home, he’d guess it started about three years ago just as most of his thoughts begin: under the stars.
Weyer, an openly gay practicing astrologer and herbalist, was visiting a friend one night in Detroit, thinking about life’s grand design and how freeing it would be to downsize. </p>
