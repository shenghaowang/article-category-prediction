<p>EBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.</p>
<p>The San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn’s proposed two board nominees. Icahn, who holds a 2.2 percent stake in eBay, wants the company to spin off PayPal, its electronic payments division. He wanted two of his employees on the eBay board to promote that agenda.</p>
<p>“Neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise,” said Richard Schlosberg, chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee.</p>
<p>Instead, eBay backs the re-election of four existing board members: President and CEO John Donahoe; Fred Anderson, co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners; Edward Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent Technologies; and Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Talking smack, the company and the pugnacious billionaire issued dueling press releases notable for their frankness.</span></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.shareholderssquaretable.com/we-believe-based-on-evidence-we-have-newly-uncovered-that-donahoes-inexcusable-incompetence-cost-ebay-stockholders-over-4-billion/">a lengthy screed</a> on his website, ShareholdersSquareTable, Icahn accused eBay CEO John Donohoe of “inexcusable incompetence (that) cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion” for selling Skype too soon and too cheaply. He also attacked eBay board member Marc Andreessen, whose investor group bought Skype and then flipped it to Microsoft at a $4 billion premium. Previously, he’d also taken aim at Intuit’s Cook,</p>
<p>Under eBay’s tender ministrations, PayPal may “wither,” Icahn wrote. “ I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL ,” he wrote.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For its part, </span><a href="http://www.ebayinc.com/in_the_news/story/ebay-inc-responds-carl-icahn%E2%80%99s-feb-24-open-letter-stockholders" style="line-height:1.5em;">Ebay said Icahn is dabbling in “false and misleading” statements</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,” it said, referring to Andreessen and Cook. “And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.” </span></p>
<p>Icahn’s 2.2 percent eBay stake isn’t actually enough for him to actually wrest much control. So what’s his real agenda?</p>
<p>As Icahn biographer Mark Stevens last week <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Icahn-s-rebrand-from-devil-to-angel-looks-5291968.php">told Chronicle business editor and columnist Tom Lee</a>: ”It’s all a game to him. He’s a master chess player. The only person who knows what Carl Icahn really wants is Carl Icahn.”</p>
