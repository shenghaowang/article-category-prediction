<p>Mortgage rate trends are inherently unpredictable — right up there with economic recessions and stock prices.</p>
<p>But even non-experts could do a pretty good job guessing where <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/">mortgage rates</a> will go for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>With a hot economy, an active Federal Reserve, and inflation starting to tick up, mortgage rates would have a really hard time going down.</p>
<p>The best we can hope for is that they stay where they are long enough for homebuyers and refinance candidates to <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/30820/lock-mortgage-rate">lock in</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, 30-year fixed rates are still in the 4s. This was considered an impossible range just a few years ago. Despite incessant rate increases, these rates are somehow still available.</p>
<p>Don’t want a rate over 5%? Now could be the time to act.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of market-moving news in October. Developments now will impact your ability to buy or refinance this month and in the remainder of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Mortgage Rate Forecast 2018" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43157" height="" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src="https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post.jpg" srcset="https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post.jpg 800w, https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post-300x169.jpg 300w, https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post-768x432.jpg 768w, https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post-500x281.jpg 500w, https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post-250x141.jpg 250w, https://assets.themortgagereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mortgage-Rate-Forecast-Post-320x180.jpg 320w" width="100%"/></p>
<p>Rate forecasts at the beginning of the year have pretty much come true. Most major housing and financial authorities predicted rates somewhere between 4.7% and 5.0% for 2018.</p>
<p>According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed rate for an ideal candidate jumped to 4.72% at the end of September. That’s very close to the rough 4.75% rate you get when you average predictions from seven agencies like Realtor.com and the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p>The good news is that we are not very likely to see any more huge jumps for the remainder of the year if forecasts are accurate.</p>
<p>But, we are very likely to see a gradual increase until January 2019, starting the year in the high 4s.</p>
<p>Been looking for a good rate on a refinance or home purchase? Now might be the time to lock.</p>
<p>A hot economy is an enemy to low rates, and there’s little doubt we’re in a hot economy.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is at 3.9%, considered very low. <strong>There is now less than one unemployed worker for every available job</strong>. Yep, there are now more jobs than workers to fill them.</p>
<p>Compare that with 2009, when there were <strong>more than 6 unemployed workers for every available job</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s a “workers market,” and that’s good for people in general, because — just taking a wild guess here — most of us would rather have income than an ultra-low mortgage rate.</p>
<p>But it’s not so good for those looking to buy or refinance.</p>
<p>Inflation is bad for mortgage rates. The simple equation emerges: hot economy = inflation = higher mortgage rates</p>
<p>This worker shortage will eventually lead to inflation as companies pay more to hire and retain workers. These firms then pass on those costs via higher priced products.</p>
<p>Higher prices for goods and services is the very definition of inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is bad for mortgage rates. The simple equation emerges:</p>
<p><em>Hot economy = inflation = higher mortgage rates</em></p>
<p>So what’s a home mortgage shopper to do? Simply lock in as soon as you can. We won’t be getting off this economic tour de force for a while.</p>
<p>The most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (aka “The Fed”) just ended September 26. As everyone expected, the group hiked its benchmark federal funds rate.</p>
<p>While the action <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/17724/how-mortgage-rates-move-when-the-federal-reserve-meets">didn’t directly affect mortgage rates</a>, it did lend to an overall environment of rising rates, which certainly doesn’t help the mortgage rate shopper.</p>
<p>And, expect another rate hike in December. Twelve of the 16 Fed meeting participants predict one more hike in 2018. That would make a total of four rate increases this year.</p>

<p>Those who are waiting for rates to go down may be sadly disappointed in 2018.</p>
<p>However, for those who are willing to wait a bit, many experts are predicting a recession in 2020. Half the economists surveyed in a recent poll by the National Association of Business Economics indicate an oncoming recession.</p>
<p>An economic pull-back could prompt the Fed to lower the fed funds rate. The Fed could even make mortgage rates artificially low like it did in the wake of the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p>(Many economists believe that the Fed is hiking rates now partially because it needs to cut them if the economy turns south.)</p>
<p>For homeowners who just want to refinance, a 2020 rate drop might be worth waiting for. But for a homebuyer, it could backfire. Home prices could be 10 to 20 percent higher by then, negating any rate savings.</p>
<p>Think you’ll be buying in the next couple of years? Today’s rates may be the best we see.</p>
<p>Mortgage rates have already surpassed predictions cast by major housing agencies. Now, the question is, what are these groups forecasting for the remainder of the year?</p>
<p>To sum it up, everyone is predicting higher rates. Today’s rate might be as good as we’ll see for years to come.</p>
<p>Knowing what will happen in October is only half the battle. As a mortgage rate shopper, now you need to know the best actions to take this month.</p>
<p>Homeowners have racked up a monumental amount of home equity in recent years. According to statistics site Statista, U.S. homeowners are sitting on more than $14 trillion in equity.</p>
<p>But they are struggling with <em>how</em> to tap into that equity.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/24853/cash-out-refinance-vs-home-equity-loan">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a> is fast, convenient, and comes with low closing costs. Most importantly, you don’t have to touch your first mortgage to get one.</p>
<p>A cash-out refinance, though, replaces your first mortgage and gives you cash back for the new loan amount that exceeds your old one. That gives you a potentially higher rate, plus additional closing costs.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/18286/cash-out-refinance-mortgage-freddie-mac">cash-out refi</a> limits your exposure to a Federal Reserve that is determined to raise rates. Home equity rates are adjustable and rise every time the Fed hikes rates. A 30-year fixed cash-out loan payment never changes.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where a homeowner needs $50,000 cash. Shortly after taking the HELOC, the Fed hikes rates to 2007 levels.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, HELOCs eventually turn into “fully amortizing” loans. When they begin, they often require that only interest is paid.</p>
<p>The principal-plus-interest payment at 9% gets pretty steep.</p>
<p>But with a cash-out loan, you avoid that risk. You lock in at a certain rate and stay there as long as you keep the loan.</p>
<p>So, a HELOC may not be the best home equity tool, after all.</p>
<p>Many mortgage shoppers don’t realize there are many different types of mortgage rates. But this knowledge can help home buyers and refinancing households find the best value for their situation.</p>
<p>Following are updates for specific loan types and their corresponding rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://themortgagereports.com/25098/conventional-refinance-rates-guidelines">Conventional refinance rates</a> and those for home purchases are still low despite recent increases.</p>
<p>According to loan software company Ellie Mae, the 30-year mortgage rate averaged 4.94% in August, the most recent data available.</p>
<p>This is slightly higher than Freddie Mac’s 4.72% average because it factors in low credit and <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/11306/buy-a-home-with-a-low-downpayment-or-no-downpayment-at-all">low-down-payment</a> conventional loan closings, which tend to come with higher rates.</p>
<p>Lower credit score borrowers can use conventional loans, but these loans are more suited for those with decent credit and at least 3% down. Five percent down is preferable due to higher rates that come with lower down payments.</p>
<p>Twenty percent of equity is preferred when refinancing.</p>
<p>With adequate equity in the home, a conventional refinance can pay off <em>any</em> loan type. Got an Alt-A, subprime, or high-PMI loan? A <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/25098/conventional-refinance-rates-guidelines">conventional refi</a> can take care of it.</p>
<p>For instance, say you purchased a home three years ago with an <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/17567/fha-mortgage-rates-federal-housing-administration-assumable-203k-mip">FHA loan</a> at 3.5% down. Since then, home values have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>You refinance into a conventional loan (because you now have 20% equity) and <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/7570/fha-mip-cancel">eliminate FHA mortgage insurance.</a></p>
<p>This could be a savings of hundreds of dollars per month, <strong><em>even if your interest rate goes up</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Getting rid of mortgage insurance is a big deal. This <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/mortgage-payment-calculator-pmi-taxes-insurance-hoa-dues" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">mortgage calculator with PMI</a> estimates your current mortgage insurance cost. Enter 20% down to see your new payment without PMI.</p>
<p>FHA is currently the go-to program for home buyers who may not qualify for conventional loans.</p>
<p>The good news is that you will get a similar rate — or even lower one — with an FHA loan than you will with conventional.</p>
<p><em>Related: Read more about FHA costs and requirements on our <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/fha-loan-calculator" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">FHA loan calculator page</a>.</em></p>
<p>According to loan software company Ellie Mae, which processes more than 3 million loans per year, FHA loan rates averaged 4.95% in August, while conventional loans averaged 4.94%.</p>
<p>Another interesting stat from Ellie Mae: About 30% of all FHA loans are issued to applicants with scores below 650.</p>
<p>FHA loans come with mortgage insurance. But overall cost is not much more than for conventional loans.</p>
<p>A little-known program, called the <strong>FHA streamline refinance</strong>, lets you convert your current FHA loan into a new one at a lower rate if rates are now lower.</p>
<p>An FHA streamline requires no W2s, pay stubs, or tax returns. And you don’t need an appraisal, so home value doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Homeowners with a VA loan currently are eligible for the ever-popular <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/10592/va-streamline-refinance">VA streamline refinance</a>.</p>
<p>No income, asset, or appraisal documentation is required.</p>
<p>If you’ve experienced a loss of income or diminished savings, a VA streamline can get you into a lower rate and better financial situation. This is true even when you wouldn’t qualify for a standard refinance.</p>
<p>But don’t overlook the <strong>VA loan for home buying</strong>. It requires <strong>zero down payment</strong>. That means if you have the cash for closing costs, or can get them paid for by the seller, you can buy a home without raising any additional funds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>“Don’t overlook the VA loan for home buying. It requires zero down payment.”</em></strong></p>
<p>VA mortgages are offered by local and national lenders, not by the government directly.</p>
<p>This public-private partnership gives consumers the best of both worlds: strong government backing and the convenience and speed of a private company.</p>
<p>Most lenders will accept scores down to 620, or even lower. Plus, you don’t pay high interest rates for low scores.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/13222/10-biggest-benefits-of-a-va-home-loan">VA loans</a> come with the lowest rates of all loan types according to Ellie Mae. In August, 30-year VA mortgage rates averaged just 4.74% while conventional loans averaged 4.94%</p>

<p>There’s incredible value in VA loans.</p>
<p>Like FHA and VA, current USDA loan holders can refinance via a “streamlined” process.</p>
<p>With the USDA streamline refinance, you don’t need a new appraisal. You don’t even have to qualify using your current income. The lender will only make sure that you are still within USDA income limits.</p>
<p><a href="https://themortgagereports.com/26089/usda-streamline-refinance-program">More about the USDA streamline refinance.</a></p>
<p><strong>Home buyers</strong> are also learning the benefits of the USDA loan program for home buying.</p>
<p><strong>No down payment</strong> is required, and rates are ultra-low.</p>
<p>Home payments can be even lower than rent payments, as this <a href="https://themortgagereports.com/usda-loan-calculator" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">USDA loan calculator</a> shows.</p>
<p>Qualification is easier because the government wants to spur homeownership in rural areas. Home buyers might qualify even if they’ve been turned down for another loan type in the past.</p>
<p>While a monthly mortgage rate forecast is helpful, it’s important to know that rates change daily.</p>
<p>You might get 4.7% today, and 4.8% tomorrow. Many factors alter the direction of current mortgage rates.</p>
