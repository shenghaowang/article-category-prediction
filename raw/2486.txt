<p><strong>NEW YORK (AP) –</strong> American Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. are ending an agreement that allowed travelers to add connections to their itinerary on each other’s aircraft.</p>
<p>The termination of the interline sales agreement is effective Monday.</p>
<p>The companies also said that they are ending a reciprocal frequent flyer program accrual agreement. Travelers won’t earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes run by the other airline beginning April 1.</p>
<p>All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through the partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and are not affected.</p>
<p>Last month Delta announced changes to its frequent flier program. Starting next year, Delta customers will earn miles based on how much they spend, not just miles flown.</p>
<p>American Airlines Group Inc. is the holding company for American Airlines and US Airways.</p>
