<p class="story-body__introduction">Irish fruit firm Fyffes and US rival Chiquita are to merge to create the world's largest banana company, worth about $1bn (£597m).</p>
<p>The new firm, named ChiquitaFyffes, is expected to sell about 160 million boxes of bananas annually, more than any rival.</p>
<p>"This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies," said Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan.</p>
<p>It will be listed in New York. </p>
<p>In the merger, shareholders will receive shares in each firm, with Fyffes shareholders owning about 49.3% of the combined company.</p>
<p>Mr Lonergan said the deal would help it to save costs and expand the areas it served.</p>
<p>The tie-up came as Fyffes revealed that its profit before tax for 2013 rose 9.8% to 28.7m euros (£23.8m).</p>
<p>It said results in its banana division were "broadly satisfactory", although profits in that division were slightly down compared with 2012's strong performance. </p>
<p>It said "significant inflation" in the cost of fruit and the strength of the US dollar against sterling had both hit performance.</p>
<p>The global market is currently controlled by four firms - Chiquita, Dole Food Company, Fresh Del Monte and Fyffes - according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>"The first three [companies] on a global scale are not too far away from each other, whereas Fyffes was a good deal smaller. Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector," said David Holohan, analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to go through this year, but will be subject to review by competition authorities.</p>
<p>However, Mr Holohan said that because the two firms operated mainly in separate North American and European markets, this was unlikely to be a problem. </p>
<p class="top-stories-promo-story__summary ">Protesters calling for a referendum on the final deal have attended a mass rally in central London.</p>
