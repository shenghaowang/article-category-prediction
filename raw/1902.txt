<p>As the search for Malaysia Airlines jetliner enters its ninth day, here is a timeline of its last known moments in local Malaysian time, eight hours ahead of GMT, before it disappeared off the radar on Saturday March 8. </p>
<p><strong>00:41</strong></p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 departs from Kuala Lumpur International Airport and is due to land in Beijing at 06:30am the same day. </p>
<p><strong>01:07</strong></p>
<p>The plane sends its last ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) transmission which delivers engine maintenance data to ground control. </p>
<p><strong>01:19</strong></p>
<p>The co-pilot of the flight says <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-03-17/last-communication-on-flight-mh370-from-co-pilot/" target="_blank"><strong>"All right, good night"</strong></a> in the last words heard from flight MH370. </p>
<p><strong>01:21</strong></p>
<p>The plane drops off air traffic control screens as its transponder is switched off. </p>
<p>The plane failed to check in with Vietnamese aviation authorities as scheduled in Ho Chi Minh City. </p>
<p>Authorities later said they believe someone <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/2014-03-15/mh370-missing-malaysia-plane-deliberately-diverted/" target="_blank"><strong>deliberately turned off</strong></a> the plane's communication systems. </p>
<p><strong>02:15</strong></p>
<p>Malaysian military radar picks up flight MH370 at a point south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca - hundreds of miles west of its last known location.</p>
<p><strong>08:11</strong></p>
<p>Satellite tracking data receives the last signal from the plane. </p>
<p>The final communication placed the plane somewhere in one of two corridors: a northern arc stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern one stretching from Indonesia to the vast southern Indian Ocean.</p>
