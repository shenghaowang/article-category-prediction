<p>Investing.com - Gold prices fell marginally in Asian trade on
Monday, awaiting fresh direction after better than expected U.S.
nonfarm payrolls data last week that pointed to a steady pace of
tapering aggressive monetary easing by the Fed.
<br/>
<br/>

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery traded at $1,334.10 a troy ounce, down
0.31%, after settling last week at $1,338.20, down 1.01%.
<br/>
<br/>

Despite Friday's losses, Comex 
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/gold.aspx">gold prices</a>

ended with a 1.24% weekly gain, or $16.60, thanks to advances made
earlier in the week on the back of heightened tensions between
Russia and the U.S. over Russia's involvement in Ukraine's
political crisis.
<br/>
<br/>

Silver for May delivery traded at $20.773 a troy ounce, down 0.74%,
after settling last week at $20.92.
<br/>
<br/>

Gold and silver prices came under heavy selling pressure after the
Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in
February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.
<br/>
<br/>

The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as
more people joined the workforce.
<br/>
<br/>

The upbeat jobs report indicated that the Fed is likely to continue
to scale back its stimulus program, which has burnished the appeal
of the precious metal in recent years.
<br/>
<br/>

In the week ahead, investors will be anticipating what will be
closely-watched data on retail sales and consumer sentiment for
further indications of the strength of the economy and the future
course of monetary policy.
<br/>
<br/>

Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released
Friday showed that hedge funds and money managers increased their
bullish bets in gold futures in the week ending March 4.
<br/>
<br/>

Copper for May delivery was down 1.24% at $3.045 a pound.
<br/>
<br/>

Comex 
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/copper.aspx">copper
prices</a>

lost 3.29% on the week as concerns over Chinese bond defaults
underlined worries over the health of the Asian nation's economy.
<br/>
<br/>

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing
expectations for a 6.8% increase. Imports rose 10.1%, compared to
forecasts for an 8% increase.
<br/>
<br/>

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February.
<br/>
<br/>

A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China
rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations,
while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts
for a 1.9% drop.
<br/>
<br/>

The downbeat data highlighted concerns about slowing growth in the
world's biggest consumer of the industrial metal.</p>
