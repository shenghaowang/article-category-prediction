<p>KUALA LUMPUR, March 16, 2014 (Xinhua) -- </p>
<p>The search operation has entered a new phase and the search area has 
		been significantly expanded, now involving 25 countries, Malaysian 
		Acting Transportation Miniser Hishammuddin Hussein said Sunday at a 
		press conference.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin Hussein said the search now focused both on shallow sea 
		and "large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and 
		remote oceans."</p>
<p>The number of countrires involved in the search has increased to 25 
		from 14, the minister said.</p>
<p>As to information of the two pilots who were suspected by U.S. 
		intelligence analysts of being responsible for the disappearance of MH 
		370, the minister said the two pilots had not asked to fly together, 
		giving no more details.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin Hussein also said Acars communication system had been 
		disabled before last radio contact between plane and air traffic. </p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR </p>
<p>Sun Mar 16, 2014 9:01am EDT </p>
<p>(Reuters) - </p>
<p>Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the 
		pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on a missing jetliner for clues 
		as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off 
		course, the country's police chief said.</p>
<p>Background checks of passengers on Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 
		have drawn a blank, but not every country whose nationals were on board 
		has responded to requests for information, police chief Khalid Abu Bakar 
		told a news conference on Sunday.</p>
<p>No trace of the Boeing 777-200ER has been found since it vanished on 
		March 8 with 239 people on board, but investigators believe it was 
		diverted by someone who knew how to switch off its communications and 
		tracking systems.</p>
<p>Malaysia has appealed for international help in the search for the 
		plane across two corridors stretching from the shores of Caspian Sea to 
		the far south of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>"The search area has been significantly expanded," said Acting 
		Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. "From focusing mainly on 
		shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 
		countries, as well as deep and remote oceans."</p>
<p>The disappearance of the aircraft has baffled investigators, aviation 
		experts and internet sleuths since it vanished from civilian air traffic 
		control screens off Malaysia's east coast less than an hour after taking 
		off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities believe that as the plane crossed the country's 
		northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board 
		shut off its communications systems and turned sharply to the west.</p>
<p>Electronic signals it continued to exchange periodically with 
		satellites suggest it could have continued flying for nearly seven hours 
		after flying out of range of Malaysian military radar off the country's 
		northwest coast, heading towards India.</p>
<p>The plane had enough fuel to fly for about seven-and-a-half to eight 
		hours, Malaysian Airlines' Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said.</p>
<p>PILOTS' HOMES SEARCHED</p>
<p>On Saturday, police special branch officers searched the homes of the 
		captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old 
		Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the 
		international airport.</p>
<p>An experienced pilot, Zaharie has been described by current and 
		former co-workers as a flying enthusiast who spent his off days 
		operating a life-sized flight simulator he had set up at home.</p>
<p>Police chief Khalid said investigators had taken the flight simulator 
		for examination by experts.</p>
<p>Earlier, a senior police official said the flight simulator programs 
		were looked at closely, adding they appeared to be normal ones that 
		allowed players to practice flying and landing in different conditions.</p>
<p>Police sources said they were looking at the personal, political and 
		religious backgrounds of both pilots and the other crew members. Khalid 
		said ground support staff who might have worked on the plane were also 
		being investigated.</p>
<p>A second senior police official told Reuters investigators had found 
		no links between Captain Zaharie, a father of three grown-up children 
		and a grandfather, and any militant group.</p>
<p>Postings on his Facebook page suggest the pilot was a politically 
		active opponent of the coalition that has ruled Malaysia for the 57 
		years since independence.</p>
<p>A day before the plane vanished, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was 
		convicted of sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison, in a ruling 
		his supporters and international human rights groups say was politically 
		influenced.</p>
<p>Asked if Zaharie's background as an opposition supporter was being 
		examined, the first senior police officer would say only: "We need to 
		cover all our bases."</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines has said it did not believe Zaharie would have 
		sabotaged the plane, and colleagues were incredulous.</p>
<p>"Please, let them find the aircraft first. Zaharie is not suicidal, 
		not a political fanatic as some foreign media are saying," a Malaysia 
		Airlines pilot who is close to Zaharie told Reuters. "Is it wrong for 
		anyone to have an opinion about politics?"</p>
<p>Co-pilot Fariq was religious and serious about his career, family and 
		friends said.</p>
<p>The two pilots had not made any request to fly together.</p>
<p>EXPERTS DOUBT MILITANT GROUPS INVOLVED</p>
<p>With no clear motive established as to why someone diverted the 
		plane, Khalid said all possibilities - hijack, sabotage, or personal or 
		psychological problems of someone on board - were being investigated.</p>
<p>Transport Minister Hishammuddin said authorities had not received any 
		ransom or other demand. "That makes if very difficult for us to verify 
		whether its a hijacking or terrorist," he said.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia's homegrown Islamist militant groups, such as Jemaah 
		Islamiah (JI), which carried out the Bali bombings in 2002, have been 
		quiet in recent years after security forces either arrested or shot dead 
		numerous members.</p>
<p>Experts said they doubted the remaining militants had the skills or 
		capabilities to carry out a complex hijacking.</p>
<p>"JI has not been involved with violence in the region since 2007," 
		said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy 
		Analysis of Conflict.</p>
<p>"The other groups that are active in Indonesia, in trying to make 
		terrorist plots, are all not very competent. I would be extremely 
		surprised if any group from Indonesia, the Philippines or Malaysia 
		itself would be directly involved."</p>
<p>Analysis of satellite data showed the last signal from the missing 
		plane was at 8:11 a.m., almost seven hours after it turned back over the 
		Gulf of Thailand and re-crossed the Malay peninsula.</p>
<p>It's location was not pinpointed - experts could only determine that 
		the plane could have been anywhere in either of two arcs: one stretching 
		from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or 
		a southern arc heading from Indonesia to the vast southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin said Malaysia had requested further satellite data from 
		several countries, including the United States, China and France, to 
		help with the search.</p>
<p>A source familiar with official U.S. assessments said it was thought 
		most likely the plane had headed south into the Indian Ocean, where it 
		would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed. Air space to the 
		north is much busier, and the plane would likely have been detected.</p>
<p>Countries contacted by Malaysia to assist in the search range from 
		the former Soviet central Asian republics in the north to Australia in 
		the south, along with France, which administers a scattering of islands 
		deep in the southern Indian Ocean uninhabited except for a handful of 
		researchers.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean is one of the most remote places in the world and 
		also one of the deepest, posing enormous challenges for efforts to find 
		any wreckage or the flight voice and data recorders that would be key to 
		solving the puzzle.</p>
