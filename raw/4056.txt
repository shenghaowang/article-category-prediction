<pre>There were 4.0 million job openings on the last business day of January, little changed from December, <br>
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The hires rate (3.3 percent) and separations rate (3.2 <br/>
percent) were little changed in January. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job <br/>
openings, hires, and separations for the nonfarm sector by industry and by geographic region. The <br/>
release also includes 2013 annual estimates for hires and separations. The annual levels for hires and <br/>
quits increased in 2013 while the annual total for layoffs and discharges decreased.<br/>
<br/>
Job Openings<br/>
<br/>
There were 4.0 million job openings in January, little changed from December. The number of openings <br/>
also was little changed in total private and government. The number of job openings decreased in retail <br/>
trade; the number increased in health care and social assistance and in arts, entertainment, and <br/>
recreation. The West region experienced a rise in job openings in January. (See table 1.)<br/>

|Job openings, hires, and separations data have been revised from December 2000 forward to         |<br/>
|incorporate annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics employment estimates and the Job  |<br/>
|Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) seasonal adjustment factors. In addition, durable      |<br/>
|goods manufacturing and nondurable goods manufacturing data are now available on a seasonally     |<br/>
|adjusted basis. See the note at the end of this release for more information about these changes. |<br/>
|__________________________________________________________________________________________________|<br/>
<br/>
The number of job openings (not seasonally adjusted) increased over the year for total nonfarm and total <br/>
private but decreased for government. Over the year, the number of job openings increased in several <br/>
industries while it decreased in real estate and rental and leasing and in federal government. The <br/>
Midwest and West regions experienced an increase in the number of job openings over the 12 months <br/>
ending in January. (See table 7.)<br/>
<br/>
Hires<br/>
<br/>
There were 4.5 million hires in January, little changed from December. The number of hires was <br/>
essentially unchanged for total private and government. The number of hires fell in January in retail <br/>
trade and in the Midwest. (See table 2.)<br/>
<br/>
Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of hires (not seasonally adjusted) changed little for <br/>
total nonfarm, total private, and government. Hires levels rose over the year in professional and business <br/>
services and in educational services. The number of hires was little changed in all four regions. (See <br/>
table 8.)<br/>
<br/>
Separations<br/>
<br/>
Total separations includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Total separations is <br/>
referred to as turnover. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. Therefore, <br/>
the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers’ willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and <br/>
discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations include separations <br/>
due to retirement, death, and disability, as well as transfers to other locations of the same firm.<br/>
<br/>
There were 4.5 million total separations in January, little changed from December. The number of total <br/>
separations was essentially unchanged for total private and government. (See table 3.)<br/>
<br/>
In January, the quits rate was little changed at 1.7 percent for total nonfarm. The rate was little changed <br/>
for total private (1.9 percent) and unchanged for government (0.6 percent). The quits rate was essentially <br/>
unchanged over the month in all industries and in all four regions. (See table 4.)<br/>
<br/>
The number of quits (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the 12 months ending in January <br/>
for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of quits rose over the year in retail trade <br/>
and professional and business services but fell in finance and insurance. The number of quits was <br/>
essentially unchanged in all four regions over the year. (See table 10.)<br/>
<br/>
The layoffs and discharges rate was little changed in January at 1.3 percent. The rate was unchanged <br/>
over the month for total private (1.4 percent) and government (0.5 percent). The layoffs and discharges <br/>
rate was little changed in all four regions. Seasonally adjusted estimates of layoffs and discharges are <br/>
not available for individual industries. (See table 5.) <br/>
<br/>
The layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the 12 months ending <br/>
in January for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of layoffs and discharges rose <br/>
over the year for several industries but fell in mining and logging. The number of layoffs and discharges <br/>
rose in the Midwest. (See table 11.)<br/>
<br/>
In January, there were 341,000 other separations for total nonfarm, little changed from December. The <br/>
number of other separations also was little changed over the month for total private and government. <br/>
(See table 6.) Seasonally adjusted estimates of other separations are not available for individual <br/>
industries or regions. Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of other separations was little <br/>
changed for total nonfarm, total private, and government. (See table 12.)<br/>
<br/>
Net Change in Employment<br/>
<br/>
Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net <br/>
employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of <br/>
hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining. <br/>
Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even <br/>
if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in January 2014, hires totaled 54.3 <br/>
million and separations totaled 52.1 million, yielding a net employment gain of 2.2 million. These <br/>
figures include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year.<br/>
<br/>
Annual Levels and Rates<br/>
<br/>
This release contains the 2013 annual levels and rates for hires, total separations, quits, layoffs and <br/>
discharges, and other separations. Note that annual figures for job openings are not calculated because <br/>
job openings are measured on a stock, or point-in-time, basis rather than on a flow basis over a specified <br/>
time period. The annual figures and additional tables are published with the release of January data each <br/>
year. (See the Technical Note for additional information on these measures.)<br/>
<br/>
Calculating annual levels and rates allows additional comparisons across years. In 2013, annual levels <br/>
for hires, quits, and other separations rose for the fourth consecutive year. The layoffs and discharges <br/>
annual level decreased in 2013 after holding steady in 2012.<br/>
<br/>
In 2013, annual hires increased to 54.2 million (39.7 percent of employment) and annual total <br/>
separations rose to 51.8 million (38.0 percent of employment). Annual quits increased to 27.6 million <br/>
(20.3 percent of employment) in 2013. Annual layoffs and discharges decreased in 2013 to 20.0 million <br/>
(14.6 percent of employment). Annual other separations rose in 2013 to 4.3 million (3.1 percent of <br/>
employment). (See tables 13 through 22.)<br/>

The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey results for February 2014 are scheduled to be <br/>
released on Tuesday, April 8, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. (EDT).<br/>

  NOTE: Data have been revised to incorporate the annual updates to the Current<br/>
Employment Statistics employment estimates and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment<br/>
factors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                    Revisions to Job Openings and Labor Turnover Data<br/>
<br/>
In accordance with annual practice, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data have <br/>
been revised to reflect annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics (CES), or establishment <br/>
survey, employment estimates. The JOLTS employment levels (not published) are ratio-adjusted to the <br/>
CES employment levels, and the resulting ratios are applied to all JOLTS data elements. In most years, <br/>
this annual benchmark process would result in the revision of 21 months of not seasonally adjusted data.  <br/>
However, this year the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (the sampling frame for both <br/>
JOLTS and CES) reclassified some home services for the elderly and people with disabilities from <br/>
NAICS 814110 (out of scope for JOLTS and CES) to NAICS 624120 (in scope for JOLTS and CES).  <br/>
This reclassification, though not large, required a retabulation of the full JOLTS series from December <br/>
2000 forward. Additionally, new seasonal factors have been developed based on the full revised JOLTS <br/>
series and have been applied to the data from December 2000 forward. (For more information on this <br/>
year’s CES benchmark and the reclassification of jobs, see http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesbmart.pdf.)  <br/>
<br/>
Tables B through G below present revised total nonfarm data for January through December 2013. The <br/>
December 2013 revisions also reflect the routine incorporation of additional sample receipts into the <br/>
final December estimates. Tables presenting revisions to total nonfarm data for December 2000 through <br/>
2012 will be available later today on the JOLTS website. The website also contains all revised <br/>
seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted data. The revision tables and data can be accessed <br/>
through the JOLTS homepage at http://www.bls.gov/jlt/.<br/>
