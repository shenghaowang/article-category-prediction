<p><strong>NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) — </strong>A Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train while working on the tracks overnight.</p>
<p>The railroad said it happened at 12:54 a.m. Monday at Park Avenue and East 106th Street. The employee, identified as James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>About 50 passengers were on board the train, the 12:47 a.m. from Grand Central Terminal bound for Poughkeepsie. The passengers were placed on another train and resumed their trip at 2:17 a.m.</p>
<p>The accident caused disruptions for about two hours.</p>
<p>The incident is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police. But preliminary findings indicate Romansoff went beyond a protected work zone while restoring power to the section of the track, 1010 WINS’ Al Jones reported.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board is also looking into the incident, WCBS 880’s Peter Haskell reported.</p>
<p>“I was shocked and very dismayed to hear about this, it’s a horrible, tragic situation,” Arthur Davidson, general chairman of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers System Council 7, told 1010 WINS.</p>
<p>Sen. Charles Schumer, speaking to reporters at Grand Central Terminal on Monday, said there has been a disturbing pattern with Metro-North.</p>
<p>Last May, a track foreman was killed in West Haven. Conn., and in December, four people were killed when a train derailed in the Bronx.</p>
<p>“Collisions, power failures, derailments, injuries and even deaths,” said Schumer, D-N.Y.</p>
<p>“Something is wrong in the culture of safety.”</p>
<p>As of March 1, a new safety protocol designed to prevent such fatal incidents went into effect.</p>
<p>The Enhanced Employee Protection System prevents dispatchers from sending trains through when employees are working on the tracks until a specific code is received.</p>
<p>“We believe it will set a new standard for the railroad industry,” spokeswoman Marjorie Anders told The Journal News before the system went into effect.</p>
<p>The EEP system “takes the human error out of the equation,” Anthony Bottalico with the Association of Commuter Rail Employees told The Journal News.</p>
<p>Asked if the new safety protocols were being followed in Monday’s accident, an MTA spokesperson told Haskell that Metro-North does follow its procedures.</p>
<p>The union represents 1,700 Metro-North employees.</p>
