<p>American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (NYSE: AEO) reported fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results before markets opened Tuesday. The specialty clothing retailer reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 and revenues of $1.04 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $0.55 on revenue of $1.12 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $0.26 and $1.03 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>For the full year, American Eagle reported EPS of $0.74 on revenues of $3.31 billion, compared with EPS of $1.39 on revenues of $3.48 billion in 2012. The 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year included an extra week, compared with 2013. The consensus estimates called for EPS of $0.73 on revenues of $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>The share price was sinking Tuesday morning because the company’s comments on its first-quarter outlook include a “high single-digit decline” in same-store sales. Earnings are expected to break even, compared with EPS of $0.18 a year ago and a consensus estimate of $0.13. That was all it took to send shares tumbling.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO said:</p>
<p>The Company’s results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations. We’re taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers. Our brands remain incredibly strong and I’m confident in our ability to execute the strategic plan and resume long-term profitable growth.</p>
<p>Shares traded down about 6.8% Tuesday morning, at $13.24 in a 52-week range of $12.59 to $21.07. Thomson Reuters had a consensus analyst price target of around $16.20 before the results were announced.</p>
