<p>
  Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
</p>
<p><strong>Chinese exports tumble. </strong>Chinese exports
  fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6%
  gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in
  February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit
  since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year
  holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data.
  "<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Despite our belief that the
  actual trade situation is better than official
  data </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">suggests, the
  disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese
  yuan</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">(CNY) and the GDP
  growth outlook for Q1 2014," say economists at Standard
  Chartered.</span></p>
<p><strong>Chinese inflation disappoints.</strong> China's consumer
  price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing
  from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing
  market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's
  producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier,
  marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year
  drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Copper falls. </strong>
<span>Copper futures slid
  more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China.
  However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading
  near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span><strong>Quiet markets. </strong>Futures point to a
  quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&amp;P
  500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from
  Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and
  the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of
  Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the
  Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell
  2.9%.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Japan GDP growth revised down.</strong> Revised GDP data
  suggest <a href="https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304704504579429773036857740">
  Japan's economy expanded only 0.7%</a> at an annualized pace in
  the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate.
  Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from
  5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main
  drags on the headline number.
</p>
<p><strong>Record Japanese deficits.</strong> Japan also announced a
  record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The
  deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade
  deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion.
  "<span>Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next
  April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration
  of the balance of payments," says Osamu Takashima, a Citi
  strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of
  the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month
  high.</strong> A survey of euro zone investor confidence
  conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest
  confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to
  13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market
  economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take — the
  consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this
  month.
</p>
<p><strong>Cross-border lending contracts.</strong> The latest data
  from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing
  decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of
  2013. "International banking activity was characterised by lower
  credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013,
  mirroring developments in the previous quarter," said the BIS in
  its <a href="http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1403.htm">Quarterly Review
  published Sunday</a>. "Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466
  billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this
  contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late
  2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most
  pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or
  4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres
  ($35 billion or 1.7%)."
</p>
<p><strong>Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine.</strong> Pro-Russian
  military forces <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-forces-tighten-grip-on-crimea-2014-3">
  tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region</a> over the
  weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international
  watchdogs who tried to enter the region. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">"Ukraine remains very much a potential
  dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for
  safe haven flow," write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a
  note to clients this morning. "</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For now, though, the market looks to still
  be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle
  as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports
  informing the market rather than any possible concern over
  possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports
  across Ukraine)."</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>ECB not happy with euro
  strength.</strong> ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of
  France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is
  not happy with the euro's recent strength. <span>"It’s a
  very important input in the economic development and inflation
  development," Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with
  Manus Cranny in Paris. "When the euro tends to strengthen, it
  creates additional downward pressure on the economy and
  inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not
  happy at the moment." The Governing Council declined to announce
  any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting
  last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's
  comments.</span></span>
