<p>French mobile operator Bouygues Telecom has submitted a revised offer for Vivendi’s telecoms unit <span class="caps">SFR</span>. According to a company press release, Bouygues Telecom proposes to lift its initial offer by EUR1 billion (USD1.39 billion); under the terms set out by the updated bid, Bouygues Telecom is tabling a bid of EUR11.3 billion in cash (an increase of EUR800 million), as well as a 43% interest in the enlarged, newly established entity. The new offer values Bouygues’ larger rival <span class="caps">SFR</span> at EUR15.5 billion (pre-synergies) and at nearly EUR20 billion after taking in all synergies. Further, Bouygues pledges to facilitate an initial public offering (<span class="caps">IPO</span>) as soon as the merger is completed, giving an immediate opportunity for Vivendi to monetise its interest.</p>
<p>As previously reported by TeleGeography’s CommsUpdate, last week Vivendi received two bids for France’s second largest mobile provider in terms of subscribers, from domestic broadband operator Numericable, majority owned by Luxembourg-based investment fund Altice Group, and Bouygues; both suitors initially valued <span class="caps">SFR</span> at around EUR19 billion–EUR20 billion. Earlier this week, Vivendi asked all interested parties to submit their final offers before its board of directors meeting, scheduled for 14 March 2014; however, Patrick Drahi, <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Altice Group, reportedly said that he will not raise his bid for <span class="caps">SFR</span>. Numericable and its parent offered a bid which consists of EUR11 billion in cash (comprising EUR8 billion in debt and EUR3 million via a capital increase) and 32% of the newly merged entity.</p>
