<p>NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold surged 1.3 percent on Wednesday, hitting a near six-month high as fears of more corporate defaults in China and the geopolitical tug-of-war between Russia, Ukraine and the West boosted bullion’s appeal as an insurance against riskier assets. </p>
<p>China’s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world’s second-biggest economy, sending London copper prices to their lowest in 44 months. Copper is often put up as collateral for lending. </p>
<p>Fears that China’s economy, the world’s second largest after the United States, is slowing triggered gold buying and dampened demand for riskier assets such as equities. </p>
<p>“For these last sessions, we have had a very definitive China-led safe-haven bid,” said Frank McGhee, head precious metals dealer at Chicago commodities brokerage Alliance Financial LLC. </p>
<p>“Gold benefits from China’s bond default and the industrial metals are getting whacked on the anticipation that China is slowing much quicker than people thought,” he said. </p>
<p>Spot gold gained 1.3 percent to $1,367.04 an ounce by 1:59 p.m. EDT (1759 GMT), having reached $1,370.60, the loftiest since September 20. </p>
<p>U.S. COMEX gold futures for April delivery settled up $23.80 at $1,370.50 an ounce. </p>
<p>Trading volume was about 250,000 lots, 65 percent above its 30-day average, preliminary Reuters data showed. Wednesday’s turnover is set to be its highest since January 29. </p>
<p>Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are also weighing on appetite for risk globally on a growing chance of western sanctions over Crimea. </p>
<p>The Group of Seven advanced economies will demand that Russia halt efforts to annex Ukraine’s Crimea region in a statement to be issued on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The market is awaiting the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on March 18-19. The U.S. central bank is most likely to announce another $10 billion cut to its monthly bond-buying stimulus, even after a series of U.S. economic data showing that growth has been hurt by harsh winter weather. </p>
<p>In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock. </p>
<p>In other precious metals, silver gained 2.1 percent to $21.25 an ounce. Platinum was up 0.8 percent at $1,469 an ounce, while palladium rose 0.8 percent to $771.10 an ounce. </p>
