<p>After what can only be called an epic saga, Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank are finally merging. In the end, it is Men’s Wearhouse who today announced that it will acquire Jos. A. Bank, the smaller of the two rivals, for $1.8 billion. The deal comes after months of counterbidding, boardroom maneuvering, and shareholder tactics between the two suitors. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-josabank-offer-menswearhouse-idUSBREA2A18H20140311" target="_blank">Here’s Reuters</a> with the walk down memory lane <strong>(bolded labels added)</strong>:</p>
<p>As part of their merger deal, Jos. A. Bank will terminate its plans to acquire Eddie Bauer, a move that was meant to bulk up the company and make it more difficult and expensive for Men’s Wearhouse to buy. The companies haven’t released information on potential store closings – they duplicate each other in many malls – but <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579433170684354260?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304250204579433170684354260.html " target="_blank">according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the retailers have no plans to rebrand or remodel Jos. A. Bank stores.</p>
