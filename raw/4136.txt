<p class="speakable"> State officials say the numbers came in as expected. </p>
<p class="speakable"> On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/28/us/10-things-colorado-recreational-marijuana/">recreational marijuana</a> to anyone age 21 or older. Cannabis purchases are limited to one ounce. It's the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale. </p>

<p> Colorado places a 15% excise tax, a 10% special sales tax and a 2.9% sales tax on recreational marijuana, in addition to application and license fees. It imposes just a 2.9% sales tax, as well as application on license fees, on medical marijuana, which was legalized by voters in Colorado in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/12/14/colorado.medical.marijuana/">2000</a>. </p>
<p> When combined with taxes and fees from medicinal marijuana, the state brought in a total of $3.5 million in January from pot sales. </p>
<p> The state also taxes alcohol, which brought in about $5.1 million in taxes in December, the most recent data available from the Colorado Department of Revenue. </p>
<p> A big chunk of the funds collected from marijuana taxes will be funneled to programs <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/20/news/economy/marijuana-taxes-colorado/">aimed at keeping kids way from pot</a>. The governor has requested funds for the prevention of youth marijuana, for treatment of substance use, regulatory oversight, and law enforcement and public safety. </p>
