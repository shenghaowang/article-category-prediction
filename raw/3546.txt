  Citing sources, UK newspaper The Independent reported that
  Malaysian investigators had requested permission from the
  Pakistani government to follow up a theory that the missing
  passenger jet had landed close to the border with Afghanistan.
  The Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, disappeared from radars last
  week on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Since then,
  authorities have been unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the
  plane, and have not found any wreckage from a crash.
  <br/><br/>
  The Pakistani government says it has no record of the craft
  entering its airspace, but has told the Malaysian investigators
  it is ready to share all available information. In addition, The
  Kazakh Civil Aviation Committee has said that although the
  Malaysian Airlines plane could have reached Kazakhstan, their
  radars would have picked it up.
</p>
<p><em>"No information about the Malaysian plane is available at our
  radar as it has not entered our airspace,"</em> Foreign Ministry
  spokesperson Tasnim Aslam told reporters when asked to comment on
  the Malaysian government's request. <em>“Our radar system has no
  information about the Malaysian aircraft as it has never
  contacted our control tower.”</em></p>
<p>
  Pakistan is now one of 25 countries participating in the search
  for the missing plane.
</p>
<p>
  The Malaysian authorities are investigating a myriad of theories
  of how the plane disappeared and have not ruled out a possible
  terrorist attack.

  On Saturday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that
  investigators had reliable information that someone on the plane
  had <em>“deliberately disabled”</em> communications systems
  before the plane vanished. Furthermore, investigators said that
  it would have taken someone with pilot training to be able to
  switch off the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and
  Reporting System, or ACARS. This system automatically sends
  engine data and other information to the airline.
</p>
<p>
  On Sunday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a
  news conference that the last words to be spoken to air traffic
  control from onboard the plane were <em>“All right, good
  night.”</em> This was said after the ACARS system had been
  switched off and there was no mention of any inflight problems.
  <br/><br/>
  In connection with this new information, authorities are now
  investigating the pilot, 53-year-old Captain Zaharie Shah. On
  Sunday authorities searched his home, interviewed his family and
  took away for analysis a flight simulator he used to practice
  with in his spare time. The home of co-pilot Fariq Abdul, 27, was
  also searched.
  <br/><br/>
  In light of the new information, Hussein said that we must not
  jump to conclusions too quickly as the two pilots did not request
  to be onboard together and they had also not asked for any extra
  fuel.
  <br/><br/>
  Malaysian authorities have almost completely ruled out the
  possibility that one of the passengers had a hand in disabling
  the communications systems. Khalid Abu Bakar, inspector general
  of Malaysia’s police, said that they had “cleared” most of the
  passengers on the plane.
