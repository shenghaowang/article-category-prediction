<p style="font-family:Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14.44444465637207px">The demand is so great that warehouse space is renting for four times the price it fetched before marijuana sales began in Colorado, the<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_25316132/pot-growing-warehouses-short-supply-demand-legal-weed"> Denver Post reports.</a></p>

<p style="font-family:Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14.44444465637207px">“Commercial real estate tracker Xceligent estimates that marijuana cultivation and manufacturing facilities in the city occupy about 4.5 million square feet (418,064 square metres) — the equivalent of 78 football fields.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14.44444465637207px">"This industry has come on so fast that initially I was uneasy — it seemed like a fad,” said Brad Calbert, president of the Colliers International brokerage in Denver. “But what’s making it sustainable is supply, demand and capital. Supply is deficient, demand is excessive, and capital is abundant.”</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14.44444465637207px">That represents about $US14 ($15.49) million worth of pot, sold from about 59 businesses.</p>
