<p>Investing.com - Gold prices eased in early Asian trade on
Thursday following sharp gains overnight as the standoff in the
Ukraine escalated and bolstered gold's appeal as a safe-haven.
<br/>
<br/>

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery traded at $1,365.70 a troy ounce, down
0.35%, after hitting an overnight session low of $1,345.70 and off
a high of $1,371.20.
<br/>
<br/>

Ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine bolstered gold's appeal as
a hedge on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>

Leaders of the Group of Seven largest industrial nations warned
Russia on Wednesday not to annex Crimea.
<br/>
<br/>

In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of Crimea
"could have grave implications for the legal order that protects
the unity and sovereignty of all states."
<br/>
<br/>

Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with
further action "individually and collectively."
<br/>
<br/>

Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will meet with
U.S. President Barack Obama later in the day, as diplomatic efforts
to resolve the crisis continue.
<br/>
<br/>

Still, uncertainty as to how policymakers on all sides will
navigate their way out of the crisis fueled safe-haven demand for
the yellow metal.
<br/>
<br/>

Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 0.37% at US$21.278 a
troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were up 0.08% at
US$2.956 a pound.</p>
