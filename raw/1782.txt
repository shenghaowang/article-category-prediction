<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">U.S. Navy SEALs stormed a North Korean oil tanker off the coast of Cyprus last night after it was stolen and held for ransom by a mob of armed Libyan rebels.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Under cover of darkness, the elite team of commandos swooped onto the </font><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The Morning Glory</font><font style="font-size:1.2em;"> from a helicopter after tracking it down to a bolt hole some 18 miles southwest of the island nation.<br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">A Pentagon spokesman said they were met with next to no resistance as they </font><font style="font-size:1.2em;">swept silently through the vessel's corridors and cabins, arresting all inside. Nobody was injured in the operation.<br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The vessel was stolen from the port of Es Sider last month by Libyan anti-Government insurgents, who are demanding a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy from the country's fledgling administration.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">They </font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">had managed to load crude oil onto the 37,000 tonne-tanker, which escaped the Libyan navy, embarrassing the weak central government and prompting parliament to vote the prime minister out of offic</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">e.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">No one was hurt in the boarding operation, approved by U.S. President Barack Obama, requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters southeast of Cyprus, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">'The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained' from the Libyan port of Es Sider, his statement said.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The Cypriot ministry of foreign affairs said the vessel was now heading west in the Mediterranean with a U.S. military escort. It was parked 18 miles southwest of Cyprus when the operation occurred around midnight Cyprus time.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The standoff over control of OPEC member Libya's oil is one facet of wider turmoil that has engulfed the vast North African country since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi nearly three years ago.</font></p>
