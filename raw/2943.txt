<p>General Motors shares took a big <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579433354067905812?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection&amp;mg=reno64-wsj" target="_blank">hit</a> Tuesday as a federal probe was launched into the automaker’s handling of defects complaints tied to 12 deaths.</p>
<p>General Motors stock fell 5%, or $1.91 per share to close at $35.18 in trading Tuesday on reports of the news, and continued to fall Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The kingpin automaker is under intense scrutiny for its response to complaints about faulty ignition switches, which led last month to a <a href="http://time.com/20961/congress-investigates-gms-recall-of-1-6-million-vehicles/" target="_blank">recall</a> of 1.6 million cars. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is leading the probe, reports the Wall Street <em>Journal</em>, but lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives are also investigating. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) said Monday the House Energy and Commerce Committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain in use without recalling them.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recorded a July 2005 death when safety bags did not deploy in a Chevrolet Cobalt, and pointed out the problem to GM in March 2007. The automaker did not recall the vehicles until this year.</p>
<p>The recall of 1.6 million autos covers the 2003-’07 Saturn Ion, the 2006-’07 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-’07 Pontiac Solstice, the 2007 Saturn Sky, and the 2005-’07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.</p>
