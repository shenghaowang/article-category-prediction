<p>China\’s central bank on Saturday <a href='\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303546204579440813396189476?KEYWORDS=yuan&amp;mg=reno64-wsj\"'>doubled the trading band</a> of the yuan, news reports said, a move that will allow the currency to fluctuate within a 2% band on either side of a rate set each day by the bank. The move isn\’t a big surprise, but it is viewed as another significant step toward a freer-floating currency at the same time concerns are on the rise over a <a href='\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304585004579416433783632294\"'>possible credit crunch</a> and a slowdown of the world\’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>China has been seen guiding the yuan lower since the beginning of 2013. Analysts say China wants to discourage market participants from engaging in a popular strategy known as a carry trade, in which traders sell a low-interest currency, such as the U.S. dollar, and use it to buy higher-yielding currencies, such as the yuan, and other assets. <a href='\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/06/12/chinese-yuan-carry-trade-going-gangbusters-but-watch-your-step-warns-deutsche-bank/\"'>Read more about the development of the yuan carry trade</a>.</p>
<p>A stronger yuan makes Chinese exports more expensive to foreign buyers. Heavy inflows of foreign funds also contribute to soaring prices for property and other assets, stoking bubble fears.</p>
<p><span 13px;\"="" style='\"font-size:'>The move \”is coming at a time when a credit crunch should be creating outflows out of China, suggesting that the timing indicates an interest in weakening [the yuan] or at least [inflicting] significant pain\” on the yuan carry trade, said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale, by email.</span></p>
<p>It also comes at a time when a weaker yuan has been tied to a <a href='\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/12/chinas-role-in-coppers-collapse-why-investors-should-care/\"'>sharp drop in copper prices</a>, which has also amplified worries about the stability of China\’s financial system.</p>
