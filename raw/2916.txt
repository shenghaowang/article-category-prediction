<p>Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956.</p>
<p>Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/10/transit-ridership-grew-in-2013/6137911/" target="_blank" title="reports">reports</a>.</p>
<p>The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.</p>
