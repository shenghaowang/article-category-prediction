<p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney says interest rates could hit 3 per cent in the next three years as he launched a robust defence of his forward guidance policy.</p>
<p>Last August, Carney said interest rates would not rise until unemployment fell below 7 per cent. After unemployment fell rapidly he adjusted the threshold in February to a range of 18 economic indicators.</p>
<p>At a Treasury select committee hearing this morning, MPs argued forward guidance was “dead and buried”.</p>
<p>Carney told MPs the change had only been made to boost transparency of forecasting and was not related to the drop in unemployment. He said the new measures were entirely down to greater transparency and more accurate economic forecasting.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Brooks Newmark said the changes showed forward guidance had been traded in for “fuzzy guidance”.</p>
<p>Carney said: “We provided guidance that was well understood. Businesses indicated it gave them greater confidence in the recovery and influenced hiring and spending decisions, contributing to falling unemployment.</p>
<p>“These 18 indicators are not part of the new forward guidance. They are the fulfilment of a commitment the Bank made to implement recommendations to improve transparency and forecasting. We have provided more detail about our forecasts and it allows greater perspective.”</p>
<p>Carney said the path of interest rates was clear over three years and could hit 3 per cent within three years.</p>
<p>He said: “Interest rates will rise on a gradual and limited extent. Some Monetary Policy Committee members have put more precise figures on when interest rates will rise over the three-year horizon. Charlie Bean said [an increase of] 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent and I don’t think that is an unreasonable sense to get across.”</p>
<p>Carney admitted he had no control over parts of the London housing market which were fuelled by cash buyers, claiming he could only prevent bubbles where markets were driven by mortgages.</p>
<p>TSC chair Andrew Tyrie also hit out at the MPC for destroying recordings of its meetings. Tyrie asked Carney to review the policy, saying the records are of “huge historical importance”.</p>
<p>But deputy Bank governor Paul Fisher argued retaining MPC minutes could make discussions less frank and more inhibited.</p>
<p>A Labour government would scrap pot follows member reforms if it wins at the next election, Money Marketing understands. Under the reforms, pension pots of £10,000 or less would move with a worker when they change jobs in order to stop dormant pensions being left with old employers. Labour favours a central aggregator model, where […]</p>
<p>The FCA is to kick-start its new consumer credit regime with an in-depth thematic review into payday lenders’ debt collection practices.

<p>The purveyors of attitude to risk questionnaires have made a nice living out of persuading financial advisers that by using such a questionnaire they give better advice and reduce the risk of complaints. I have always been sceptical about this, for two main reasons: The FCA does not require advisers to measure the client’s attitude […]</p>
<p>Purchasing a house is one of the key life stages that prompts people to consider taking out protection. But the UK’s resurgent housing market will not necessarily see more people protecting what matters most in their lives. Life cover sales far outstrip those of any other form of protection. This is partly because it is […]</p>
<p>The UK is ending what has been its slowest economic recovery on record with a marked acceleration in growth. Neptune’s forecast for UK GDP growth in 2014 is 2.5 per cent, up from 2013 growth of 1.8 per cent as estimated by the Office for National Statistics. When considering the changing UK macro outlook, three important questions remain:</p>

			There are 2 comments			at the moment, we would love to hear your opinion too.</p>
<p>Why is it that when confidence is bouncing back to the economy, the press continue to focus on the negative. After 2 hours of presenting the BOE forward guidance which has obviously worked, all the press can do is continue to push the tiring issue of interest rates increasing. This idiotic persistence on this subject can put fear into the public and create the self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>There have been so many positives received in recent times which has been the driving force to a sustained economic recovery. </p>
<p>Lack of confidence caused the economic problems in the first instance and reviving this confidence is the only way to go.</p>
<p>The press has indisputably prolonged the economic recovery – for what reason? Simply idiotic. </p>
<p>This is a  widespread general belief.</p>
<p>Probably because outside the South East / London bubble, things really aren’t that rosy. </p>
<p>And probably because a lot of the ‘recovery’ has been built on consumer borrowing, so a rise in interest rates could be cataclysmic for many.</p>
