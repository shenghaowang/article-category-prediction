<p>LONDON: Gold hit a near six-month high on Wednesday, as fears of more corporate defaults in China and the geopolitical tug-of-war between Russia, Ukraine and the West hurt equity markets, boosting the metal's appeal 
as an insurance against risk.</p>
<p>Spot gold rose as much as 1.4 per cent to its highest since Sept. 19 at $1,368.40 an ounce in earlier trading and was up 1.2pc at $1,365.50 an ounce by 1457 GMT.</p>
<p>US gold futures also rose to a near six-month high of $1,369.00 an ounce, before trading at $1,365.70, up 1.4pc.</p>
<p>In China, the world's biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. 
Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20.
In other precious metals, silver gained 1.2pc to $21.10 an ounce.—Reuters</p>
