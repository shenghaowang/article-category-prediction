<p>Paul Vlosich of Uniontown hands his health insurance card to Carol Reynolds, office assistant at Family Behavioral Services in Oliver Square.</p>
<p>The latest data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows that nearly 160,000 Pennsylvanians have selected a health-care plan under the Affordable Care Act since the marketplace opened five months ago.</p>
<p>That number is up from the 123,681 reported at the end of January.</p>
<p>Aaron Zolbrod, who sells insurance through the Health Insurance Store in Connellsville, said he has been seeing 10 to 12 people a day.</p>
<p>“Those are people who are looking for us to help see if they qualify for a subsidy, and we’re helping them to create an account,” he said. “We’re doing the application from start to finish and advising on the plans that look like the best value for them.”</p>
<p>The newest figure is close to the 164,800 that the Obama administration initially had hoped would sign up in Pennsylvania through the end of February.</p>
<p>The administration, however, is predicting 206,000 signups in total, by the time the enrollment period ends on March 31.</p>
<p>But that’s only less than two weeks away.</p>
<p>And for the uninsured who opt not to get coverage, they face penalties.</p>
<p>The fine is $95 per adult, or 1 percent of the person’s yearly household income, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>However, for a four-person family, with no insured members, the maximum fine is $285 — $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of the taxable income, Zolbrod said.</p>
<p>According to Zolbrod, the maximum penalty for a family is $2,085, if the 1 percent is greater than $285.</p>
<p>There is no penalty for a single gap in coverage of less than three months.</p>
<p>Zolbrod, however, doesn’t think the fine is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>“If you don’t get it by March 31, you can’t get it for the rest of the year,” he said. “If you get sick in May, and you don’t have insurance, you can’t get insurance until Jan. 1, 2015. That’s the worse part about it.”</p>
<p>He said a huge problem is that the people who need this the most don’t know what’s going on.</p>
<p>“We’re surprised that we’re not seeing more people that work at McDonald’s, or people who are waiters and waitresses,” he said. “They’re not getting the proper information they need. I don’t think they’ve (the government) done a good enough job reaching out to those people.”</p>
<p>While Zolbrod said he can’t speak for the entire country, or even other counties across the state, he believes the federal legislation has been “very good” overall for the people of Fayette County and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>“The majority of people are paying premiums anywhere from $20 a month to $100 a month, with deductibles between $100 and $1,000,” he said. “So that’s really good. I can’t speak for other counties, but there are definitely people who have not been able to afford insurance who are much better off now, and able to afford it.”</p>
<p>He said while he doesn’t agree with the entire piece of legislation, from what he has seen, it has been beneficial for people who have pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>“I could have cancer but get the same price as my neighbor who is healthy. That is awesome,” Zolbrod said. “Prior to this, we were always trying to get people insured who have health issues. I had people coming in paying $600, $700, $800, $900 premiums a month. The beauty of it is that we don’t have to worry about that anymore.”</p>
<p>National numbers showed that 4.2 million people signed up for health insurance through March 1. The government’s initial target was 7 million by the end of March, but it has since revised that to 6 million.</p>
<p>Zolbrod said he’s put 449 people, who received subsidies, through the federal marketplace. For those who received subsidies, that means they’ll get help with premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
<p>And he’s signed up about another 100 people who did not receive subsidies.</p>
<p>Paul Vlosich of Uniontown has received a subsidy and said the Affordable Care Act has been a benefit to him.</p>
<p>“I do outpatient mental counseling at a local clinic and, underneath this plan, it’s a $10 copay for mental health outpatient, which is huge because mental health was not considered similar or equal to a regular doctor’s visit before,” he said. “I’m now enjoying two counseling sessions per month.”</p>
<p>Under Vlosich’s previous plan, he said all services had to be paid at full price until the $2,500 deductible was met.</p>
<p>Under his new plan, the deductible decreased to $1,500.</p>
<p>“You would have to spend that before the coverage started helping you,” he said.</p>
<p>While the deductible is high, he’s pleased that the company he works for no longer takes money out of his paycheck every two weeks.</p>
<p>Previously, he paid about $70 a month in premiums per paycheck, and now he’s shelling out $59 a month in premiums.</p>
<p>“There has to be a trade-off, though,” he said. “You’re going to pay a lot less money, but you have to remember to send that check out every month, or they will drop you for not paying.”</p>
<p>Vlosich, like other Americans, at first had technical difficulty with signing up. It wasn’t until the insurance card arrived in the mail that it became real.</p>
<p>“I kept calling Highmark every other day — am I going to have my coverage? Am I going to have my coverage? By the end of the first month, I was like doubting if it was real. When it did show up, I remember showing it off at Christmas to the family members.”</p>
