<p>NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, as equities recouped much of their earlier declines amid signs of progress in diplomatic attempts to ease tensions surrounding Ukraine. </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in London on Friday ahead of a referendum Sunday on whether the Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula will join Russia or go independent. </p>
<p>“People are just kind of reassessing, they are looking at that headline and thinking maybe it is not going to turn out to be a disaster in Russia and Ukraine,” said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. </p>
<p>“It’s good they are talking and it’s good Kerry is going to do it before the weekend - if they do something on Friday to allay any fear over the weekend, that is a positive.” </p>
<p>Stocks had fallen earlier in the session on concerns about a weakening economy in China. London copper, seen as a proxy for China’s economic health, rebounded after hitting its lowest level since July 2010. </p>
<p>Geopolitical developments have moved to the forefront this week as a dearth of fresh corporate results and economic data offered no catalysts to push the benchmark S&amp;P index above its most recent record close on Friday. </p>
<p>“We’ve climbed so far, to continue to climb is definitely going to be a see-saw move,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. </p>
<p>Ukraine’s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea, but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalize rule from Moscow within days. </p>
<p>EU member states have agreed the wording of sanctions on Russia, including travel restrictions and asset freezes against those responsible for violating the sovereignty of Ukraine, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. </p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.54 points, or 0.09 percent, to 16,336.71, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.16 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,865.47 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.291 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,313.478. </p>
<p>EPL Oil &amp; Gas Inc jumped 29.4 percent to $37.65 after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion, including debt. Energy XXI shares lost 6.3 percent to $21.90. </p>
<p>Express Inc dropped 11.3 percent to $16.18 after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations. </p>
<p>Oxigene Inc surged 103.7 percent to $4.93. The company said its experimental drug Zybrestat, combined with Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a midstage clinical trial. </p>
<p>Geron Corp plunged 63.2 percent to $1.82. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a halt to trials of its cancer drug imetelstat over concerns about potential liver damage.    (Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)</p>
