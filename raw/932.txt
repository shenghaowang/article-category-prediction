<p class="article-summary">WASHINGTON - The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest today with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts.

Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen�s first news conference as Fed chairwoman.</p> <p>The financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.</p> <p>Will Yellen embrace predecessor Ben Bernanke�s approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed�s economic stimulus?</p> <p>Or, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?</p> <p>No major announcements are expected when the meeting ends on Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it might drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed to raise short-term rates eventually. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.</p> <p>The Fed�s most-recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows � well past� the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials recently have suggested scrapping that threshold and instead describing more-general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.</p> <p>Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there�s � not a large expectation� that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.</p> <p>One reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market�s health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they�re no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.</p></p>
