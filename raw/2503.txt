<p class="article-dek col-8">It seems that a large, logical brain isn't enough to crush it at Candy Crush. Its mathematical difficulty level is very high.</p>
<p class="speakableTextP1">I confess that I occasionally laugh at my mathematician friends. (They laugh at me all the time.)</p>
<p class="speakableTextP2">What stirs me is the stimulus/response mechanism that urges them to reduce everything to math. It doesn't matte whether it's global warming or intercontinental warring, they can find a mathematical answer.</p>
<p>I know it's not (always) their fault, but when they start to discuss who ate what at dinner, in order to split the check, my teeth begin to talk among themselves.</p>
<p>I am secretly overjoyed, therefore, that mathematicians have declared that something mundane is quite difficult for them.<!--pagebreak-->

<p>No, not NPR'd. NP-hard. 
</p>
<p>This doesn't stand for "No Point, but hard." Although it should. Instead, it's a mathematical term that describes the number of times a mathematician must furrow her brow, while drinking several gallons of scotch in order to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Should you have so far failed to play Candy Crush -- you're invited to my house for dinner and a Lava Vine grenache as a gesture of respect -- it's a game where bright pieces of candy move around and you're supposed to line them up. Or something like that.</p>
<p>This didn't deter <a data-component="externalLink" href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toby Walsh</a>, adjunct professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Australia's University of New South Wales (among other things), to analyze this game and designate it a certification.</p>
<p>Please don't force me to take you through all his methodology. I am very results-oriented. I can tell you that he manipulated the little pieces of candy to simulate the famous Boolean satisfiability problem.</p>
<p>This attempts to see whether successive logical statements are in line with each other or not.</p>
<p>Some people call this a first date.</p>
<p>Walsh's conclusion is that Candy Crush is <a data-component="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NP-complete</a>, a strain of NP-hard. Another example of an NP-complete problem is the <a data-component="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Traveling Salesman Problem</a>, one which finds the shortest route to send a salesman on his way.</p>
<p>Any Candy Crush player who suddenly wants to show off their intelligence to their non-Crushing friends should consider first that this game isn't the only one that's deemed NP-hard.

<p>Still, the next time you're being given a hard time by a mathematician for your mental ineptitude, you can try to get him to beat you at Candy Crush.</p>
<p>It'll be inane, but you might enjoy it. For at least 30 minutes.</p>
