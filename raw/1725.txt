<p>Colorado has collected $2m in marijuana taxes since it became the first US state to legalise the drug for commercial sales.</p>
<p>Figures reveal the state's 59 marijuana firms made $14m (Â£8.4m) in gross sales in January, the first month under the new laws.</p>
<p>Colorado legalised cannabis in 2012 but commercial sales did not begin until January, when 24 recreational pot shops were opened.</p>
<p>In total, the state collected a total of $3.5m in marijuana taxes if medicinal marijuana firms are included.</p>
<p>Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said the cash would be ploughed into youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment and public health.</p>
<p>There are currently 20 US states, including Washington, DC, which allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold.</p>
<p>Barack Obama recently told New Yorker magazine he did not think marijuana was more dangerous than alcohol but still thought it was a "bad idea".</p>
<p>But the President has instructed the Department of Justice to stop banks that do business with cannabis firms being prosecuted.</p>
<p>Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year.</p>
