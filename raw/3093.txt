<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/mw">MW</a>

) said Tuesday it will buy its smaller rival Jos. A. Bank (

<p>J.C. Penney Co. (
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/jcp">JCP</a>

) shares rallied Tuesday, advancing over 8% after analysts at
Citigroup today recommended buying the retailer's stock, citing its
budding turnaround.</p>
<p>The department-store retailer last week reported a 2% rise in Q4
sales at stores open at least 12 months or more, which "bodes well"
for future sales growth, according to Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen
in a new research note today explaining his upgrade for the stock
to Buy from Neutral.</p>
<p>JCP "is early in this go-forward phase but we like the
risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes
will support guidance for growth in 2014," Chen wrote.</p>
<p>JCP shares were up 8.6% at $9.21 each in recent trade, climbing
to an intra-day high of $9.28 a share and, at least temporarily,
erasing the stock's year-to-date drop in its share price. The stock
slid to a 52-week low of $4.90 a share on Feb. 4 and again on Feb.
5 despite reporting positive growth of 3.1% in same-store sales
during the nine weeks including the Q4 holiday season. Since that
time, the stock was risen almost 72% through Monday's close.</p>
