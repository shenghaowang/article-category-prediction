<p>Singapore: Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 4-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal`s safe-haven appeal.</p>
<p>Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at USD 1,355 an ounce, traders said.</p>
<p>Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing over 1 percent.</p>
<p>"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.</p>
<p>"It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said.</p>
<p>"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold`s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets."</p>
