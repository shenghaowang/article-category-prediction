<p>According to the Reuters poll, more than half (32 out of 63) of the economists surveyed believed that the Fed would increase short-term rates in the June or September quarters of 2015, while 14 of 63 believed the rate increase could happen before the second half of next year. Only six economists forecasted a later rate increase than quarter three 2015. Only two out of the three number-crunchers gave a general prediction of 2015.</p>
<p>The Fed has kept short-term interest rates low, or at near-zero levels since December 2008, pursuant to stimulating the U.S. economy, and has maintained this so-called “ultra-easy” monetary policy since then, as the economy recovered from the doldrums of 2008.</p>
<p>Speaking in general, the economists surveyed said that the U.S. unemployment rates may go below 6 percent sometime next year, particularly in the second half, hence necessitating an increase in rates and a change in policy. “You are looking at an unemployment rate that probably gets below 6 percent by the second half of 2015 and that’s within a hair’s breath of full employment,” said Bank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson. “It will start to push up wage growth by that period.” Conversely, Moody’s Analytics senior economist Ryan Sweet posited that the Fed may “start to raise interest rates sooner than the markets expect.”</p>
<p>The Reuters survey generated a average forecast of 6.4 percent for the unemployment rate in 2014. This may be indicative of this key statistic crossing the 6.5 percent threshold that central bank policymakers have set as a trigger for potential interest rate increases from near-zero levels. For 2015, the economists believe that the jobless rate could reach 5.9 percent. The metric was at 6.6 percent in January 2014, but had ticked up slightly to 6.7 percent as of last month’s reading; with unemployment figures trending downwards, the Fed has since decided to start tapering, or cutting back on its asset purchases, and is now making these purchases to the tune of $65 billion per month. A similar $10 billion taper is expected to be confirmed at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which takes place from March 18 through 19.</p>
<p>In other key takeaways from the survey, the economists forecasted faster wage growth, what with drag in the employment market substantially less evident than it was before. Nonfarm payrolls may average about 200,000 new jobs created per month in the June ending quarter of 2014, following laggard job creation in the March quarter. Employment stats in the March frame, among other figures, are believed by experts to be skewered due to unusually harsh weather in the winter months.</p>
<p>Additionally, the economists opined that the increase in wages pertained to above may not result in an increase in inflation, as slower growth rates in emerging countries may serve as the proverbial albatross preventing commodity price growth. Another variable that may keep inflation from building up, according to the survey, is a stronger greenback in relation to world currencies.</p>
