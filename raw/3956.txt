 “I send my condolences to the friends, family, and colleagues of the Metro North worker killed early this morning as he repaired a track in East Harlem," said U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. "The safety problems at Metro North are a matter of life and death, for both passengers and employees, and the culture that allows these frequent mistakes cannot continue.  I spent my morning meeting with commuters at the train station. They are frustrated and worried. I am eager to see Metro North’s new leadership bring the change necessary to make this essential transportation system safe and reliable.”
