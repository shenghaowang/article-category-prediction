<p>Kansas is considering joining Alabama and seven other states in a “<a href="http://healthcarecompact.org/">Health Care Compact</a>” that would, should it receive the unlikely approval of Congress, allow them to opt out of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The compact, which passed the Alabama Legislature last year, would allow participating states to use federal funding that currently goes to health care programs such as Medicare however they see fit. </p>
<p>Federal funding that is spent on military, veteran and native American health care would be exempt, as would funding for programs run by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. States would assume authority over all other federal funding that is spent on health care.</p>
<p>“In member states, states can suspend federal health care regulations,” the national organization backing the effort says <a href="http://healthcarecompact.org/">on its website</a>.</p>
<p>The compact was conceived by <a href="http://www.cg-action.org/">Competitive Governance Alliance</a>, a Texas-based conservative 501(C)(4) organization that champions small government, and a bill that would approve it was introduced in Congress last month by U.S. Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/02/23/the-health-care-compact-fixing-american-health-care-one-state-at-a-time/">an essay written for Forbes magazine</a>, Lankford says that the troubled rollout of the federal government's Affordable Care Act website, and the relatively smooth rollout of state exchange websites, is evidence that the states should be managing the governance of health care.</p>
<p>"Local control works better," Lankford wrote. "The states are listening to the people. It's time for Congress to do the same."</p>
<p>States whose legislatures have voted to participate are Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Indiana. The Kansas legislature is debating the issue, according to <a href="http://www.arkcity.net/news/state_news/article_17544442-aa65-11e3-8e6c-0019bb2963f4.html">a report from the KU Statehouse Wire Service</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The compact would be unenforceable without Congressional approval.</span></p>
