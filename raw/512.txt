  Stocks appear to be shrugging the weekend secession vote in
  Crimea after losing ground last week. The green arrows in the
  pre-market may be reflective of more than just Celtic solidarity
  on St Paddy's Day today, with the Empire State manufacturing
  survey confirming the positive bias. It will be interesting to
  see if the positive sentiment will withstand the industrial
  production and homebuilder sentiment data coming out a little
  later.
  <p>
</p>

  The market will have plenty of domestic economic data to chew on
  this week, with developments in Ukraine and questions about
  China's growth outlook providing an unsettling backdrop. On top
  of today's factory readings, we will get a host of corporate
  earnings, housing, and inflation reports the rest of this
  week.</p>
<p>But the focus will be on the two-day FOMC meeting getting
  underway on Tuesday, particularly Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's
  first press conference.
  <br/>

  ???No surprises are expected from the Fed, particularly on the
  Taper front.</p>
<p>With the unemployment rate not too far from the Fed's 6.5%
  target, they will likely try to move past the explicit threshold
  without roiling the market. This wouldn't be easy, as too vague a
  threshold leaves open the risk that the market gets ahead of the
  Fed in pricing the eventual monetary tightening. The FOMC could
  address this issue in its official statement on Wednesday, but
  the issue is bound to come up in Janet Yellen's press event that
  afternoon.??????</p>
<p>Beyond the Fed and economic data, we have the 2014 Q1 earnings
  season get underway with the

  ) and
  <strong>Oracle</strong>

  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/orcl">ORCL</a>

  ) results after the close on Tuesday. Companies with fiscal
  quarters ending in February get counted as part of our Q1 tally
  and we have a number of other bellwethers like
  <strong>Nike</strong>

  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nke">NKE</a>

  ) and
  <strong>FedEx</strong>

  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fdx">FDX</a>

  ) reporting later this week as well.
  <p>
</p>

  Estimates for 2014 Q1 came down at an accelerated pace as
  companies predominantly guided lower on 2013 Q4 earnings calls,
  consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than a
  year now.
  <p>
</p>

  Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&amp;P 500 are currently
  expected to be down -1.5% from the same period last year, a
  material decline from the +2.1% growth expected in early January
  2014. The negative revision trend is widespread, but is
  particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos,
  Consumer Staples and the Energy sectors.
