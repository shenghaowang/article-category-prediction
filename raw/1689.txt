<p>Steve Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors has renamed itself Point72 Asset Management.</p>
<p>The new name, a reference to the Stamford, Conn., firm’s address at 72 Cummings Point Road, was revealed Tuesday in a memo to employees. The change takes effect next month.</p>
<p>The name change and transfer of employees comes as SAC’s settlement and guilty plea to criminal insider-trading charges goes before a federal judge on April 10, when it may or may not be approved.</p>
<p>“Our two new long/short trading divisions will do business as Point72 Asset Management and EverPoint Asset Management,” SAC President Tom Conheeney wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Post.</p>
<p>A third SAC operation, its multi-quant business, will be called Cubist Systematic Strategies, a nod to Cohen’s status as a major modern art investor.</p>
<p>Conheeney said Cohen and senior management decided the firm’s “path forward” as a family office would be easier under “new legal entities and new names.”</p>
<p>Teams from the soon-to-be-renamed CR Intrinsic, Sigma and SAC — all divisions where insider trading took place — will move to Point72 in Stamford and EverPoint in New York City. Employee transfers are scheduled for April 7. Cohen’s private investments will be managed by Cohen Private Ventures.</p>
<p>As part of the deal SAC struck with US Attorney Preet Bharara, the firm agreed to return all outside investor money, accepted a probationary period of five years and has to pay for an independent compliance consultant.</p>
<p>“We have been through a great deal during the past few years,” the memo concluded. “Our new names, combined with the other changes we have announced, are intended to help us move forward.”</p>
