<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Vodafone Group Monday jump-started its post-Verizon future, but AT&amp;T remains in the wings.</span></p>
<p>The U.K. mobile giant says it is accelerating its plan to be a “unified communications” player following its €7.2 billion ($10 billion) buy of Spain’s cable operator Ono, the first acquisition since Vodafone sold to Verizon Communications its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, the U.S.’s biggest wireless operator, for a landmark $130 billion. But Vodafone itself is targeted.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/03/12/takeover-time-att-winks-at-vodadone-then-winks-harder/">AT&amp;T warned the window for a wireless deal in Europe may be closing</a>. The company has been open about its interest in Europe, and people familiar with the matter say it has explored a bid for Vodafone.</p>
