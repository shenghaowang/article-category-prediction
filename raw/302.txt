<p> The U.S. currency slipped against its European major counterparts in the New York session on Friday, as the the U.S. consumer sentiment index fell more-than-expected in March.</p>
<p>The data from the Reuters/University of Michigan showed that U.S. consumer sentiment index declined to 79.9 in March, versus expectations for a reading of 82. In last month, sentiment rose to 81.6.</p>
<p>The greenback declined to 0.8703 against the franc, just few pips away to pierce yesterday's multi-year low. </p>
<p>Reversing from an early 2-day high of 1.6587 against the pound, the greenback declined to 1.6635 after the data was released. </p>
<p>The greenback fell to 1.3934 against the euro and its further decline from the 1.397 area would lead to lowest level set in 2011. </p>
<p>If the greenback extends slide, it may find support around 0.86 against the franc, 1.675 against the pound and 1.41 against the euro. </p>
