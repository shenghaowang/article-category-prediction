<p>For the first time since it legalized recreational marijuana, Colorado is releasing revenue figures: The state made $3.5 million in taxes and fees in January. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2014/03/10/first-month-of-marijuana-taxes/6257687/">As KUSA-TV reports</a>, $2.1 million of that came from the sale of recreational pot and $1.4 million came from medical marijuana. </p>
<p>KUSA adds:<br/></p>
<p>"The figures from the state Department of Revenue also give a preliminary idea of the size of the marijuana trade in the state, showing $14 million worth of marijuana was sold in the first month of legal sales. </p>
<p>"The report provides the first concrete proof of what pro-marijuana advocates had promised, that growing and selling the drug locally would generate economic activity here rather than sending drug money out-of-state, and that the drug could provide a windfall to the state government. </p>
<p>" 'This is revenue directly out of the hands of cartels,' said Brian Vicente, who helped legalize pot in Colorado. 'These tax numbers will probably grow over time, but since it's a new market, we'll have to wait and see.'"<br/></p>
<p><a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/pm_5027/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=mbJurlF5">The Associated Press reports</a> that the state has 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores. The state imposes two taxes on pot: a 12.9 percent sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax. </p>
<p>"The first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers," the AP reports.<br/></p>
