<p>The European Union’s to-do list isn’t long this week, but anyone interested in financial regulation should get ready for some late nights. The bloc is pushing for a final deal on a new bank-resolution framework for the euro zone and more transparency on foreign bank accounts. The crisis in Ukraine will certainly also occupy minds in Brussels.</p>
<p>On <strong>Monday</strong>, <strong>euro-zone finance ministers meet</strong> for some ordinary business: <strong>Cyprus</strong>, whose third review a year after its bailout was just completed, is expecting a fresh injection of cash to be approved. The money won’t reach the island till April. There had been hopes that <strong>Greece</strong>, too, could get the finance ministers’ backing for a fresh disbursement of aid, but the required work in Athens hasn’t been concluded. Experts from the troika of institutions overseeing the Greek bailout — the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank — will report to ministers and then return to the Greek capital to wrap up their review.</p>
