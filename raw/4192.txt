weak euro zone industrial production data, while market sentiment
remained under pressure amid concerns over an economic slowdown in
China, as well as worries over ongoing turmoil in Ukraine.</p>

0.99%, France's CAC 40 plummeted 1.30%, while Germany's DAX 30
tumbled 1.28%.</p>
<p>Official data showed that industrial production in the euro zone
declined by 0.2% in January, disappointing expectations for a gain
of 0.5%. Industrial production in December was revised to a 0.4%
drop, from a previously reported fall of 0.7%.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Meanwhile, investors remained cautious amid worries over the
outlook for China's economy after data over the weekend showed that
exports dropped 18.1% in February and inflation slowed.</p>
<p>Markets were also eyeing the standoff between Russia and the
West over Ukraine. Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy
Yatsenyuk was to travel to the U.S. to meet President Barack Obama

continued.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, European Central Bank Vice President Vitor

<p>Among peripheral lenders, Intesa Sanpaolo slipped 0.22%, while

respectively.</p>

sending shares down 4.79%.</p>
<p>On the upside, Adecco SA surged 5.05% after reporting full-year
earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>In London, as commodity-heavy FTSE 100 retreated 0.99%, led by
G4S Plc, down 4.20%, after the company reported lower-than-forecast
quarterly results.</p>

respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.K. lenders continued to track their European
counterparts broadly lower. Lloyds Banking tumbled 1.12% and
Barclays dropped 1.46%, while HSBC Holdings retreated 1.45% and the

<p>In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a lower open. The Dow
