<p>U.S. stocks are little changed in midday trading as investors worry about slower growth in China and lingering tensions in Ukraine.</p>
<p>KEEPING SCORE: The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index edged down a point to 1,866 as of noon Wednesday. It was down as much as 13 points earlier.The Dow Jones industrial average fell four points to 16,346. The Nasdaq composite rose eight points to 4,315. Seven of the 10 industry sectors in the S&amp;P 500 index fell.</p>
<p>CHINA IN SPOTLIGHT: The catalyst for the latest market downturn was news this week that Chinese exports slumped in February. Since China is a big consumer of raw materials and energy, commodities such as copper and iron ore have dropped sharply. Copper has fallen to its lowest level since 2010.</p>
<p>''We've been seeing these periodic, occasional weak data points come out of China,'' said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''And each time that happens when our markets are at all-time record highs, they're going to be very sensitive to any sort of negative news and there'll be days of profit-taking.''</p>
<p>SECTOR VIEW: Eight of the 10 industry sectors in the S&amp;P 500 index fell, with utilities and energy bucking the trend. Among the S&amp;P 500 index's big decliners were insurer Progressive, which shed 62 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $23.90, and homebuilder PulteGroup, which slid 43 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $19.50 following a report that applications for home loans declined from a week ago.</p>

<p>DRUG CONCERNS: Geron plunged $2.83, or 64.2 percent, to $1.58 in morning trading. Concerns about potential liver damage prompted U.S. federal regulators to order research suspended on its blood disorder drug.</p>
<p>EUROPE: Germany's DAX fell 1.5 percent, the CAC-40 in France fell 1.4 percent and Britain's FT-SE lost 1 percent.</p>
