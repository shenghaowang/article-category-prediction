<p>What’s the difference between pork bellies and bitcoins? Nothing, says Goldman Sachs. They pooh-pooh the notion of bitcoin as currency and instead classify it as a speculative asset that rises and falls based on the madness of the crowd. The Satoshi Nakamoto story continues to amuse/intrigue and, as someone said, there’s got to be a rose ceremony in there somewhere. Lord and Taylor now accepts bitcoins and New York is trying to become the “Delaware” of Bitcoin by trying its very best to create an attractive regulatory environment. Oh, and we’ll have not one, but two, panels at The Innovation Project 2014 focused on Bitcoin with some of the movers and shakers of the Bitcoin world at the mike.</p>

<p><strong>On the Plus Side …</strong></p>
<p>“Can I put that on your Bitcoin account?” Words to be spoken now by sales associates at Lord &amp; Taylor, which has agreed to accept bitcoins for payment. And the crazy miners are gearing up and revving up for lots of action – as in $20 million a month. We’d hate to pay their electricity bills.</p>
<p><strong>On the Dark Side …</strong></p>
<p>Goldman Sachs carries a lot of weight in this industry, and it released its opinion that digital currencies are not a currency, but rather a speculative asset whose value is unstable and given to the whims of the speculators – like oil, pork bellies and other commodities.  And more than one article has been written to suggest that Bitcoin is the most elegant and clever “Ponzi Scheme” ever created.</p>
