<p class="speakable-paragraph">Last week was another week where four out of five major equity averages achieved new all-time or multiyear intraday highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (1,6452.72) was the exception still lagging its all-time high at 1,6588.25 on Dec. 31.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 (1,878.04) and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (7,592.36) set new all-time intraday highs at 1883.57 and 7627.44 respectively on Friday.</p>
<p>As U.S. Treasury yields rose last week, the Dow Utility Average (514.39) lost its leadership slipping into second place year-to-date with a gain of 4.8% down from 5.7% the prior week. The 2014 leader among the averages and indices I follow is now the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) (574.39) up 7.4% on the year setting a new multiyear intraday high at 577.64 on Friday.</p>
<p>In this market environment there were five trades last week in the premium <em><a data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.newsletters.forbes.com/store?Action=DisplayPage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;id=ProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=es_764&amp;productID=222665900&amp;pgm=76605300" href="http://www.newsletters.forbes.com/store?Action=DisplayPage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;id=ProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=es_764&amp;productID=222665900&amp;pgm=76605300" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ValuTrader Model Portfolio</a></em> advisory. The long-side of the model portfolio was reduced to 13 long positions in 7 stocks, four being components of the Dow Industrial Average. Two stocks on this week’s ValuTrader Watch List are also Dow components.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of last week’s trades:</p>
<p><b>
<fbs-quotecard article-quote-card="" closing-price="2.85" current-price="2.93" exchange="NYSE" link="/companies/kinross-gold/" name="Kinross Gold" natural-id="fred/company/2460" ticker="KGC" type="organization">
<a data-ga-track="InternalLink:/companies/kinross-gold/" href="/companies/kinross-gold/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_self">Kinross Gold</a>
</fbs-quotecard> </b>was removed from the model portfolio last Monday, March 3 on a good 'til canceled (GTC) limit order to sell strength to my weekly risky level at $5.31. The open that day was $5.36 where the exit price was set for a gain of 19.1%. This proved to be a prudent exit as the stock ended the week at $4.89. This stock could not sustain gains above its 200-day simple moving average at $5.08 and its 50-day SMA is $4.78.</p>

</fbs-quotecard> </b>continues to be actively traded by my methodology. On January 28 a second position in this stock was removed from the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to sell strength to $19.67 for a gain of 7.7%. This position re-entered the model portfolio on a GTC limit order to buy weakness to my annual value level at $18.84 on March 3.</p>
<p>The stock still has a buy rating according to ValuEngine with a one-year price target at $20.41. This week’s value level is $18.54 with an annual pivot at $18.84, an annual pivot at $20.72 and monthly risky level at $23.41. Cirrus is above its 50-day SMA at $19.08 but below its 200-day SMA at $20.19. The weekly chart is positive with Friday’s close above its five-week modified moving average at $19.00 with its 200-week SMA at $21.46.</p>
<p>Our string of winning trades that go back to mid-September came to an end last week when <b>Big Lots (BIG) </b>and <b>Coca Cola (KO) </b>were removed from the model portfolio due to downgrades to hold from buy according to ValuEngine. Subscribers were sent a ValuTrader Alert via email on March 4. The two positions in Big Lots lost 3.3% and 3.4%, and the two positions in Coca Cola lost 2.4% and $2.2%.</p>
<p>We also learned last week that a bull market does not lift all stocks. On Thursday, March 6 we added a second position in <b>
<fbs-quotecard article-quote-card="" closing-price="0.0" current-price="0.0" exchange="NASDAQ" link="/companies/staples/" name="Staples" natural-id="fred/company/4061" ticker="SPLS" type="organization">

</fbs-quotecard> </b>on a GTC limit order to buy weakness to my weekly value level at $11.24. Our first position ended last week with a mark-to-market loss of 21%. Staples still has a buy rating according to ValuEngine and is now 30% undervalued. This week’s value level is $10.77 with a monthly risky level at $13.79. On March 6 before the opening bell Staples reported a 10.6% quarterly decline in sales and as a result would close 225 stores. The stock gapped lower setting a new 52-week intraday low at $11.16.</p>
<p>At the end of last week our longs have a mark-to-market loss of 1.9% and our closed positions have a gain of 4.1%<span style="color: #000000"> with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.6%.</span><b></b></p>
