<p>Welcome to the Asia Markets live blog, a running account of what the region’s stock markets are doing, along with other news. Shares are trading mixed today, with Tokyo rebounding from its Monday loss. And with no action from the Bank of Japan, the markets are more focused on comments from China\’s central-bank governor and a sharp drop in Chinese lending.</p>
<p>In a turbulent sea of global stock markets worried about the weak Chinese trade data, Australia’s benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 is managing to keep its head above water — currently trading 0.1% higher —  buoyed by some strength in the banks and insurers.</p>
<p>Of the Big Four lenders, ANZ and NAB are flat, but CBA and Westpac are both up 0.2%. Meanwhile, Macquarie is 0.2% higher, and Suncorp is up 0.9%, while QBE Insurance and IAG are up 0.5% apiece.</p>
<p>But miners are down, and in some cases down a lot. This, as copper languishes at eight-month lows and, more importantly, spot iron ore saw its biggest drop in four years as investors worried about Chinese demand.</p>
<p>As Rivkin CEO Scott Schuberg puts it in his daily premarket note: “Unlike copper, this market [iron ore] has broken down through recent lows, and we can only sit back and watch as the iron-ore price finds its new home.”</p>
<p>And so, it’s a 2.2% loss for Fortescue Metals and a 2.7% fall for Atlas Iron, though both are off their opening lows. (Atlas was off more than 5% at one point.)</p>
<p>Among other mining-sector casualties, Whitehaven Coal is down 3.1%, and in the gold space, Evolution is down 1.1% and Kingsgate is down 0.8%.</p>
<p>Also on the decline, aluminum-vessel maker Austal is trading 2.8% lower, even after it announced a $684 million contract with the U.S. Navy. On the other hand, Bluescope Steel is up 1%, getting some support from a weaker Australian dollar.</p>
<p>In about an hour, watch for NAB’s monthly business survey, which could, just maybe, move shares.</p>
<p>Late Monday, the People’s Bank of China handed out its data for February bank lending and “total social financing” (or “TSF,” which includes all credit issuance), and the numbers were way, way down from January.</p>
<p>Specifically, TSF was 63% lower than January’s all-time high, with Bernstein Research putting the result 27% below market expectations.</p>
<p>Bernstein says some of the pullback is due to fear after China Credit Trust <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-trust-lender-will-avert-default-reports-2014-01-27">came just short of a bond default</a> on its unfortunately named “Credit Equals Gold” debt product late in January. While that security was saved from default, we have of course seen <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/05/shanghai-chaori-solar-firm-on-brink-of-becoming-chinas-first-bond-default/">a real default from Chaori Solar this month</a>.</p>
<p>And then there’s the seasonal factor: Loans usually surge in January, and with Lunar New Year falling on Jan. 31 this year, Bernstein says that some lending was front-loaded into the pre-holiday season.</p>
<p>Actually, it seems that with all data out this month, economists are quick to blame the calendar. I guess we’ll find out how valid this is when numbers for March come out next month.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) up 0.7%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) flat <br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.2%</p>
<p>Almost no one thinks the Bank of Japan will offer any new easing in its decision later today, but the Tokyo market doesn’t seem to need any help this morning, with the Nikkei Average up more than 0.6% at 15,211.04. The Topix too is up 0.6%.</p>
<p>As mentioned in yesterday’s Asia Markets blog, the Japanese central bank is expected to keep both its policy and economic assessment unchanged, with analysts from Brown Brothers Harriman saying the BOJ is in “wait and see mode,” with additional easing unlikely until the third quarter.</p>
<p>“This will allow officials time to assess the impact of the retail-sales-tax increase and the ongoing efforts to bolster inflation,” the note said, referring to April’s planned hike in the national consumption tax.</p>
<p>Among the gainers, wireless major Softbank advanced 1.3%, after the company’s CEO Masayoshi Son said he is still eager to see Softbank’s Sprint subsidiary buy T-Mobile US, according to reported comments from a Charlie Rose interview. Son is in Washington to seek support for such a deal.</p>
<p>Steel stocks also advanced, helped by ratings upgrades and a tumble in iron-ore prices. Aichi Steel shot 4.4% higher, and Daido Steel gained 2.3%, after Credit Suisse upgraded the two stocks’ ratings to neutral.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) up 0.9%<br/>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.1%<br/>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.2%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) up 0.1%<br/>Seoul (Kospi) down 0.1%<br/>Taipei (Taiex) up 0.3%</p>
<p>Investors seem reluctant to come back to Chinese markets this morning after yesterday’s bout of panic selling.</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is edging up 0.1% after losing 1.8% the previous day, while the Shanghai Composite Index is down another 0.3% after tumbling 2.9% Monday. </p>
<p>The two indexes saw heavy selling yesterday as the seemingly terrible trade data stoked fear that the Chinese economy is losing steam. (<a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/09/asia-markets-live-blog-stocks-face-china-trade-jitters/">See yesterday’s Asia Markets blog</a>.)</p>
<p>Chinese insurers were among the decliners, as mystery still surrounds the fate of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared Saturday on its way to Beijing with 239 people on board. PICC Property &amp; Casualty Co. declined 1%, Ping An Insurance fell 0.8%, and China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. dropped 0.5%.</p>
<p>Mainland banks gained a little ground though, after the central bank Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan said Tuesday morning that he expects China to lift its controls on banks’ interest rates in one to two years. China Citic Bank Corp. and China Minsheng Banking Corp. advanced 1.2% each, and Bank of China rose 1%.</p>
<p>There are few surprises in the Bank of Japan decision today — no changes to policy, nor any changes to the broad economic assessment (“Japan’s economy has continued to recover moderately” etc. etc.)</p>
<p>They did add a sentence to the statement saying “Exports have recently leveled off more or less.”</p>
<p>And the part about business’s fixed investment was altered to “the pick-up … has become increasingly evident” from last month’s “has been picking up.” (At least this is how the English version of the statement changed — <a href="https://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2014/k140311a.pdf">you can read it all here</a>.)</p>
<p>But for the most part, not much to report, just as the market expected.</p>
<p>All the same, there might have been some speculation for a surprise, as the dollar slipped against the yen after the decision came down. The greenback is currently buying ¥103.29 compared to ¥103.40 as the “news” broke. </p>
<p>More to the point: When will the Bank of Japan make its next move?</p>
<p>Many research houses think the central bank won’t rush into fresh easing right after the consumption-tax hike, set for next month. <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/09/asia-markets-live-blog-stocks-face-china-trade-jitters/">As reported in yesterday’s Asia Markets blog</a>, Capital Economics sees “late October as the most likely timing.”</p>
<p>Société Générale, on the other hand, is calling for BOJ action “within the next few months.”</p>
<p>“The case for further easing has just been strengthened by a disappointing Q4 GDP report,” they wrote Tuesday, in reference to the downwardly revised annualized growth rate of 0.7% (also reported in yesterday’s blog).</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) up 0.7% (at break)<br/>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.2%<br/>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.3%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) up 0.3%<br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.1%<br/>Taipei (Taiex) up 0.3%</p>
<p>How quick will China’s financial reforms happen? The answer might have become a little clearer today, at least in terms of long-awaited interest rate liberalization.</p>
<p>China’s central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan says he sees full rate reform within the next couple years, making it clear this would be the “final step” in the liberalization process.</p>
<p>But then again, maybe market-driven rates are already here, hiding in plain sight on the Internet. <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/11/china-to-throw-rates-to-the-market-soon-with-big-thanks-to-the-internet/">You can read the details in this blog post</a>…</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) up 0.7%<br/>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.1%<br/>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) down 0.1%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) flat (closed)<br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.2%<br/>Mumbai (Sensex) down 0.3%</p>
<p>Just to mention, the initial public offering of Japan Display, which priced yesterday, may in fact be Asia’s biggest tech IPO ever.</p>
<p>According to Dealogic, the offering priced at $3.1 billion, making it the world’s biggest in the tech arena since Facebook’s $16 billion listing in May 2012.</p>
<p>In terms of other Asian tech offerings, it blows away the previous No. 1, SMIC’s $1.8 billion listing back in March 2004, not to mention Alibaba’s $1.7 billion IPO in October 2007, per Dealogic data.</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s the largest Japanese IPO in any sector since Suntory came to market last June for $4 billion.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) up 0.7% at 15,224.11 (closed)</p>
<p>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) up 0.02% at 22,269.61 (closed)</p>
<p>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.1% at 2,001.16 (closed)</p>
<p>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) up 0.04% at 5,413.80 (closed)</p>
<p>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.5% at 1,963.87  (closed)</p>
