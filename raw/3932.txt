<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Colorado made roughly $2 million in 
marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in 
the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates 
$14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The state collected 
roughly $2.01 million in taxes.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana 
didn't begin until January. <br/></font></p>

<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent 
excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared 
that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school 
construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, 
though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local 
governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if 
they wish.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should 
spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana 
industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers 
nervous about how to spend the windfall.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed 
$134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana 
money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more 
advertising discouraging driving while high.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">"The whole world wants to belly up to this trough," said Sen. Pat 
Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado's budget-writing 
Joint Budget Committee.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's 
first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has
 legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. 
Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Colorado's pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state's 
unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax 
increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the 
figure posed to voters. Last year's pot vote guessed that the taxes 
would produce $70 million a year, and it's not clear what lawmakers can 
do with tax money that exceeds that figure.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Colorado's JBC plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">"There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue
 from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don't think it's 
going to be that simple," said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and
 another JBC member.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Colorado's 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.</font></p>
