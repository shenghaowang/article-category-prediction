<p data-page="1">Is Quizno's toast?</p>
<p>The now-troubled sandwich chain - known for its oven-toasted subs - filed for pre-packaged bankruptcy protection Friday, citing tough competition in the fast food arena.</p>
<p>Other casual eateries like Subway, Chipotle, and Panera have been chomping into Quizno's business in the past several years, as newer competitors like Potbelly have entered the fast-food arena, offering toasted sandwiches at a more palatable cost to cash-strapped customers.</p>
<p>A turkey sandwich at Potbelly Sandwich Shop costs around $5.50, while a regular Quizno's Pesto Caesar Chicken sub costs $6.29.</p>
<p>The Denver-based company said in its bankruptcy petition that it has between $500 million and $1 billion of liabilities. The company's CEO, Stuart Mathis, said Quizno's plans on restructuring by "reducing food costs (and) implementing a franchise owner rebate program."</p>
<p>The company will also seek to secure a $15 million loan from senior lenders to continue business-as-usual.</p>
<p>Quizno's isn't the only fast food eatery to fall on hard times this week. Days earlier, fraught pizza chain Sbarro LLC filed for its second bankruptcy in three years.</p>
