<p><p><strong>Beijing:</strong> Amid growing tensions with its neighbours over territorial disputes, Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said China has an unshakable will to safeguard its sovereignty but at the same time would enhance common interests and narrow differences with neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>"China has unwavering commitment to pursuing peaceful development and unshakable will in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, both for the sake of upholding stability and creating a favourable environment for its development," Li said addressing a press conference at the end of the annual parliamentary session ended.</p>
<p>"When neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another," Li said.</p>
<p>"As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises," he said responding to a question on his visits to several neighbouring countries after he took power last year.</p>
<p>Li visited India first to show the importance Chinese leadership attached to bilateral relations followed by Pakistan and other countries.</p>
<p>His visit was reciprocated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh making 2013 a rare year when premiers of both countries visited each other in the same year.</p>
