<p>It is easy to get carried away by this long-awaited stock market listing.</p>
<p>Yes, here is a technology success that has Made in Britain written all over it. Yes, based on these numbers, it will crystallise untold wealth for developers who have toiled away in the capital — a reminder that this is a Tech City now to rival anywhere in the world with the exception of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>But what a shame that King.com’s backers did not see fit to test the waters of the London market and instead have headed to New York to raise cash.</p>
<p>And then there is the valuation. Candy Crush has been a phenomenon, but King will be lucky if any of the other games in its portfolio turn into such huge hits</p>
<p>To allude to another online game, Angry Birds, here is a company with all its eggs in one basket. It will have to work extremely hard to match these lofty expectations.</p>
