<p>Starbucks' updated app allows mobile users to tip their baristas directly via iPhone. </p>
<p><a href="http://news.starbucks.com/news/starbucks-accelerates-mobile-payment-leadership-with-release-of-enhanced-io" target="_blank">Starbucks has announced</a> an update to the <a href="http://sbux.co/StarbucksforiPhone" target="_blank">Starbucks App for iPhone</a> that will allow customers to tip their baristas directly through the app. Beginning March 19, customers with the app will be able to leave their barista a tip of $.50, $1.00, or $2.00. The update, which will include a “shake to pay” feature and a more streamlined design, is a response to customers’ growing preference for mobile payment options.</p>
<p>“With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we’re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,” said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks.</p>
<p>Starbucks noted that digital tipping has long been a popular suggestion on <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/learn-more/my-starbucks-idea" target="_blank">MyStarbucksIdea.com</a>, where customers offer suggestions to improve service.</p>
<p>“As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have also asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to store partners,” said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S., Americas and Teavana. “We’re proud to offer digital tipping as an option through the updated Starbucks for iPhone app for customers in the U.S.”</p>
