<p>British mobile phone giant Vodafone has agreed to buy Spanish cable television and internet provider Ono for 7.2 billion euros, or $10 billion, it said on Monday.<br/><br/>Vodafone, flush with cash from the sale of its US joint-venture stake to partner Verizon for $130 billion, said the Ono deal was a "significant opportunity" to create Spain's top integrated services provider.<br/><br/>"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said in a statement.<br/><br/>"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ... will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market," he said.<br/><br/>"We look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain."<br/><br/>The transaction, worth the equivalent of 6 billion Great Britain pounds, is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year but remains subject to regulatory approval.<br/><br/>Ono, which has about 1.9 million customers, has struggled to compete in Spain with Telefonica, Jazztel and other firms that bundle in-home services.<br/><br/><div id="checked" style="display: none"><div id="adslotNativeVideo" style="text-align:center; padding-bottom:20px;"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("adslotNativeVideo"); });</script></div></div>Vodafone meanwhile has about 14 million customers in Spain, but faces fierce competition.<br/><br/>"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of the Ono board of directors, in Monday's statement.<br/><br/>"As part of Vodafone, Ono will continue to seize new growth opportunities and deliver the quality that our customers expect," he said.<br/><br/>"The enlarged business is also expected to drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry."<br/><br/><a class="showFilePanel" href="javascript:void(0);"><div class="comment_story"><span><em class="ndtv-detailp-comments-count"></em></span></div></a>The statement, meanwhile, followed weekend media reports that Vodafone had reached a deal.</p>
