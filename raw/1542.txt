<p> DUBLIN — Yes, they have more bananas. </p>
<p> Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world”s biggest banana supplier. </p>
<p> The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base. </p>
<p> The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations. </p>
<p> Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p> The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world”s No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons. </p>
<p> Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday”s deal valued Fyffes shares at $1.66. </p>
<p> Fyffes rose 46 percent to $1.80 on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York. </p>
<p> Fyffes, pronounced “Fifes,” is Europe”s biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company”s presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize. </p>
<p> David McCann, Fyffes” chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman. </p>
<p> Lonergan said their “natural strategic partnership” would “provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.” </p>
<p> However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren”t expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate. </p>
