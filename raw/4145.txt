<p>The Japanese-based bitcoin exchange has <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mt-gox-files-for-chapter-15-in-us-2014-03-10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filed bankruptcy papers</a> in the US following a similar move in Japan last month.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US having filed a similar application in Japan on 28 February. The particular chapter of bankruptcy protection sought deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.</p>
<p>The move is just the latest move in the unfolding story of what was once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, handling up to 80% of all trades at one point in 2013.</p>
<p>On 28 February the exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles <a href="/bitcoin-exchange-mtgox-files-bankruptcy-1438301" target="_blank">filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo</a> claiming that 850,000 bitcoins (at the time worth around Â£240 million) had been stolen from the exchange, 100,000 which belonged to the company and 750,000 belonging to the customers.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 protection in the US was introduced back in 1997 and is almost entirely based on the UN Model Law which aims to modernise and harmonise cross-border insolvencies around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Some relief</strong></p>
<p>If granted it would provide some relief for Mt. Gox, including the granting of an "automatic stay" preventing creditors seizing its US assets.</p>
<p>A company files for bankruptcy protection if it believes it can recover financially, given time and some amount of restructuring and reorganisation - this could include a change of management, business model or the selling of a highly-value assets such as buildings (which could be leased back from the buyer) or vehicles.</p>
<p>When a company files for bankruptcy outright, it has accepted that it is no longer able to repay its creditors and any steps for recovery are impossible.</p>
<p>The latest move in Mt. Gox's story comes after <a href="/mt-gox-hackers-claim-ceo-mark-karpeles-lied-about-bitcoin-balance-1439562" target="_blank">hackers claim to have stolen transaction logs </a>from the exchange which they published on Karpeles' personal blog over the weekend. The hackers claim the under-fire CEO was lying about the amount of bitcoins the exchange had leading to many users of Mt. Gox to claim Karpeles had stolen their bitcoins.</p>
