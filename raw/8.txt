<p>Even as tensions in Ukraine ease with Russian President
  Vladimir Putin asserting that military intervention is not on the
  cards and force will be used only as a last resort, the
  confrontation between Moscow and the West - the most serious
  since the end of the Cold War - has captivated world energy
  markets.

  Russia's bloodless seizure of border posts in Ukraine's Crimean
  Peninsula threatens to derail hydrocarbon deliveries bound for
  Europe. In particular, with about a third of the continent's
  natural gas supply coming from Russia - most of it via pipelines
  passing through Ukraine - any escalation of the conflict there
  will severely disrupt natural gas availability to downstream
  customers in Europe, sending prices soaring.
  <br/>
<br/>

  Following two prior supply cuts in 2006 and 2009 and a possible
  third anytime, Europe is on the lookout for other sources that
  can reduce its dependence on Russian gas. The most viable
  alternative seems to be the U.S., which, thanks to the shale
  revolution, is flush with the
  commodity.         
  <br/>

  With the success of 'shale gas' - the kind trapped within dense
  sedimentary rock formations or shale formations - and the advent
  of sophisticated drilling techniques, natural gas is now
  available in abundance, while domestic prices have fallen by two
  thirds. This gives the U.S. leeway to export some of the excess
  and cheap gas through sea - in the form of liquefied natural gas
  (LNG) - to the European markets.
  <br/>
<br/>

  Let's look at some companies that are likely to benefit a great
  deal from the growth and development of the LNG markets.
  <br/>
<br/>

  Houston, Texas-based
  <strong>Cheniere Energy Inc.</strong>

  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/lng">LNG</a>

  ) is the first name that comes to mind. The only Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission/FERC -approved operator in this space with
  the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in
  Cameron Parish, Louisiana, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has
  got the first mover advantage. Cheniere is expected to witness
  earnings growth of 14% in 2014 and 33% in 2015, when first
  commercial production from the Sabine Pass facility is expected.
  <br/>
<br/>

  While Cheniere Energy is clearly ahead of the pack when it comes
  to natural gas export, there are certain other players that are
  in line to get federal approval for their terminals. These
  include
  <strong>Dominion Resources Inc</strong>

  's (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/d">D</a>

  ) Cove Point facility in Maryland,
  <strong>Sempra Energy</strong>

  's (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/sre">SRE</a>

  ) Cameron terminal in Louisiana and
  <strong>Energy Transfer Equity L.P.</strong>

  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ete">ETE</a>

  )/BG Group Plc's Lake Charles facility, also in Louisiana.
  <br/>
<br/>

  As natural gas production in the U.S. soars, domestic prices
  remain constrained, and the Obama administration speeds up LNG
  approvals, more and more companies will be eyeing European
  markets through export. Importantly, this will loosen Russia's
  energy squeeze on Europe and provide the region with long-term
  energy security.</p>
