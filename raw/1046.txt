<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Stocks are mostly lower in the early going, with the S&amp;P 500 pulling back from <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-mostly-rise-nasdaq-slips-into-red-2014-03-07">Friday’s record close</a>.</p>
<p>Reports of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-trade-data-weakens-asian-shares-2014-03-10">weaker-than-expected Chinese exports</a> are getting much of the blame. <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-trade-data-weakens-asian-shares-2014-03-10">Equities in Asia closed sharply lower today</a>.</p>
<p>SPX -4 points</p>

<p>Boeing <span class="quotePeekContainer"> <span class="quotepeekbase bgQuote neutral" id="quoteeb28d7ef234301a3371720ea0d790df1a9c4363a"> <a href="http://marketwatch.com/investing/stock/BA"> <span class="bgChannel">/quotes/zigman/220026/delayed</span> <span class="bgRealtimeChannel">/quotes/nls/ba</span> <span class="symbol">BA</span> </a> </span> </span> is helping push the Dow lower.</p>
<p>It’s the worst-performing Dow component so far today, last down about 2%.  There’s been more trouble for the aircraft maker’s 787 — news of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-to-inspect-787-dreamliner-wings-for-cracks-2014-03-07">cracks in the wings of some planes</a>.</p>

<p>Another Dow component with news today is McDonald’s<span class="quotePeekContainer"> <span class="quotepeekbase bgQuote neutral" id="quote283957109cfcd0914c8ff8165fb477717d8d36c6"> <a href="http://marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MCD"> <span class="bgChannel">/quotes/zigman/233369/delayed</span> <span class="bgRealtimeChannel">/quotes/nls/mcd</span> <span class="symbol">MCD</span> </a> </span> </span>, which reported a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mcdonalds-feb-global-same-store-sales-drop-03-2014-03-10">global drop in monthly same-store sales</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. sales were down 1.4%. Dow Jones Market Talk emphasized the domestic decline follows drops in December and January, and these performances are “concerning of course since the US remains far and away MCD’s biggest market.”</p>
<p>Shares in McDonald’s were last down 0.3% — not a big drop, but still a drop.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 has picked itself up off its session low, but it’s still in negative territory. The benchmark index was last down 0.1%.</p>
<p>The Dow fell out of the gate and has basically moved sideways. The blue-chip index was down 0.3% at last check.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq has been dancing around the break-even mark, at times showing small gains, at times showing small losses. The tech-heavy index was last up 0.1%.</p>
<p>While the S&amp;P 500 eked out another record close on Friday, Colin Cieszynski doesn’t sound impressed.</p>
<p>The senior analyst at CMC Markets apparently would have preferred a finish above 1,880.</p>
<p>He writes in a note today:</p>
<p>“SPX500 failed to hold a new high Friday above 1,880 and continues to roll over today. A negative RSI divergence suggests uptrend weakening. Initial support appears in the 1,850 to 1,855 previous resistance zone followed by 1,830.”</p>
<p>In his note this morning, CMC’s Cieszynski also has an interesting take on McDonald’s<span class="quotePeekContainer"> <span class="quotepeekbase bgQuote neutral" id="quote283957109cfcd0914c8ff8165fb477717d8d36c6"> <a href="http://marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MCD"> <span class="bgChannel">/quotes/zigman/233369/delayed</span> <span class="bgRealtimeChannel">/quotes/nls/mcd</span> <span class="symbol">MCD</span> </a> </span> </span> same-store sales falling 0.3% for February.</p>
<p>The news “can be seen as a potentially positive indicator for the global economy,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Just as more people tend to eat at McDonalds in recessions, the same people may elect to eat at more expensive restaurants when they have more money or feel more secure about the economy,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>Stocks are at fresh session lows, really retreating after last week’s gains.</p>
<p>Weaker-than-expected data from China did not help this morning, after the official report showed a surprise drop in exports last month. Some analysts says data might be distorted by the celebration of Lunar New Year, however. </p>
<p>Ongoing tension between Ukraine and Russia is also weighing on risky assets – as gold and Treasurys are gaining, while oil and equity markets are falling.</p>

<p>A bright spot amid general gloom is the stock of Plug Power Inc, up 14% at last check. That gain is on top of a 77%  gain last week.  You can read more in this <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-shares-up-12-extend-77-weekly-rise-2014-03-10">short news story.</a></p>
<p>The ongoing war of words between activist investor Carl Icahn and eBay Inc. got more personal on Monday as both sides wasted little time climbing back into the ring after the weekend, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebay-and-icahn-keep-trading-punches-2014-03-10">writes MarketWatch’s Rex Crum</a>.</p>
<p>Shares in eBay fell 1.1% on Monday, but they are up 6.5% year-to-date.</p>
<p>As the S&amp;P 500 index notched up another record high last Friday, margin debt levels hit new highs, prompting analysts to warn investors.</p>
<p>MarketWatch’s Wallace Witkowski writes about high <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-caution-urged-as-margin-debt-levels-hit-new-highs-2014-03-09">margin debt levels and P/E valuations.</a></p>
<p>Another story on valuations is in this <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/10/stock-markets-frothy-valuations-are-still-far-from-tech-boom-extremes/">Tell post by William Watts</a>. </p>
<p>So with the bull market <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-this-stock-bull-market-needs-to-live-a-6th-year-2014-03-06">celebrating its five-year anniversary</a> and the S&amp;P 500 back at record levels, just how pricey are stocks?</p>
<p>It depends how you look at it. Using Thursday’s S&amp;P 500 close at 1,877.03 and a forward 12-month earnings-per-share estimate of $121.86, the forward 12-month price/earnings, or P/E, ratio for the index stood at 15.4, according to data provider FactSet.</p>
<p> John De Clue, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management,  told MarketWatch that the rise in the S&amp;P 500 over the past few weeks was due to multiple expansion. </p>

<p>MarketWatch’s Barbara Kollmeyer describes <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/10/icahnopoly-where-apple-is-boardwalk-and-no-one-goes-to-jail/">the game in her Tell post</a>:</p>
<p>Serious Monopoly players can be found over at <a href="http://marvingardens.forumotion.com/t7-different-strategies-for-winning-at-monopoly">Marvins Gardens.forumotion.com</a> exchanging winning strategies. But when it comes to Icahnopoly, perhaps this is the only tip potential players really need:</p>
<p>“Show no mercy, if a player is down, eliminate him from the game. Luck plays too big a role in Monopoly to risk a comeback.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stocks are off their session lows, but still firmly in negative territory. </p>

</span> is the top gainer on the S&amp;P 500 today. The stock rose 6.7% after the biopharmaceutical company boosted its 2014 adjusted earnings outlook. </p>
<p>It also announced a <a data-ls-seen="1" href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/03/10/alexion-bucks-tide-gains-on-deal-with-france-for-blood-disorder-treatment/">reimbursement deal with the French government</a> on its blood disorder medication that will result in additional sales of $88 million.</p>
<p>The stock has gained nearly 35% since the start of the year and nearly doubled in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 has already cruised past Deutsche Bank’s year-end forecast of 1,850 and may have further to go, writes top strategist David Bianco in a Monday note. But the firm now expects the next 5%-plus move by stocks to be down, he says.</p>
<p>In part, that’s because Deutsche Bank is worried by high price-to-earnings ratio, a continuing trend of earnings forecast downgrades and a lack of “higher quality” drivers for earnings per share and the price/equity ratio. Bianco would prefer to see EPS and P/E driven by increased capital expenditure and export growth as opposed to share buybacks.

<p>The bull market’s fifth anniversary prompted many strategist reassess market conditions and valuations.</p>
<p>Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial, in a research note, writes that margin debt is in elevated territory and and the conditions may be appropriate for a correction.</p>
<p>Margin debt is important for several reasons. First, available and cheap financing allows investors to buy more, which, in a virtuous circle, can lead to more demand and higher prices. If, however, prices start to decline, the debt still has to be repaid. So investors sell to raise cash, which pushes prices down, and so on. Debt raises the possibility of a downward spiral, and can make a spiral more severe when it happens.</p>
<p>The other reason margin debt is important is it reflects investors’ attitude toward risk. By taking on more debt, investors are showing they expect stocks to rise and do not believe risks are that high—which lasts until the market turns. Just as with debt, the change in sentiment can drive prices down even faster than they rose.</p>
<p>I will write next week about indicators that can actually show when to worry about the market in the short term, but the level of margin debt is not one of them. It is, however, an indicator you should keep an eye on in the medium and longer term.</p>
<p>This year it is supposed to be all about U.S. economic growth, but investors and economists had to adjust their expectations after weak readings from pretty much all government reports in the past few months.</p>
<p>The White House’s economic team expects the economy to improve and the main reason behind it is household deleveraging.
