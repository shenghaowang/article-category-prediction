</div>China's Head of Government emphasized that “it is essential to clarify the causes” of the incident and “find the missing airliner of the Malaysian Airlines”.</p>
<p>“China has activated a comprehensive emergency mechanism for the search-and-rescue operation,” Li Keqiang said. “There are now eight Chinese ships in the search zone and another one is heading for a respective area.”</p>
<p>Li Keqiang said he had spoken to the commander of one of the ships on Wednesday and called on him “to make every effort” towards finding the missing airliner. He pointed out that Chinese satellites had spotted suspicious objects floating on the surface of water and that work to identify them was under way. “We are looking forward to news,” Li Keqiang pointed out.</p>
<p>China is also using ten satellites in the search for the missing Boeing airliner. Local media, referring to China's Committee for Defense Science, Technology, and Industry, reported Wednesday that Gaofen-1 high-resolution satellite for remote sensing of the Earth on March 9 had spotted three objects floating on the surface of the South China Sea in the search area.</p>
