<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Next time someone criticises you for playing too much Candy Crush, you can tell them you’re actually solving a complex mathematical problem. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Australian researcher Toby Walsh wanted to test whether the game was what’s called NP-hard - or difficult to solve without a computer. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and was able to turn it into a logical math puzzle - meaning the strategy could be classified alongside other complex problems, confirming it is NP. <br/></font></p>

<p class="imageCaption">Australian Toby Walsh wanted to test whether Candy Crush was NP-complete, or difficult to solve without a computer. To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and turned it into a logic puzzle. The high number of possible outcomes he uncovered proves the games complexity</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Put simply, if a starting board of 
candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player 
has to decide which row to complete first. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Once they have selected this row, it sets off a chain reaction and directly influences which candies fall where as the game continues. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Once
 the game is solved, the player would need to start again, but this time 
choose the other row option, to determine which route scored the highest 
points. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">To make an 
informed, mathematical decision about which row to choose, however, 
requires knowing what candies will appear once the row has been 
completed. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Each time candies fall, they create a number of new row options, increasing the number of possible outcomes. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">To
 check the best score, the player would have to go back over each 
possible outcome, and the rows that follow - producing a puzzle that 
can’t be solved manually.</font> <br/></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Candy Crush Saga is a hugely popular game in which players move different coloured candies around a board to create lines of three in a row. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Once a line of three matching candies is completed, they disappear and candies drop from the top of the screen to fill the gaps. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Early rounds involve making a number of swaps in a set timeframe, or to achieve a minimum score. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Due to the large number of variables, Toby Walsh from NICTA and University of New South Wales, wanted to see whether the game was a P math problem, or an NP problem. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">P problems are puzzles that are easy to solve, while NP problems are much more difficult and can only be solved by a computer because of the large amount of data produced. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">To <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1911" rel="nofollow" style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank">test this theory</a>, Walsh constructed a theoretical board of candies, in which the size of the board was unrestricted. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">He then tested whether it was possible to create a sequence of swaps (k) that obtained a specific score (s).</font>  </p>
<p class="imageCaption">If a board of candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player has to decide which row to complete first. This sets off a chain reaction and directly influences future moves. Once the game is solved, the player must start again numerous times to try all the possible swap options</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">This turned the game into a mathematical problem. In the process of trying to solve this formula, Walsh concluded the variables and possible outcomes for each level were so high only a computer would be able to process the information – making the puzzle not only NP, but NP-complete. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">NP-complete puzzles have solutions that can be applied to all other NP problems, but finding that one solution is difficult. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">For example, if Walsh found the solution to the Candy Crush problem, in theory, this same solution could be applied to other puzzles with large number of variables and outcomes. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The same strategy was also used to prove games including Super Mario Brothers and Zelda are also NP-hard.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">'Part of its addictiveness may be that Candy Crush is a computationally hard puzzle to solve,' concluded Walsh. </font></p>
