<p>Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a steady open on
Tuesday, as investors remained cautious after the release of
disappointing economic data in China over the weekend continued to
weigh on market sentiment.</p>
<p>Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
pointed to a 0.05% dip, S&amp;P 500 futures signaled a 0.07% loss,
while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.01% gain.</p>
<p>Markets were still jittery after data released over the weekend
showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in
February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a
rise of 10.6% in January.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.</p>
<p>The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy.</p>
<p>The telecom sector was expected to be active, after SoftBank
President Masayoshi Son said he is ready to start a "massive price
war" if U.S. regulators allow Sprint Corp. to purchase T-Mobile US
Inc. Sprint shares edged up 0.11% in after-hour trade.</p>
<p>Among auto stocks, General Motors dipped 0.03% pre-market as a
U.S. House panel was set to investigate U.S. regulators and the
company's response to consumer complaints about ignition-switch
failures that led to the recall of 1.6 million vehicles and are
linked to at least 13 deaths.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Qualcomm Inc. shares were down 0.29% in extended
trade after the provider of mobile-phone chips promoted Derek
Aberle to president, naming a second-in-command to new Chief
Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf.</p>
<p>In the retail sector, Urban Outfitters Inc. plummeted 2.69% in
late trading after saying it expects poor weather to contribute to
lower sales and profit margins in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Citi upgraded J.C. Penney to "buy" with a price target of $11,
sending shares in the department store chain up 4.04% in early
trading.</p>
<p>Other stocks likely to be in focus included Dick's Sporting
Goods and American Eagle Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly
results later in the day.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to lower.
The EURO STOXX 50 dipped 0.04%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.29%,
Germany's DAX added 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 declined
0.41%.</p>
<p>During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
inched up 0.02%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbed 0.69%.</p>
