<p><font>This is one of the first reviews of the new </font><a href="http://www.carscoops.com/2014/01/2015-mercedes-benz-c-class-makes.html"><font>Mercedes-Benz C-Class</font></a><font>, and as expected, the car gets its fair share of praise. Steve Sutcliffe drove a </font><a href="http://www.carscoops.com/search/label/Mercedes"><font>Mercedes</font></a><font> C 250 BlueTec model equipped with the AMG Line trim option and the Airmatic suspension and was pretty impressed with the car.</font> <a name="more"></a> </p>
<p><font>He says the new </font><a href="http://www.carscoops.com/search/label/Mercedes%20C-Class"><font>C-Class</font></a><font> drives better than the previous generation and it feels light and agile. While the C-Class is bigger and seems more expensive inside, it is described as a bit too complex for its own good in terms of ergonomics. </font> </p>
<p><font>But Sutcliffe’s main issue was with the 2.1-liter engine, deemed not quick and pleasant enough for the ears – for the car’s price range, at least (the fully-specced C 250 BlueTec he </font><a href="http://www.carscoops.com/search/label/Reviews"><font>drove</font></a><font> cost just under £40,000 (€47,965).</font> </p>
<p><font>Because of the engine, the reviewer said he isn’t quite sure the C-Class is better than its arch-rival, the BMW 3-Series.
