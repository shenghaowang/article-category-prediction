<p class="lead"><strong>Question: </strong>What does Obamacare mean for the Latino community?

</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For members of all ethnic groups, the Affordable Care Act helps expand
opportunity and freedom to access quality, affordable health coverage that for
too many was denied them. But there are benefits that have a greater impact
specifically on the Latino community. </p>
<p>Latinos are
disproportionately uninsured in the American population. But now 80% of
uninsured Latinos eligible for marketplace coverage will have access to
lower-cost health options, such as tax credits for private insurance plans on
healthcare.gov or BadgerCare here in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Citizens and
documented immigrants may sign up at healthcare.gov. However, undocumented
immigrants may not. But households of mixed status should not fear looking for
coverage. Healthcare.gov cannot require individuals purchasing coverage for
themselves to disclose the immigration/citizen status of anyone else in the
household.</p>
<p>There will be new
options to get health care as well. The Affordable Care Act expands funding to
community health centers, such as the 16th Street Community Health Center here
in Milwaukee, to serve new patients. And one out of every three patients at a
community health center is Latino.</p>
<p>Lastly, Latino
health care professionals will have new opportunities thanks to the Affordable
Care Act. Expanded programs like the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) will
provide more care and train more physicians. One out of ten NHSC physicians are
Latino. That’s twice the rate than in the national physician workforce. New
advancement opportunities are available for many.</p>
<p>While many Americans
speak English as their first language or they are bilingual, some just prefer
their first language. You can apply online at healthcare.gov, and in Spanish at
cuidadodesalud.gov. Get help in more than 150 languages by calling the 24/7
call center at 1-800-318-2596. Open enrollment ends March 31, so be sure to
sign up for the Affordable Care Act while you can.</p>
