<p>There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world’s second-largest economy in February. China’s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on <a data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.kitco.com/finance/futures/details.html?j1_module=futureDetail&amp;popup=1&amp;j1_symbol=NYH14&amp;j1_region=US&amp;j1_selected=chart&amp;_hostparams=&amp;js=1" href="http://www.kitco.com/finance/futures/details.html?j1_module=futureDetail&amp;popup=1&amp;j1_symbol=NYH14&amp;j1_region=US&amp;j1_selected=chart&amp;_hostparams=&amp;js=1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Asian</a> and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week.</p>
<p>The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.</p>
<p>The situation in Ukraine is simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place, at present. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region.</p>
