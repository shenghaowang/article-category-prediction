<p data-page="1">The Chrysler Group has announced it is issuing two separate recalls that will affect nearly 37,000 vehicles in the U.S.</p>
<p>The first recall affects 18,700 Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs from the 2012 and 2013 model years. The vehicles are being recalled to correct an issue with the software in an optional emergency braking system.</p>
<p>The system's factory settings restrict the flow of brake fluid too much, causing customers to complain about an odd feeling in the brake pedal, according to Chrysler. <br/><br/>"Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations," the company said in a statement. Another 6,555 SUVs outside the U.S. have also been recalled. <br/><br/>Also on Chrysler Group's recall list are 18,100 Fiat 500L cars in the U.S. from the 2014 model year.</p>
<p>These cars use an automated dual-clutch transmission, and there have been reports that the gearboxes were slow to shift out of park or into the gear selected by the driver.</p>
<p>Chrysler said a software update will correct the issue, which is tied to extreme temperatures affecting one piece of the transmission. In addition to the cars in the U.S., another 1,400 500L models will be recalled in Canada. Of all the affected models, approximately 200 may need an entirely new shifter.</p>
<p>Chrysler Group will notify owners of all affected vehicles included in the two recalls, and any necessary repairs or updates will be done free of charge by dealers.</p>
<p>No accidents or injuries have been reported as a result of either of these issues, Chrysler Group said</p>
