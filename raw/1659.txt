<p>
  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several U.S. institutional investors said
  they are closely monitoring the developments at Pimco, the
  world's largest bond firm, in the wake of Mohamed El-Erian's
  abrupt resignation as CEO and ensuing acrimony between him and
  co-founder Bill Gross.
</p>
<p>
  The investors, including retirement systems, have formally put
  Pimco on "watch lists," a signal that they will keep a much
  closer eye its performance than usual. It could eventually lead
  to reductions in the amount of money they allocate to funds at
  the firm, whose full name is Pacific Investment Management Co and
  which has $1.91 trillion in assets.
</p>
<p>
  "We intend to go out and meet with them over the course of the
  next month," said David Hunter, chief investment officer of the
  North Dakota State Investment Board. The board, which has about
  $400 million invested with Pimco, put the fund on its watch list
  on February 28.
</p>
<p>
  Hunter said the board could ultimately decide not to make any
  changes to its allocation.
</p>
<p>
  The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest
  U.S. pension fund, said it had not placed Pimco on a formal watch
  list, but it was also paying close attention to developments.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  "CalPERS staff has tremendous respect for the staff at Pimco,"
  the system said in an emailed statement. "That being said, we are
  monitoring the issue and will keep our board aware of the
  changes."
</p>
<p>
  In a statement, Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge said: "We are focused on
  communication with our clients, and have been in regular contact
  with them following the recent leadership transition. They
  understand the changes we have taken and why, and are ready to
  move forward with us."
</p>
<p>
  In a Tweet on Monday, Gross wrote, "No distractions here - just
  long term performance satisfaction - working hard as always for
  clients."
</p>
<p>
  The closer scrutiny by state and local pension systems shows that
  Gross, though, may have more work to do to assuage investor
  concerns after El-Erian's surprise departure and reports of
  growing discord between the two men amid weak fund performance.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, customers withdrew $41.1 billion from Pimco's flagship
  Total Return Fund last year, a record amount for the manager,
  according to investment research firm Morningstar. The fund
  posted another $1.6 billion in outflows in February, reducing
  assets to $236 billion and marking the 10th straight month of
  outflows.
</p>
<p>
  The Total Return Fund, which Gross manages, trailed more than 70
  percent of its peers in February.
</p>
<p>
  Last month, a Wall Street Journal article described the worsening
  relationship between the two men as Pimco's performance
  deteriorated. Later, Gross told Reuters that El-Erian, who is due
  to leave the firm in less than a week, was trying to "undermine"
  him by talking to the Journal.
</p>
<p>
  A memo from investment consultant NEPC to the City of Fresno
  Retirement System Joint Boards noted "an elevated level of
  concern" around the changes at Pimco.
</p>
<p>
  During a recent on-site visit to the bond firm's offices, "it was
  clear that there was a profound sense of disappointment and
  surprise within Pimco regarding Mr. El-Erian's departure," the
  memo said, adding: "Mr. Gross viewed Mr. El-Erian as his
  successor and during the meeting he expressed a level of sadness
  and frustration regarding the resignation."
</p>
<p>
  The Fresno systems were already weighing investing with Pimco
  when news of El-Erian's departure, as well as other staff
  changes, came out. When the city wanted reassurance on
  organizational questions, Pimco sent a team to the Fresno
  offices.
</p>
<p>
  The Fresno systems are now negotiating with Pimco and expect to
  invest money with the firm in coming months.
</p>
<p>
  "You're talking a lot of depth (of the bench). It's not driven by
  two people," said Stanley McDivitt, the systems' retirement
  administrator.
</p>
<p>
  Other investors said they were not in a rush to make changes to
  their allocations.
</p>
<p>
  The Florida State Board of Administration spokesman Dennis MacKee
  said it placed Pimco on its watch list as a routine procedure,
  which it followed for any firm that was undergoing management
  shifts.
</p>
<p>
  The Florida board has about $1.7 billion in its pension fund at
  Pimco and about $240 million from its defined contribution plan
  with the firm.
</p>
<p>
  "We think of our watch list as just enhanced oversight. You look
  a little deeper," MacKee said.
</p>
<p>
  Neil Rue, a managing director at Pension Consulting Alliance,
  said it was too early to make any decisions about how these
  changes might affect Pimco's performance.
</p>
<p>
  "On the fixed income front, we told our clients don't take any
  major action, but we need to watch this closely," Rue said.
</p>
<p>
  If Pimco's style remains consistent, given Gross' strong track
  record over many years, there may be no changes recommended, Rue
  added.
</p>
<p>
  R. T. Jones Capital Equities Management Inc Chief Investment
  Officer Steve Davis said his fund pulled out $100 million from
  Pimco Total Return Fund last year because of a desire to reduce
  duration exposure and interest rate risk, but he would consider
  returning to the bond giant in the future.
</p>
<p>
  "Nor do we think the internal turmoil will negatively affect the
  performance of the fund. In fact, we don't rule out using the
  fund again in the future," Davis said. "We have very high respect
  for Bill Gross and his team at Pimco."
