<p>Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox has been dysfunctional, <a href="https://mashable.com/2014/02/28/mt-gox-bankruptcy/">bankrupt</a> and shrouded with a veil of mystery for weeks. The site's owners said in February 744,408 bitcoins <a href="https://mashable.com/2014/02/25/bitcoin-mt-gox-down/">were stolen</a> due to a glitch in the Bitcoin protocol and took the site down, but updates were scarce since then. </p>
<p>Now, unidentified hackers claim they have data, including database dumps, that proves Mt. Gox's owners actually kept the bitcoins for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/09/hackers-hit-mt-gox-exchanges-ceo-claim-to-publish-evidence-of-fraud/" target="_blank">According to a report</a> by <em>Forbes</em>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zz21j/mtgox_2014_hack_database_revealed_live_from_mark/" target="_blank">Hackers claim</a> to have stolen the data from Mt. Gox's servers; they also took control of CEO Mark Karpeles' Reddit account and personal blog. </p>
<p>"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," hackers wrote, claiming no user database dumps have been included. </p>
<p>The data comprises of a spreadsheet of more than a million trades on Mt. Gox as well as a 716MB file that appears to show Mt. Gox's balance in 18 currencies, including bitcoin. The file points to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox, with a note saying "That fat f*ck has been lying." At the current exchange rate on bitcoin exchange <a href="https://btc-e.com/" target="_blank">BTC-e.com</a>, that amount of bitcoins is worth approximately $595 million. </p>

<p>Early <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zz21j/mtgox_2014_hack_database_revealed_live_from_mark/" target="_blank">reports</a> on Reddit claim the database file is genuine, but it's hard to confirm anything at this point, especially since many of the related posts on Reddit have been deleted. </p>
<p>Mt.Gox did not directly respond to the incident, but it did put a <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20140308-spam_warning.pdf" target="_blank">warning notice</a> over the weekend, claiming that phishing emails impersonating Mt.Gox were being sent to users and warning them not to respond to these emails. </p>
