<p>With all of the nasty rhetoric and misinformation floating around about Obamacare, I thought I'd personally share with you how the Affordable Care Act has affected me.</p>
<p>In 2013, I paid Blue Cross Blue Shield $414.31 per month for individual health insurance with a $5,000 deductible. That is $4,971.72 per year, plus the $5,000 deductible, and it would cost me $9,971.72 for health care before BCBS would have to spend one thin dime. That almost feels like I don't have health insurance, except for something catastrophic.</p>
<p>Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, my premium dropped to $278.90, or $3,346.80 per year, a savings of $1,624.92 per year. That is a lot more "affordable" for me.</p>
