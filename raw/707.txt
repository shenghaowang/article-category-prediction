<p>  U.S. fruit distributor <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="14060" data-inline-quote-symbol="CQB" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CQB" target="_self">Chiquita Brands International Inc</a> is to buy Irish rival <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="17425" data-inline-quote-symbol="FQ3-IE" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FQ3-IE" target="_self">Fyffes Plc</a> in an all-stock deal valued at $526 million to create the world's biggest banana supplier.  </p>
<p>The transaction will create a fresh produce company worth about $4.6 billion in annual revenues and it is expected to generate operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016. </p>
<p>  Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the combined company, ChiquitaFyffes, while Fyffes shareholders will have the remaining 49.3 percent, the companies said in a statement on Monday.  </p>
<p>  The New York-listed combined company will have tax savings from being domiciled in Ireland, similar to U.S. drugmaker <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="146752" data-inline-quote-symbol="PRGO" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=PRGO" target="_self">Perrigo's</a> acquisition of Elan last year.  </p>
<p>  Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38 percent over its Friday's closing price.  </p>
<p>  Fyffes shares jumped 29 percent to 1.15 euros by 0710 GMT.  </p>
<p>  The deal could raise antitrust issues, given that more than 80 percent of the global banana market is controlled by four multinationals - Chiquita, Fyffes, <a class="inline_quotes" data-gdsid="17309" data-inline-quote-symbol="FDP" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FDP" target="_self">Fresh Del Monte</a> and Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company - according to the United Nations.  </p>
