<p>Wall Street eased modestly, as investors had their first chance to react to soft data out of China over the weekend.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones lostÂ 0.2 per cent to close at 16,419.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 was also down, but a mere 1 point to 1,877, while the Nasdaq was off 2 points to 4,334.</p>
<p>An unexpectedly sharp 18 per cent pull-back in China's exports fuelled concern on Wall Street that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.</p>
<p>The data set off an sharp 8.3 per cent slide in the iron ore price, its biggest one-day price fall in more than four years.</p>
<p>Iron ore was worth $US104.70 at Tianjin in China, which is its lowest price since October 2012, and Chinese steel futures dropped to record lows.</p>
<p>John Noonan, Head of IFR Forexwatch Asia for Thomson Reuters, says China's latest import and export data is largely to blame.</p>
<p>"The main factor is expectations that last month's slump in iron ore imports by China will continue due to the weakening yuan and huge stockpiles at China ports," he said.</p>
<p>Back in the US, and shares in Boeing, manufacturer of the Malaysia Airline's plane that is missing presumed crashed, dropped 2 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The sharp fall in metal prices weighed on mining stocks on London's FTSE 100, which is heavy on resources stocks, and it closed down 0.4 per cent to 6,689.</p>
<p>Shares in Rio Tinto lost 1.9 per cent, after having fallen much more steeply yesterday in Australia.</p>
<p>Markets were mixed in Europe, with France's CAC rising 0.1 per cent, but Germany's DAX losing 0.9 per cent.</p>
<p>The Australian share market was set for a flat start to trade - the ASX SPI 200 was up 1 point at 5,421.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was buying 90.19 US cents.</p>
<p>On commodity markets, the spot gold price was slightly lower at $US1,339.91 an ounce.</p>
<p>Oil continues to see steady trade, with West Texas crude barely changed from Friday at $US101.34 a barrel, and Singapore's Tapis crude priced at $US114.56.</p>
