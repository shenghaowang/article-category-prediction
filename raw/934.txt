<p>Investing.com - Gold and silver prices shook off earlier
weakness to trade higher on Monday, as investors continued to
monitor events in Ukraine, where tension over moves by neighboring
Russia in the Crimean region have heightened demand for safe haven
assets.</p>
<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery fell to a session low of $1,328.20 an
ounce, the weakest since February 28.</p>
<p>Gold last traded at $1,344.10 an ounce during U.S. morning
hours, up 0.45%, or $5.90. Prices lost 1.01%, or $13.60 an ounce,
on Friday to settle at $1,338.20.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Gold futures were likely to find support at $1,319.30 a troy
ounce, the low from February 28 and resistance at $1,355.00, the
high from March 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver for May delivery fell to a daily low of $20.62
a troy ounce, the cheapest since February 14, before recovering to
trade at $20.96, up 0.2%, or $0.04 cents.</p>
<p>The May silver contract ended Friday's session down 2.99%, or
$0.64 cents, to settle at $20.92 an ounce.</p>
<p>Silver futures were likely to find support at $20.44 a troy
ounce, the low from February 14 and resistance at $21.61, the high
from March 7.</p>
<p>Precious metals were lower earlier in the session as
expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually
reduce the pace of its stimulus program weighed.</p>
<p>The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. economy added
175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new
jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January,
as more people joined the workforce.</p>
<p>The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic
data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the
Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its
bond-buying program.</p>
<p>Market players will be anticipating what will be closely-watched
U.S. data on retail sales and consumer sentiment later in the week
for further indications of the strength of the economy and the
future course of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery tumbled
1.1%, or $0.033 cents, to trade at $3.049 a pound.</p>
<p>Prices hit a session low of $2.996 a pound earlier, the weakest
since June 25, as growing concerns over the health of China's
economy dampened demand for growth-linked assets.</p>
<p>Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing
expectations for a 6.8% increase.</p>
<p>The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February.</p>
<p>A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China
rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations,
while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts
for a 1.9% drop.</p>
