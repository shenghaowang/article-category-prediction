<p>Investing.com - Gold rose to the highest level since September
on Wednesday, as mounting tensions over the ongoing political and
military crisis between Russia and the West over Ukraine boosted
demand for safe-haven assets.</p>
<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,369.00 a
troy ounce, the most since September 19.</p>
<p>Gold last traded at $1,366.40 an ounce during U.S. morning
hours, up 1.46%, or $19.70. Gold picked up 0.39% or $5.20 an ounce
on Tuesday to settle at $1,346.70.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce,
the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,375.10, the high from
September 19.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver for May delivery rallied 1.57%, or $0.32
cents, to trade at $21.14 a troy ounce. Silver ended Tuesday's
session down 0.45%, or $0.09 cents, to settle at $20.81 an
ounce.</p>
<p>Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension
over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have
heightened demand for safe haven assets.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Group of Seven biggest industrial nations warned
Russia on Wednesday not to annex Crimea.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of
Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that
protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."</p>
<p>Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with
further action "individually and collectively."</p>
<p>Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will meet
with U.S. President Barack Obama later in the day, as diplomatic
efforts to resolve the crisis continued.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures extended losses from the
previous session to hit a daily low of $2.908 a pound, the weakest
since July 2010. Copper last traded at $2.939 a pound, down
0.45%.</p>
<p>Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions
as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened
demand for growth-linked assets.</p>
<p>In addition, there were concerns over the state of the country's
corporate sector. Investors remained jittery over signs of weakness
in the bond market after last week's default by Chinese solar
company Chaori Shanghai Solar Energy Science &amp; Technology
Co.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the focus was on Shanghai-based Baoding Tianwei
Baobian Electric Co., a power equipment manufacturer for the new
energy sector. Shares in the company sank more than 5% in Shanghai,
while its corporate bond was suspended for a second day, after it
reported a full-year net loss for the second consecutive year,
which led to a delisting warning.</p>
<p>Concerns over domestic bond defaults stoked investor worries
that financing deals that have locked up vast quantities of copper
could unravel.</p>
<p>The Asian nation is the world's largest copper consumer,
accounting for almost 40% of world consumption last year.</p>
