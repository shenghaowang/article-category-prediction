<p>Singapore: Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 5-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal`s safe-haven appeal.</p>
<p>Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at USD 1,355 an ounce, traders said.</p>
<p>Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing nearly 2 percent.</p>
<p>"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.</p>
<p>"It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said.</p>
<p>"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold`s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets."</p>
<p>Spot gold had gained 0.7 percent to USD 1,358.10 an ounce by 0710 GMT, after earlier hitting USD 1,362.24 - its highest since September 20. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. gold futures rose over 1 percent to their 5-1/2 month high of USD 1,364.10.</p>
<p>Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.</p>
<p>Ukraine`s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days.</p>
<p>China`s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world`s second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.</p>
<p>In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock.</p>
<p><b>PHYSICAL MARKETS</b></p>
<p>Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices.</p>
<p>In China, the world`s biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of USD 20.</p>
<p>Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce.</p>
