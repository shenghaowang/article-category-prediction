<p><strong>HILSENRATH’S TAKE</strong><br/>
Take note of the fact that central bankers are talking a lot lately about the impact of “persistent headwinds” against the economy. They are making an argument that is central to view that they should keep interest rates unusually low even after they start rising from near zero.</p>
<p>New York Fed president William Dudley said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this month that “persistent headwinds” to growth explained why the economy would be unable to bear much higher interest rates in the years ahead. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said in a press conference last month that “persistent headwinds mean that, even in the medium term, the level of interest rates necessary to sustain low unemployment and price stability will be materially lower than before the crisis.” Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said in a press conference last September, “we expect that a number of factors—including the slow recovery of the housing sector, continued fiscal drag, perhaps continued effects from the financial crisis—may still prove to be headwinds to the recovery.”</p>
