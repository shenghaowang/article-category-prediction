<p>U.S. stocks are closing slightly lower following disappointing economic news from China and Japan.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index edged down a point to close at 1,877 Monday. It had been down 11 points earlier.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418. The Nasdaq composite fell two points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.</p>
<p>Investors were discouraged by an 18 percent slump in Chinese exports last month, the latest sign of trouble for the world’s second-largest economy. Japan lowered its estimate for fourth-quarter economic growth.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Chiquita Brands jumped 11 percent after announcing it had agreed to combine with an Irish fruit supply company.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.78 percent.</p>
