<p>Investing.com - The economic calendar for the week ending March
21 contains reports on the U.S. housing sector, inflation and
factory activity, but the main event that investors will be
focusing on is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting,
concluding on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the euro zone is to produce
what will be closely watched data on inflation. Here are the main
events to watch out for:</p>
<p>
<strong>Federal Open Market Committee Meeting</strong>
</p>
<p>This will be the first Federal Reserve board meeting with Janet
Yellen at the helm. Investors expect the Fed to continue to taper
its bond purchasing program by $10 billion to $55 billion, despite
recent weak U.S. economic reports. The central bank is also
expected to hold interest rates at record lows.
<br/>

The Fed meeting is to be followed by a press conference with Janet
Yellen and the bank is also to publish its forecasts on inflation
and economic growth.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>
<strong>U.S. inflation report</strong>
</p>
<p>The U.S. inflation report is due to be published on Tuesday.
U.S. inflation has remained at a very low level in recent years,
allowing leeway for the Federal Reserve to hold the benchmark
interest rate close to zero.</p>
<p>
<strong>Euro zone inflation report</strong>
</p>
<p>The euro zone is to release official data on the annual rate of
inflation on Monday, amid concerns over deflationary pressures.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday the
strong euro was dragging down inflation, indicating growing
concerns that the appreciation of the euro could undermine the
fragile recovery in the euro area. The annual rate of inflation in
the euro area came in at 0.8% in February, well below the ECB'S
target of just under 2%.</p>
<p>
<strong>U.S. housing sector data</strong>
</p>
<p>On Tuesday the U.S. is to release official data on building
permits and housing starts. This will be followed by a private
sector report on existing home sales on Thursday. Housing starts
dropped 16% in January as a result of severe winter weather, while
building permits fell 4.6%. Weather conditions remained bad in
February, so forecasters are expecting only a moderate rebound of
3.4% for housing starts in February.</p>
<p>
<strong>German ZEW</strong>
</p>
<p>The ZEW Centre for Economic Research is to publish its report on
German economic sentiment on Tuesday. The index deteriorated
slightly in February amid concerns that the economic recovery in
the U.S. is losing momentum and forecasters expect the index to
continue to tick lower this month.</p>
<p>
<strong>New Zealand GDP</strong>
</p>
<p>New Zealand is to publish data on fourth quarter gross domestic
product on Wednesday. Last week, the New Zealand dollar rallied to
10-month highs against the greenback after the Reserve Bank raised
interest rates to 2.75% from a record low 2.5%, becoming the first
developed nation to exit record-low borrowing costs. The bank also
revised up its forecast for growth in the year to March 31.</p>
