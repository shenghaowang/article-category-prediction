<p>BEIJING â€” Common interests between China and the United States far outweigh the countries' differences, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday, sounding a cordial note following a minor spat over President Barack Obama's recent meeting with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Li told reporters that the two nations could do much more to further "unleash the potential" of bilateral cooperation and build on their already massive $520 billion in annual bilateral trade.</p>
<p>He cited a Chinese saying that "wise people will seek common interests, while the unwise will focus on their differences."</p>
<p>"China and the United States need to focus more on common ground in pursuit of long-term benefits," Li said at a news conference after the close of the annual meeting of the country's legislature.</p>
<p>Li did not mention Obama's meeting late last month with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing denounces as a separatist. The meeting prompted swift and vehement protests from China.</p>
<p>Relations between China and the U.S. have been stable in recent months despite tensions between Beijing and American allies in the region, especially Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Li reiterated that China has "an abiding commitment" to peace in the region, but also an "unshakable will in safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."</p>
<p>Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a rare private two-day summit last June designed to build a personal relationship between him and China's new leader, with the two hashing out thorny issues between their countries.</p>
<p>China's rise to become the world's second-largest economy and its rapid military expansion have unnerved many in the U.S., while a large portion of the Chinese public believes Washington is intent on stifling China's gains.</p>
<p>However, ties have continued apace, and first Lady Michelle Obama is due to arrive next Thursday for a weeklong visit to China, accompanied by her two daughters.<br/>
