<p>Investing.com - Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that
some defaults of investment products in the financial markets can't
be avoided, but pledged to contain systemic risk.
<br/>
<br/>

Chinese debt levels are below international averages and overall
risks are under control and that the regulation of shadow banking
activities is an attempt to start "opening the front door while
closing back doors," Li told reporters at a rare press conference
on the sidelines of a national leadership meeting ending Thursday.
<br/>
<br/>

Li also said the government's 7.5% GDP target is a flexible one,
indicating that job creation remains a prime factor of economic
policy-making.
<br/>
<br/>

"Around 7.5% means there is flexibility. We can tolerate a bit
higher or lower growth. The acceptable floor ... is a growth rate
that will generate enough jobs," Li said.</p>
