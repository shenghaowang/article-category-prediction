<p class="description">BITCOIN exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 DDoS attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.</p>
<p>The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.</p>
<p>While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.</p>
<p>Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.</p>

<p>The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.</p>
<p>MtGox&amp;aposs lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm&amp;aposs customers had gone missing, along with about 100,000 units the company owned.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.</p>
<p>After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $US40 a coin in late 2012 and $US1100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.</p>
<p>Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.</p>
<p>US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.</p>
