<p style="order:0;">Herbalife said Wednesday it is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p style="order:1;">“Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,” the company said in a statement. "We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."  </p>
<p style="order:2;">Shares in the company fell by as much as 17.5 percent during the day on Wednesday. The stock closed at $60.57 a share, down about 7 percent.</p>
<p style="order:3;">The stock will continue to be depressed during the course of Herbalife’s investigation, said Kerry Fields, a professor of business law and ethics at USC’s Marshall School of Business. He said he doesn’t think Herbalife’s revenues would be impacted by the investigation because a good portion of its sales is in developing countries.</p>
<p style="order:4;">“Their revenue might not be affected, by their overall corporate image will take a hit over the next six months while the investigation proceeds in earnest,” Fields told KPCC. </p>
<p style="order:5;">Herbalife made the announcement just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company. Ackman repeatedly has bet against the company and says he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p style="order:6;">Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square, declined to comment on the FTC's investigation.</p>
<p style="order:7;">FTC spokesman Frank Dorman confirmed to KPCC that there is an investigation, but declined further comment.</p>
