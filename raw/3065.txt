<p>Vodafone has agreed to buy Spanish cable operator Ono for about $10bn, expanding the UK telco's European footprint.</p>
<p>Vodafone will acquire Ono for €7.2bn ($10.03bn, £6bn), including about €3.3bn in debt. Private equity-backed Ono is Vodafone's third acquisition in European fixed-broadband industry in two years.</p>
<p>Vodafone intends to source the acquisition from existing cash and debt.</p>
<p>Shares in the company rose 1.06% as at 8:42 am GMT, following the announcement.</p>
<p>The deal was reached after months of talks with Ono and its private equity owners: Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H Lee Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital, according to the Financial Times.</p>
<p>"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone," said Vittorio Colao, Vodafone CEO.</p>
<p>"This transaction reflects Ono's attractive position as Spain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communications," said José María Castellano Ríos, chairman of the Ono board.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to be part of the company's strategy to enlarge its global footprint after the $120bn sale of US arm to Verizon Wireless.</p>
<p>In September, Vodafone agreed to buy a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel Deutschland. It had earlier agreed with French telecoms operator Orange to build out fibre networks in Spain – a move which is expected to complement the Ono deal.</p>
<p><strong>Attractive Synergies</strong></p>
<p>Ono is Spain's second-largest provider of broadband internet, pay TV and fixed-line. Vodafone is likely to add extra products to bundled tariffs as well as reduce the cost of its offerings.</p>
<p>"Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the past few years in Spain, and this transaction – together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme – will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market," Colao added.</p>

<p>The company expects about €1bn of revenue synergies by combining distribution, marketing and cross-selling in Spain. Meanwhile, annual cost and capital expenditure synergies are expected at about €240m.</p>
