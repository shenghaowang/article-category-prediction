<p>The widening of the yuan trading band by the People's Bank of China is an important milestone on the path to further reforms but it also means that the Chinese currency is less of a sure bet for speculative investors.</p>
<p>The reform, announced on Saturday, means that the limits within which the yuan is allowed to trade against the US dollar have been doubled to as much as 2 per cent above or below the daily fix as of Monday.</p>

<p>In reality however, the yuan has been a largely one-way bet attracting enormous capital from investors. It has appreciated almost uninterrupted against the greenback for at least the past seven years until the PBOC intervened in foreign exchange markets last month to intentionally devalue the currency. That exercise was designed to introduce some volatility into the market as a precursor to the widening of the trading band and served as a warning to speculators.</p>
<p>National Australia Bank's global co-head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attrill, said that investors trading offshore yuan for the currency appreciation and also higher yield on offer could no longer count on it being as concrete a bet. "It's going to be a more treacherous playground for people playing the carry trade," he said. "They can be much less confident those gains are assured."</p>
<p>Even so, NAB still takes a bullish view on the yuan in the medium-term.</p>
<p>Mr Attrill thinks that if China floated the yuan and dropped its capital constraints the currency would probably depreciate, reflecting the pent-up demand for Chinese nationals to invest their capital in overseas markets.</p>
<p>But with that scenario still many years away, the PBOC in the meantime risks pushing the yuan higher with its widening of the trading band, potentially inviting greater demand from offshore. That leaves the central bank holding even greater foreign exchange reserves which need to be recycled into the market, perhaps in the form of US dollar accumulation.</p>
<p>"In a way this is probably a fairly minor step along the road to reform subject to how much the new wider bands are allowed to operate in practice," Mr Attrill said. "When you think that when we were in the plus-or-minus 1 per cent band there was no day when the currency was allowed to move the full extent," he observed. "In that sense it's a little bit disingenuous to say we're going to have big swings in the currency." He thinks three-to-five years is a reasonable time frame to expect some substantial progress from China on financial markets liberalisation.</p>
<p>David Liao, HSBC's head of global banking and markets for China, said: "This timely decision provides further evidence of China's commitment to liberalising financial markets, and marks another step in renminbi's progress towards full convertibility. This demonstrates the policymaker's determination to speed up financial reforms."</p>
