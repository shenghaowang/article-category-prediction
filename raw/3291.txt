<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor">Bank of England</a> concern about the pound's strength has been revealed in comments from one of Threadneedle Street's top officials, who has said a further rise in sterling would damage hopes of an export boost to the economy.</p>
<p>Charlie Bean, one of the Bank's two deputy governors, said the UK's recent trade performance had been unimpressive despite help from a sharp fall in the value of the currency in the 18 months after the financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007.</p>
<p>The pickup in growth since spring 2013 has been accompanied by an increase of almost 10% in the pound's value against a basket of world currencies, and Bean said any further appreciation would be unwelcome.</p>
<p>Speaking in Darlington, the Bank's deputy governor for monetary policy said a rebalancing of growth towards exports was needed to ensure Britain's recovery was "sustained and sustainable".</p>
<p>He said: "The prerequisites for such a switch of demand towards net exports seemed to have been put in place by the substantial depreciation in sterling that occurred during the financial crisis. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling">Sterling</a> fell more than 25% between the middle of 2007 and the beginning of 2009.</p>
<p>"Despite the slowdown in our main export markets, that should have been sufficient to give a kick to net exports. The performance of exports – particularly exports of services – has, however, to date been somewhat disappointing."</p>
<p>Bean said anecdotal evidence of businesses bringing back to the UK activities that they had previously "offshored" could mean it was simply a matter of time before the UK began to close a current account deficit worth 4% of national output in 2013.</p>
<p>"But any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10% in trade-weighted terms since March, would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports."</p>
