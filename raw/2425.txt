<p>The move will take effect on March 17, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its web site.</p>
<p>It follows a statement by the central bank last month that it was seeking an “orderly expansion” of the trading band as a policy goal.</p>
<p>“In order to meet the demands of market development, increase the strength of the market-determined exchange rate and establish a market-based, managed floating exchange rate regime, the People's Bank of China has decided to widen the floating range of the renminbi against the US dollar,” the bank said in its statement.</p>
<p>It added that the bank “will further develop the role of the market in the RMB exchange rate formulation mechanism”.</p>
<p>China's ruling Communist Party has maintained a firm grip on the yuan — also known as the renminbi, or RMB — as one of its key tools to control the economy, and due to worries about unpredictable financial inflows or outflows.</p>
<p>In widening the currency's trading band, Chinese authorities “must feel that the economy is in a strong enough position to handle an adjustment and other possible reforms ahead,” Paul Mackel, head of Asian currency research at HSBC Holdings, told Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p>The yuan has risen steadily against the dollar over the past year, but it reversed course last month to weaken around one percent — a depreciation that analysts say may have been engineered by the central bank to target speculative funds betting on continued appreciation.</p>
