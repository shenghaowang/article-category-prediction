<p>Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is set to appear before the Treasury Select Committee over the bank’s alleged forex rate fixing.</p>
<p>This is after minutes of meetings from 2006 were published last Wednesday following a Freedom of Information request. The records show that a senior member of the Bank of England’s staff was told of “attempts to move the market”.</p>
<p>The Bank said that there was no evidence to prove the allegations. However, one member of staff has been suspended over compliance concerns.</p>
<p>Committee member Andrea Leadsom said that Carney would be questioned on whether the bank “did nothing” about forex rigging suspicions.</p>
<p>“It looks to me that the bank could be accused either of complacency or extreme naivety,” the Conservative MP for South Northamptonshire told the BBC.</p>
<p>“What we need to know is that they themselves are sufficiently governed,” she said.</p>
