<p>General Motors is at the center of a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>In February, the automaker recalled more than 1.5 million vehicles for a faulty ignition switch linked to 13 deaths.</p>
<p>Vehicles on the GM recall list include 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006 and 2007 Chevy HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky, 2005-2007 Chevy Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5S.</p>
<p>The company first learned of the problem a decade earlier.</p>
<p>When CBS News aired its first investigative report into the problem, Vicki Harrington said she was scared. Two teenage girls were killed when a Chevrolet Cobalt went off the road in 2006. For Harrington, a mother from West Des Moines, the similarities between the crash and her daughter’s vehicle were startling.</p>
<p>“It was a 2005 Cobalt that they were driving, and hers is a 2006,” she said.</p>
<p>Her daughter, Katie, has been driving a Chevy Cobalt for about six years. A few weeks ago she attempted to get its ignition fixed at an authorized GM dealership. However, the dealership told her its hands were tied and offered no solutions.</p>
<p>GM is offering free loaner vehicles while it waits for parts to arrive for repairs or $500 toward the purchase of a new car.</p>
<p>GM dealerships across the metro would not respond to requests for comment on how many drivers the recall affected.</p>
<p>“Sometimes they don’t think it’s significant enough or it’s not enough vehicles having the problem,” said local mechanic John Merriam.</p>
<p>A faulty ignition switch can cause the engine to shut down and disable airbags.</p>
<p>GM indicated Wednesday that it knows of 31 crashes and 13 deaths that resulted from recalled vehicles, leaving Harrington looking elsewhere for her daughter’s next car.</p>
<p>“The way they’ve handled this whole situation has just been completely unacceptable,” Harrington said.</p>
