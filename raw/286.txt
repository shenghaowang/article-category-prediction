<p>Angry Birds developer Rovio tells <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/03/angry-birds-android-1-

million-advertising/">TechCrunch</a> that it expects to make over $1 million in monthly revenues from the free-to-play 

version of its popular bird-catapulting game.</p>
<p>"By end of year, we project earnings of over $1 million per month 

with the ad-supported version of Angry Birds," Rovio CEO Peter Vesterbacka told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The iPhone version of 

the game costs money, but the Android version is self-published and free. The game makes money off ads it serves up to the 

user. The Android version of the game has been downloaded over five million times from the Android Market. Vesterbacka also 

told TechCrunch that the Angry Birds series has an 80 percent retention rate, based on the number of players that return to 

download updates.</p>

<p>..And in other news, the sky is blue. What makes some comment threads longer than others? Bad attitudes 

and surly comments, apparently. That is the conclusion of a study about online interaction conducted by a team of Slovenian 

and British researchers .</p>
<p>A group of Slovenian and British researchers used a technique called "sentiment 

analysis" to identify emotional content in BBC's online discussion forums and digg.com.</p>
<p>The team's special 

algorithms searched for keywords, emoticons, and "subtle linguistic markers" like misspellings, which were then 

used to calculate a "happiness score" for each post. The researchers found that longer discussion threads tended 

to be overwhelmingly emotional and negative than shorter discussions threads. The longer threads tended to begin with 

negative comments, researchers found. <span class="read-more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/07/research-negative-comment-

<p>The Entertainment Consumer Association sent out an alert this afternoon to its members urging them to 

write the Federal Communications Commission to tell them that America wants the net neutrality promised by the president 

during his campaign.</p>
<p>The ECA objects to the plan proposed by the FCC because it gives too many concessions to interest 

groups and service providers, excludes wireless providers from any new rules, and gives providers a green light to start 

using tiered pricing models based on the amount of bandwidth / data used. The ECA has set up a "call to action" 

page <a href="http://action.theeca.com/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=2877">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are planning your last will and testament in the state of Oklahoma, you now have to worry about 

what to do with your virtual belongings. According to a report in the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/88106/20101202/new-oklahama-law-puts-control-of-deceased-s-social-media-accounts-in-

estate-executors.htm">IB Times</a> (thanks EZK), a new state law in Oklahoma gives estate executors and administrators 

the power to "access, administer, or terminate" social media and online accounts.</p>
<p>According to former state 

Rep. Ryan Kiesel (D-Seminole), a co-author of House Bill 2800 (before he left office), the law is meant to remind people 

that, when they are planning what happens to their real-world estate, they should probably figure out what they want done 

with their virtual stuff as well. <span class="read-more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/07/ok-law-addresses-virtual-

<p>Rock, Paper, Shotgun's John Walker responds to the Panorama TV episode on game addiction (it aired on BBC 

1 in the UK last night) with an editorial of his own. While acknowledging that he does not "possess the evidence that 

gaming does not cause addiction," Walker lays into the Panorama episode and its host for producing a slapdash expose on 

gaming addiction, leading viewers to conclusions without providing any real evidence.</p>
<p>For example, the show promised 

to provide details on the secret mechanics that keep gamers "coming back for more," but that secret gaming sauce 

was never revealed during the program. Likewise, while the host talked a lot about studies that claimed to make a connection 

between gaming and addiction, no proof was ever provided.</p>
<p>Here is a sample from Walker's editorial: <span class="read-more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/07/rps-editorial-panorama-game-addiction-show"><strong><font color="#8e0505">Read More</font></strong></a></span></p>
<p>A recent tip to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/12/05/new-zealand-leak-us-.html">Boing Boing</a> 

from <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5498/125/">Michael Geist</a> reveals some new leaks related from the 

New Zealand government about their skepticism of international copyright laws being pushed by a certain country. 

Specifically, the leaked documents reveal the NZ government’s doubts about the U.S.'s push to change the level of 

protection the country affords "technical protection measures" (TPMs, DRM, or digital locks).</p>
<p>The U.S. wants 

NZ to make jailbreaking illegal. Interestingly enough, while the U.S. pushes for new jailbreaking rules in other countries 

around the world, at home the U.S. copyright office recently suspended the restriction on jailbreaking iPhones for three 

years.. <span class="read-more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/07/nz-leaks-reveal-skepticism-ip-law-push"><strong><font color="#8e0505">Read More</font></strong></a></span></p>
<p>The Panorama episode aired on BBC One in the UK earlier this evening. For anyone that does not live in 

the UK, the show has made its way to YouTube in two parts (<em>thanks to Andrew Eisen for the tip</em>).</p>
<p>We will spare 

you the commentary on the show - watch it and judge for yourselves if Panorama producers were fair in their report on video 

game addiction. On a related note, Shoutboxer beemoh points out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/panorama/2010/12/computer_games_-_a_hard_habit.html">this discussion thread</a> on the BBC 

web site about the program.</p>
<p>Parts one and two linked below:</p>

<p>UK-based video game industry trade group UKIE issued a statement today praising UK Secretary of State for 

Culture, Media and Sport Jeremy Hunt's proposal on a high-speed broadband roll out in the United Kingdom. The plan calls for 

creating infrastructure in the country that would give "every community in the UK" access to "super-

fast" broadband by 2015.</p>
<p>"<i>The UK's games and interactive entertainment industry is a highly skilled, 

digital industry spread throughout the UK</i>," said Michael Rawlinson, Director General of UKIE. "<i>It needs the 

technological infrastructure of super-fast broadband to thrive and develop ever more sophisticated forms of interactive 

entertainment, and to allow new business start-ups to grow and flourish.</i>" <span class="read-more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/06/ukie-applauds-government-broadband-plan"><strong><font color="#8e0505">Read

<p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2010-12-06-panoramas-emeke-onono-

interview">GameIndustry.biz</a> Panorama producer and director Emeka Onono, explains why the BBC news program decided to 

tackle the subject of game addiction. While Onono claims that the program is not "anti-gaming," his comments to 

GI.biz do not sound game industry friendly.</p>
<p>"<i>What we've said is there's a potential for things in games to be 

addictive</i>," he explains to GamesIndustry.biz. "<i>There is a potential there. And that's something that the 

industry's always doggedly denied. The fact is it's there and however small or large that possibility is it needs to be 

researched and acknowledged.</i>"</p>
<p>Onono also accuses a segment of the games industry of being "very 

defensive" on the issue of addiction: <span class="read-more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/06/panorama-producer-defends-

<p>According to data gathered by internet research firm ComScore, Cyber Monday saw the heaviest online 

spending day in history. Gian Fulgoni, the chairperson of the organization, said that Cyber Monday was "a historic day 

for e-commerce."</p>
<p>How momentous an occasion? How historic? According to the data, online retailers made $1.028 

billion for the day, up 16 percent from a year ago. That number is a milestone for online retailers because it is the very 

first time that online one-day sales surpassed the billion-dollar mark.</p>
<p>"<i>The online holiday shopping season 

has clearly gotten off to a very strong start, which is welcome news</i>," said Fulgoni.”<i>At the same time, it 

is important to note that some of the early strength in consumer spending is almost certainly the result of retailers' 

heavier-than-normal promotional and discounting activity at this early point in the season.</i>" <span class="read- more"><a href="http://o/2010/12/06/comscore-cyber-monday-sales-039historic039"><strong><font color="#8e0505">Read
