<p>Investing.com - Gold prices rallied to the highest level since
September on Wednesday, as demand for safe haven assets was
supported by lingering concerns over the standoff in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,363.20 a
troy ounce, the most since September 20.</p>
<p>Gold last traded at $1,358.20 an ounce during European morning
hours, up 0.85%, or $11.10. Gold picked up 0.39%, or $5.20 an
ounce, on Tuesday to settle at $1,346.70.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce,
the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,366.50, the high from
September 20.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver for May delivery rallied 1.2%, or $0.25 cents,
to trade at $21.06 a troy ounce. Silver ended Tuesday's session
down 0.45%, or $0.09 cents, to settle at $20.81 an ounce.</p>
<p>Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension
over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have
heightened demand for safe haven assets.</p>
<p>Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was to travel
to the U.S. to meet President Barack Obama on Wednesday, as
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data
later in the week for further indications on the strength of the
economy and the future course of monetary policy.</p>
<p>The U.S. is to release closely-watched data on retail sales for
February on Thursday and a report on consumer sentiment on
Friday.</p>
<p>Data released last week showed that the U.S. economy added
175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new
jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January,
as more people joined the workforce.</p>
<p>The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic
data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the
Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its
bond-buying program.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures extended losses from the
previous session to hit a daily low of $2.918 a pound, the weakest
since July 2010.</p>
<p>Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions
as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened
demand for growth-linked assets.</p>
