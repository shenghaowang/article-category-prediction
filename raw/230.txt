<p>The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into General Motors' decade-long failure to address deadly safety problems before announcing a huge vehicle recall last month, according to people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is focused on whether GM, the nation's largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects. The prosecutors, one of the people said, are questioning if GM misled federal regulators about the extent of the problems.</p>
<p>The investigation is the latest in a widening series of threats to GM over its handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he would ask Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks.</p>
<p>A House committee said on Monday that it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM's recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, and it sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>That agency is also investigating GM's actions since the company learned of possible defects in its ignition systems, in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll of fatal accidents.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether any of the inquiries will lead to charges against GM. If the prosecutors in New York are unable to prove criminal liability, they could pursue civil charges instead.</p>
<p>The federal inquiry is the Justice Department's latest move to investigate how automakers have responded to recalls.</p>
<p>The GM investigation, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company's admission to the safety agency on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches over the last 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.</p>
<p>When asked on Tuesday about the inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the investigation.</p>
<p>"It's high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die," said Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a private watchdog group.</p>
