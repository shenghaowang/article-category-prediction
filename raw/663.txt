<p>The makers of the hugely popular and addictive Candy Crush Saga mobile app have set its flotation price at level that will make its owners millionaires many times over.</p>
<p>Online games designer King Digital, which is domiciled in Dublin but based in Tottenham Court Road, has set a price of between US$21-24 per share a level, which values the company at more than US$7.5bn at the top end.</p>
<p>It is staggering valuation for a company that generates three quarters of its revenues from Candy Crush, but technology IPOs have been among the hottest properties on Wall Street in recent months following the success of the listing of <a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/overviewOld/na/4493/Facebook" rel="4493">Facebook</a> (<a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="/companies/overview/4493/facebook-4493.html" rel="4493">NASDAQ:FB</a>) and <a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/overviewOld/na/5263/Twitter" rel="5263">Twitter</a> (<a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="/companies/overview/5263/twitter-5263.html" rel="5263">NYSE:TWTR</a>) last year.</p>
<p>Candy Crush, where you sort sweets into lines, was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and generated the most revenue of any mobile app. As players progress through its levels they have to pay for add-ons and enhancements.</p>
<p>King was founded in 2003 by Zacconi and Toby Rowland, son of former Lonrho chief executive Roland “Tiny” Rowland and originally to supply online gaming products.</p>
<p>Since Candy Crush was launched in 2012, however, the game for the company has literally changed beyond all recognition. </p>
<p>King has other games, around 180 in total, but the bulk of its US$160mln profits and $600mln revenues in the final quarter of 2013 came from Candy Crush.</p>
<p>Zacchoni’s stake is now expected to be worth up US$750mln or even more when the shares start trading on 26 March.</p>
<p>The company will raise more than US$533 mln through the sale of 15.5mln shares, with 6.6mln to be sold by King employees and other shareholders. </p>
<p>King will be hoping to avoid the fate of Farmville originator of <a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/overviewOld/na/4532/Zynga" rel="4532">Zynga</a> (<a class="companyPopupTrigger" href="/companies/overview/4532/zynga-4532.html" rel="4532">NASDAQ:ZNGA</a>), the company behind Farmville, whose popularity waned, leading to falling player numbers and job losses, as well as a share price plunge.</p>
