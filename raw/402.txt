<p class="excerpt">Acquisition to boost companyâs position in key market</p>
<p>iNVEZZ.com, Monday, March 17: Vodafone Group Plc (LON:VOD) has agreed to buy Spainâs largest cable company Ono for â¬7.2 billion (Â£6 billion), including debt. The price tag implies a multiple of 10.4 times Ono's operating free cash flow, broadly in line with recent deals in the European cable and telecoms sector.</p>
<p>The worldâs second largest mobile phone company announced the move in a statement to the London Stock Exchange earlier this morning. In todayâs trading Vodafone shares were up 1.1 percent at 224.60p as of 9:16 UTC</p>
<p><strong>Highly attractive</strong></p>
<p>"The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone,â Vodafone chief executive officer Vittorio Colao commented in todayâs statement. </p>
<p>âWe look forward to welcoming the management and employees of Ono to Vodafone and working together to serve our customers across Spain," he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ono chairman JosÃ© MarÃ­a Castellano RÃ­os commented that the deal reflected his companyâs attractive position as âSpain's leading provider of high speed broadband, premium pay-TV and fixed communicationsâ.</p>
<p>Vodafone expects to see significant benefits from the acquisition. The UK company pointed out that Ono is a highly attractive standalone business and has the largest next-generation network in Spain, which covers 7.2 million homes across 13 of the countryâs 17 regions. It offers fixed and mobile communications and television services to approximately 1.9 million customers. Onoâs network provides broadband speeds of up to 200 Mb per second, significantly faster than competing cable companies in the country.</p>
<p>Last year Ono reported revenue of â¬1.6 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of â¬680 million.</p>
<p>Onoâs acquisition is also expected to provide a significant boost to Vodafoneâs âunified communications strategyâ in an important European market. The deal will allow the UK telecoms giant to take advantage on the rapid increase in adoption of unified communications products and services in Spain. The company also sees significant potential to accelerate growth by leveraging its extensive distribution and marketing capabilities and through cross-selling to each companyâs customer base. </p>
<p><strong>European assets</strong></p>
<p>The Ono deal represents a continuation of Vodafoneâs push to rebuild its European operations. Last year the company secured the acquisition of Germanyâs largest cable company, Kabel Deutschland, in a â¬7.5 billion deal. The British company said on Friday that the integration of its existing operations in Germany and Kabel would begin from April 1.</p>
<p>Deep-pocketed Vodafone has indicated that it plans to spend Â£25 billion of the Â£84 billion it generated from the sale of its stake in US company, Verizon Wireless, to invest in its core European networks.</p>
<p><strong>As of 9:02 UTC buy Vodafone shares at 224.00p</strong></p>
<p><strong>As of 9:02 UTC sell Vodafone shares at 223.90p</strong></p>
