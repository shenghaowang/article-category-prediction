<p> Italian banking giant UniCredit SpA (UNCFF.PK) on Tuesday reported a loss for the fourth quarter that widened from last year, reflecting a hefty goodwill impairment and additional loan loss provisions.</p>
<p>UniCredit's board of directors approved the company's new 2013-18 strategic plan, targeting a net profit of about 2 billion euros in 2014 that is expected to more than triple to 6.6 billion euros in 2018. </p>
<p>UniCredit's net loss for the fourth quarter widened to 14.98 billion euros  or $20.78 billion, from 553 million euros in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The company attributed the wider loss to one-time items, driven by revised macroeconomic assumptions and a tougher regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The latest quarter's results include impairment of goodwill and customer relationships of 9.3 billion euros, leading to the full write down of the goodwill allocated to Italy, CEE and Austria. The company noted that the remaining goodwill on its balance sheet of 3.5 billion euros was broadly in line with its 2004 level.</p>
<p>UniCredit also recorded additional loan loss provisions of 7.2 billion euros, leading to total loan loss provisions of 9.3 billion euros in the quarter. In addition, the company incurred restructuring costs of 699 million euros in the quarter.</p>
<p>However, total revenues for the quarter grew 5 percent to 5.98 billion euros from 5.68 billion euros in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Net interest income for the quarter edged up less than 1 percent from the year-ago period to 3.26 billion euros, reflecting continuous re-pricing on deposits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, commissions and fees rose 2 percent to 1.96 billion euros, aided by growth in investment service fees as well as financing service fees. Trading income surged 96 percent to 643 million euros, benefiting from gains on the sale of non-core equity investments.</p>
<p>Operating costs for the quarter rose 7 percent from the year-ago period to 3.88 billion euros.</p>

<p>Net write-downs on loans and provisions for guarantees and commitments more than doubled from last year to 9.34 billion euros, while provisions for risk and charges rose almost twelve-fold to 522 million euros.</p>
<p>UniCredit's assets under management or AUM were equal to 173.9 billion euros as at December 2013.</p>
<p>At the end of the fourth quarter, the company's Core Tier 1 ratio was equal to 11.11 percent, down from 11.44 percent in the same period last year.</p>
<p>UniCredit said that at the annual general meeting on May 13, 2014, its board of directors will propose a distribution of 10 eurocents per share for the financial year 2013, to be paid out of reserves of profits through a newly issued shares assignment.</p>
<p>However, upon shareholders' request, the company will make cash payment. The ex-dividend date has been set on May 19, 2014, with the record date May 21, 2014 and payment date on June 6, 2014.</p>
<p>UniCredit also announced the launch of its new 2013-18 strategic plan. The plan envisages reporting of the Italian non-core portfolio that is expected to be reduced by 63 percent in 2018.</p>
<p>Federico Ghizzoni, CEO of UniCredit said, "Whilst in 2014 we estimate a net profit around €2 billion, we intend to more than triple this to €6.6 billion in 2018, with an ROTE target of 13 per cent. We are also planning to invest €4.5 billion to grow revenues and to cut an additional €1.3 billion out of our cost base."</p>
<p>UniCredit said it has decided to make an initial public offering of Fineco during 2014 in order to accelerate its growth and enhance its market visibility, whilst optimizing capital allocation within the Group.</p>
<p>On the Milan Stock Exchange, UniCredit shares are currently trading at 6.40 euros, up 0.36 or 5.96 percent on a volume of 184.55 million shares. </p>
