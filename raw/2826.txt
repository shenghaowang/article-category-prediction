<p>The state collected more than $2m in recreational marijuana sales</p>
<p>Colorado collected almost two million dollars (£1.2 million) in taxes on cannabis in January, the first month where retail sales of the newly legalised drugs were allowed.</p>
<p>The figures indicate that the 59 firms selling the drug made about $14m (£8.4m) in gross sales that month.</p>
<p>Colorado became the first country to legalise cannabis in 2012, but commercial sale did not begin until 1 January 2014.</p>
<p>If medical marijuana stores are included, the state collected $3.5 million (£2.1 million) in taxes, intensifying the debate on how Colorado should spend the money.</p>
<p>In comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million (£1.6 million) in alcohol excise taxes in January last year.</p>
<p>Last week, Washington DC voted by an overwhelming majority to decriminalise the possession of marijuana and smoking it at home.</p>
<p>Governor John Hickenlooper has sent the legislature a detailed $134 million (£80 million) proposal for recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to children and more advertising to discourage driving while high on the drug.</p>
<p>Recently, the US President Barack Obama described cannabis use as "not very different from cigarettes” and no more dangerous than alcohol, while admitting he smoked marijuana when he was younger.</p>
<p>He instructed the Department of Justice to stop prosecuting banks who accepted business from firms selling cannabis. <a href="/news/world/americas/us-government-issues-cannabis-cash-guidelines-to-banks-9130548.html?origin=internalSearch">Many shops had been unable to gain access to banking services and have been forced to operate on a cash-only basis, without access to financial services or credit.</a></p>
<p>Mr Obama’s comments came after <a href="/news/world/americas/new-york-to-legalise-medical-use-of-marijuana-9039806.html">New York announced it would join 20 other states</a>, and Washington DC, in permitting the sale, possession and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.</p>
