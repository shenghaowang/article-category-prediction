<p data-page="1">CAIRO -- Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was ousted Tuesday in a parliamentary vote of no confidence on the heels of a confrontation with a breakaway militia that sought to bypass the weak government and sell oil on its own.</p>
<p>Lawmakers named the defense minister to act as prime minister until a replacement for Zeidan is found.</p>
<p>Zeidan had been struggling for months to keep control of a fractured and impotent central administration in the North African state, which faces growing chaos in the wake of <runtime:topic id="PEPLT000007572">Moammar Kadafi</runtime:topic>â€™s overthrow three years ago.</p>
<p>Rebel commanders have struck out on their own, with armed groups -- sometimes loosely affiliated with the government and drawing pay for that nominal alliance -- wielding far more power than the state.</p>
<p>Militias had seized control of crucial eastern oil ports months ago, and over the weekend moved for the first time to deal directly with would-be buyers. This week, a North Korean-flagged tanker took on a cargo of crude oil and sailed from the port of Es Sedr, with the militias defying government threats of attack.</p>
<p>Zeidan's government had ordered the military to block the tanker's departure, and subsequently claimed to have taken control of the vessel. Militias denied that had occurred.</p>
