<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">NEW YORK -- For much of Wednesday, the U.S. stock market appeared to be headed for its third decline in three days.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">By late afternoon, the market began to slowly pare its losses as investors bought up oil refiners, mining companies and technology stocks.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">The push was enough to nudge the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index into the green by half a point. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also finished higher.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">The S&amp;P 500 index added 0.57 points, or 0.03 percent, to close at 1,868.20. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,340.08.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">The Nasdaq composite rebounded in the early afternoon, gaining 16.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,323.33.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">The three major U.S. stock indexes are still down for the week. Investors have been worried about a sharp drop in China's exports reported over the weekend, which raised concerns that the world's second-largest economy is slowing. Some strategists say investors are pausing after the market hit three record highs last week.Stocks had a strong finish last week, setting three record highs.</p>
