<p>Retail giant Amazon has recently announced that their popular Prime service will increase in price from $79 to $99 a year in a controversial first price hike since the service was started nine years ago. Amazon justified the increase, claiming it was essential to compensate for the transportation and fuel costs in the free delivery of orders within two days.</p>
<p>Prime is one of several membership programs offered by Amazon. For a yearly membership fee of $79, users can get unlimited quick One-Day Delivery for qualified orders, cheaper rates on upgrades to Evening and Express Delivery, as well as access to movies, TV episodes and Kindle books.</p>
<p>A recent survey showed that 94 percent of users would want to renew their Prime membership at $79 but only 58 percent would renew their membership if the price was increased to $99.</p>
<p>Here are some additional ways for Amazon Prime members to enjoy benefits, available until March 20:</p>
