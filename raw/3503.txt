<p>A North Korean-flagged tanker laden with oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya slipped the warships deployed to intercept it and escaped to sea on Tuesday, MPs said.
<br/>The Morning Glory, which docked in Al-Sidra on Saturday and is reported to have taken on at least 234,000 barrels of crude, is the first vessel to have loaded oil from a rebel-held terminal since the revolt against the Tripoli authorities erupted last July.
<br/>The central government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the tanker getting away with its cargo of oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorisation of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation.
<br/>But members of the General National Congress, Libya's highest political authority, said that bad weather prevented the navy's small vessels from following the huge ship out into the Mediterranean.
<br/>"The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow," one GNC member said.
<br/>Abdelkader Houili, who sits on the GNC's energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that the navy's warships, which mainly consist of fast patrol boats, had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.
<br/>"The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea," he said.
<br/>The Morning Glory's escape is a new humiliation for the Tripoli authorities who have been battling to assert control over much of the country since the NATO-backed 2011 revolt that ended the 42-year dictatorship of Moamer Gathafi.
<br/>In eastern Libya in particular, a myriad of former rebel militias, Islamist as well as regionalist, have carved out their own fiefdoms.
<br/>There have been almost daily attacks on security and other government personnel in the region's main towns.
<br/>Former rebels calling for the restoration of the autonomy that Cyrenaica enjoyed for the first 12 years after Libyan independence in 1951, seized control of eastern export terminals last July.
<br/>They have made several attempts to export crude through their own oil company but the Morning Glory is the first to have successfully taken on crude.
<br/>"We are not demanding the breakup of the country," the head of the federalists' self-declared autonomous government, Abdrabbuh al-Barassi, said on Saturday.
<br/>"The oil revenues would be split between the three autonomous regions," he said, promising that all sales would be carried out with complete transparency.
<br/>But Washington said on Sunday that it was "deeply concerned" over the loading of "illicitly obtained" oil.
<br/>"This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
<br/>"The oil belongs to the Libyan National Oil Company and its joint venture partners."
<br/>Warships had deployed to block the Morning Glory after Culture Minister Amin al-Habib warned on Sunday the tanker would be "turned into a pile of metal" if it tried to leave port.
<br/>The GNC said a task force composed of both regular troops and ex-rebel militia was being formed to bring the rebel ports back under central government control within a week.
<br/>But analysts warned that any resort to force risked plunging Libya back into civil war and wreaking major damage to the country's key oil infrastructure.
<br/>The standoff between the Tripoli authorities and the eastern rebels has already slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5 million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country's key revenue earner.
<br/>The simmering tensions in Libya helped push up oil markets Tuesday with New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in April, gaining 19 cents to $101.31 a barrel.
<br/>"Libya continues to support prices as well, with the threat to sink a North Korean tanker if it loads oil from a rebel held port being taken seriously in the markets," said analyst Joe Conlan at energy consultancy Inenco.</p>
