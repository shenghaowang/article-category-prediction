<p>AUBURN HILLS (WKZO) -- Chrysler is recalling over 25-thousand Jeep and Dodge SUV’s because of a braking issue, even though there haven’t been any reports of accidents or injuries.</p>
<p>They plan to adjust and update software to improve the “feel” of the brake pedal during hard braking maneuvers.</p>
<p>Industry expert Katie Kerwin isn’t sure she has ever heard of a recall just to fix the “feel” of a vehicle but it makes sense in this case, because the feel of the brake could be critical in an emergency.</p>
<p>It has to do with the flow of the brake fluid through the system when the brake pedal is suddenly depressed.</p>
<p>Customers will be notified when it’s their turn for servicing. Chrysler will cover the cost.</p>
