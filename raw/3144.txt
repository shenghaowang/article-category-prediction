<p data-page="1">A month before he was a co-pilot in a bizarre plane disappearance, Malaysia Airlines pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid was happy to finally be getting his chance to fly a Boeing 777-200.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/08/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-first-officer/index.html" target="_blank">CNN aviation expert Richard Quest</a> had coincidentally filmed a training session for the 27-year-old co-pilot of the Malaysia Airlines flight that mysteriously vanished after taking off March 8 from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia en route to Beijing.</p>
<p>Hamid told Quest he had 2,700 hours of flight experience and was transitioning to a wider aircraft. When asked about flying, the young pilot told Quest simply that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7rWi4qU0yo" target="_blank">"just loved it."</a></p>
<p>"It was a wonderful experience, particularly flying the larger big triple 7 plane that we were onboard," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7rWi4qU0yo" target="_blank">he said.</a></p>
<p>Hamid was the far less experienced than his co-pilot in the doomed flight. In the training on Feb. 19 he flew with a training captain and flew the Boeing 777-200, the same type of aircraft that is now missing, from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Hamid had done extensive training in flight simulators and conducted a "textbook landing" on that day, according to his trainer, Quest said.</p>
<p>"It was interesting to watch the way he brought the aircraft in to land," Quest said.</p>
<p>Hamid joined the airline in 2007 and was flying with a much more experienced co-pilot Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, who began working for Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flying experience.</p>
<p>A story surfaced recently that Hamid and another co-pilot plucked two women from a 2011 flight and entertained them in the cockpit, posing for pictures and smoking cigarettes while flying.</p>
<p>"They were friendly â€¦ they were very competent in what they were doing," South African resident Jonti Roos told Australia's "A Current Affair," adding that in hindsight the whole experience was "possibly a little bit sleazy."</p>
<p>The massive search for the plane was suspended Sunday while Malaysian government officials tried to identify new areas to search.</p>
<p>There is no indication of when the search will resume.</p>
