<p class="speakable-paragraph">King Digital Entertainment, the Irish parent company of the mobile game Candy Crush Saga, has enjoyed massive and rapid growth thanks to its highly addictive digital offspring; in February alone, Candy Crush garnered 97 million daily active users and over 1 billion daily game-plays. According to an amended SEC filing released Wednesday, King wants those billions of games played to translate to billions of dollars in its upcoming initial public offering -- as much as $7.6 billion, in fact. But with a litter of once-hot (but now, not) apps in its wake -- see: Farmville, Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds, to name three -- the biggest question that remains is not if King Digital can reach its $7.6 billion target, but whether it can avoid the fate of Zynga, the mobile gaming company whose Farmville is among those apps that have faded from public memory and whose shares have fallen more than 40% since its IPO in 2011.</p>
<p>In an amended prospectus filed Wednesday morning, King revealed that it has applied to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "KING" at an expected price range of $21 to $24 per share. In the meantime, it is selling 22.2 million shares in its initial offering, a sale that would result in $532.8 million in raised funds if the shares are sold at the top of that price range. King expects to net a little less than the top end of the range, saying it expects to receive $326 million in net proceeds based on an assumed initial public offering price of $22.50 per ordinary share.</p>
<p>The offering of the 22.2 million shares leaves a little under 315 million shares outstanding, which if sold at $24 per share would give King its desired $7.6 billion valuation.</p>
<p>However, King's largest individual shareholders will need some market help if they want their own stakes to win them entry into the ten figure club. King chairman Melvyn Morris owns 35.6 million shares, an 11.3% stake that would be worth more than $854 million at the high end of the filed price range, while chief executive Riccardo Zacconi's 30 million-share stake, 9.6%, would be worth a little over $728 million. (Note that these share-ownership figures differ from King's original prospectus, filed in February, but the day after the original prospectus was filed King issued an automatic share conversion to convert the many different classes of its shares all into Class A stock, hence increasing shareholders' share counts.)</p>
<p>King's single largest shareholder, private equity firm Apax Ventures, will own a stake worth $3.83 billion if outstanding shares go for $24 a pop. The firm currently owns a 48% stake in the company but is accounting for 6.6 million of the 22.2 million shares up for grabs in the initial offering; even after the 6.6 million shares are sold, though, Apax will remain King's largest shareholder with a stake worth 44.8%.</p>

<p>In the SEC filing, CEO Zacconi lauded the health of his business, saying, "We have a substantial cash position and no debt, and we have been cash flow positive since 2005. Going public creates a liquid market for our current and future employees and equity holders and will give us greater flexibility to act on strategic opportunities if they arise in the future."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, risks abound -- especially for a company whose success hinges on the viral appeal of its mobile games. Many a comparison has been made to Zynga, the company behind the once-viral Farmville, a game that has largely faded from public memory. Zynga IPO'ed in 2011 with a $7 billion valuation, or $10 per share. The stock hit its peak -- $14.69 per share -- in February 2012, but has remained on a downward path ever since. Zynga currently trades around $5.80 a share, a more-than 40% decline from its stock market debut. Ironically, it was King's Candy Crush that ousted Farmville as the most-played app on <a data-ga-track="InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/facebook-ipo/" href="http://www.forbes.com/facebook-ipo/" target="_self">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>In its amended filing Wednesday, King acknowledged the risks, noting, "we have experienced significant rapid growth in our operations; a small number of games currently generate a substantial majority of our revenue; we face significant competition; if players do not find our casual game formats compelling and engaging, we could lose players and our revenue could decline; we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future results difficult to predict."</p>
