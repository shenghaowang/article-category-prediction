<p> Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has hinted that RBS would be forced to move its headquarters across the border if Scotland votes for independence this September. </p>
<p> Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney said the move would be "a distinct possibility", but backed away from saying outright that RBS would have to relocate. Under European laws banks are required to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices. </p>
<p> Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie pressed Mr Carney for a more specific answer, calling his response "a central bank phrase with a sort of layer of lawyer on top." However the Governor declined to add anything. </p>
<p> Mr Carney's comments come after UK banking giants Barclays and Lloyds said an independent Scotland would pose a risk to their businesses. </p>
