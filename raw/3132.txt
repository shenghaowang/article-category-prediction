<p>(Memphis) It's part of the latest push by the Obama Administration to get people to sign up for insurance.</p>
<p>Well known celebrities such as NBA legends Alonzo Mourning and Magic Johnson are appearing in ads to get people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, but are large numbers of Memphians enrolling?</p>
<p>The Church Health Center in Memphis provides affordable healthcare for the low-wage working, uninsured. Marvin Stockwell is communications director.</p>
<p>"The majority of our patients in Memphis won't receive a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act because Tennessee did not, at least so far, didn't expand its Medicaid plan," Stockwell said.</p>
<p>But according to a Bankrate.com report 41 percent of uninsured Americans plan to remain uninsured.</p>
<p>"Frankly, I think that's when we'll see more acceptance is when people begin hearing their friends have had a good experience. Why are people electing to stay uninsured? It has a lot to do with the affordability issue," Stockwell said.</p>
<p>The Bankrate.com report says more than 40 percent say health insurance is still too expensive and they'd rather pay a fine and many are still unaware of healthcare subsidies.</p>
<p>Christ Community Health Services also provides health care for Memphians and Shelby Countians who are uninsured.</p>
<p>Amanda Chandler is director of population health at Christ Community, "We've seen an increase since October since the opening of the Marketplace."</p>
<p>She says despite the media push, it's unfortunate many still have misconceptions about the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure why everyone would not be signing up for insurance. I think a lot of is just education that need to continue surround healthcare.gov," Chandler said.</p>
<p>Christ Community will offer a healthcare enrollment event March 25 at Greater Community Temple Church on Winchester from 11 a.m to 6 p.m.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that healthcare is so expensive that people have no choice but to stay uninsured and I think a lot of people are still unaware of what options are out there as an alternative. A friend showed me a book that I have found to be very helpful and it talks about how to find other types of affordable healthcare, how to pay directly for healthcare and gives practical advice. The book is called “The Self-Pay Patient” by Sean Parnell. His website, <a href="http://selfpaypatient.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selfpaypatient.com/</a>, is so worth checking out as it has a lot of helpful and useful information. I would definitely recommend checking it out since the deadline is quickly approaching.</p>
