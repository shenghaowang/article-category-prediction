<p>Correction: Virtu had posted one day of losses during the last five years, not the last four years, as an earlier version of this story stated.</p>
<p>It pays to be a high-frequency trading firm.</p>
<p>Virtu Financial Inc. filed preliminary papers to go public on Monday and revealed that it only had <a href='\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/story?guid=558407b4-7524-4b15-be1d-31fcdd08de76\"' target='\"_blank\"'>one day of trading losses in five years</a>.</p>
<p>The market maker states in its <a href='\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1592386/000104746914002070/a2218589zs-1.htm\"' target='\"_blank\"'>SEC filing</a> that one net trading loss occurred between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2013:</p>
<p>“As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days.”</p>
<p>Industry watchers say that this statistic is “incredible” and really speaks to the sophisticated and rigorous technology behind the high-frequency trading algorithms that Virtu is using.</p>
<p>“They have a smart approach and algorithms to try to minimize risk,” said Igor Gonta, who spent 13 years on Wall Street in commodities sales and trading and now runs <a href='\"http://www.marketprophit.com/\"' target='\"_blank\"'>Market Prophit</a>, a big data analytics firm involved in social media and stock sentiment.</p>
<p>The technology behind the high-frequency trading algorithms is only as good as the philosophical framework that goes into designing what the technology looks like, notes Gonta.</p>
<p>In the filing, Virtu said it had 2013 revenue of approximately $665 million, up 8% from the year before, and net income of $182 million, more than double from the year before.  The high-frequency trader is seeking a valuation of approximately $3 billion for its initial public offering, which is about twice that of its closest rival KCG Holdings Inc.

<p>Technology is very complex for these high-speed trading firms and providing liquidity and protecting shareholders is critical, as a small glitch can cost millions, experts say.</p>
<p>In 2012, Virtu tried to buy Knight Capital, another electronic market maker but was edged out by Getco LLC. Knight Capital became a target for a takeover after it <a href='\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/knight-capital-fined-12-mln-by-sec-2013-10-16\"' target='\"_blank\"'>experienced a technology glitch</a> which resulted in losses for the firm of more than $400 million.</p>
<p>“This is the uber version of a brokerage firm,” said Gonta. “Virtu does it in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the technology.”</p>
