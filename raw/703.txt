<p><span class="story_dl">LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- </span> British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.</p>
<p>European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption. With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis.<div class="ad_slot"><div class="story-offset"><div id="div-ad-inread"><script type="text/javascript">googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-ad-inread'); });</script></div></div>

<p>"Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance," he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday. "So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices."</p>
<p>European consumers get about a quarter of their gas needs met by Russia. Most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Davey said there was an increase in oil and gas prices on the international market in response to the row, which erupted in November when ousted Ukrainian President <a class="tpstyle" href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Viktor_Yanukovych/?tps=1" title="Viktor Yanukovych">Viktor Yanukovych</a> backed out of a trade deal with the European Union.</p>
<p>"They've now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices," he said.</p>
