<span class="photo-caption nointellitxt ctx_blocked">Candy Crush was the most downloaded free app of 2013 with 500 million downloads since its launch [GETTY]</span> </p>
<p class="storycopy">It will have a potential market value of £4.6billion, smashing earlier forecasts of £3billion, when it lists later this year, offering 22.2 million shares at between £12.60 and £14 each.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Co-founder and chief executive Riccardo Zacconi stands to make up to £448million from the float.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Candy Crush was the most downloaded free mobile app of 2013 and has been downloaded 500 million times since its 2012 launch. In 2011 King’s sales were £39million but had surged to £1.1billion by 2013. King is also profitable.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Yet none of King’s 180 games are as popular as Candy Crush and 95 per cent of revenues are generated by just three games.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Some analysts are therefore concerned that King is reliant on too small a selection of games.</p>
<p class="storycopy">In 2011, rival Zynga floated on the back of its hugely successful Farmville app but its value fell as it struggled to produce a similar scale hit.</p>
<p class="storycopy">King is backed by UK private equity firms Index Ventures and Apax.</p>
