<p>With two weeks left to register, officials said Monday that Obamacare signups now have hit the 5 million mark, perhaps putting enrollment goals within reach.</p>
<p>Marilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted the milestone on <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/blog/2014/03/marketplace-enrollment-hits-5-million.html">her blog</a> Monday.  Tavenner said the 5 million mark was reached over the weekend, a little less than three weeks after CMS officials announced on Feb. 25 they had reached 4 million enrollees.  That February mark was reached slightly more than one month after enrollment hit 3 million on Jan. 24.</p>
<p>With the March 31 deadline to enlist in Obamacare, the pace of enrollment clearly is quickening, putting new expectations of 6 million signups now in sight for the Affordable Care Act through public exchanges. The 6 million goal was lowered by the Congressional Budget Office from 7 million after difficulties with <a href="www.healthcare.gov">HealthCare.gov</a> prompted researchers to rethink the numbers.</p>
<p>A brisk campaign waged by President Obama along with members of his administration hopes to boost enrollment via either a handful of state-run exchanges or the federal HealthCare.gov site. Obama himself has made some unusual appearance in hopes of getting young adults to sign up.</p>
<p>The president last week showed up on the website <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/18e820ec3f/between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis-president-barack-obama">“Funny or Die”</a> with  Zach Galifianakis and traded a few barbs with the comic actor as he plugged his signature legislative achievement. Then he showed up on <a href="http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/webmd-interviews-obama">WebMD.com</a> to answer questions from readers.</p>
