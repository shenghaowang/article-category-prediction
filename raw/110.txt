<p>Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at $1,355 an ounce.</p>
<p>Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in four and a half months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal’s safe-haven appeal.</p>
<p>Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at $1,355 an ounce, traders said.</p>
<p>Other precious metals were higher too, with silver  climbing over one per cent.</p>
<p>“There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals,” said one Hong Kong-based precious metals. </p>
<p>“It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well,” he said.</p>
<p>“With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold’s downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets.” </p>
<p>Spot gold had gained 0.6 percent to $1,357.11 an ounce by 0309 GMT, after earlier hitting $1,359.25 – its highest since Oct. 29. The metal gained 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bullion has gained 13 per cent this year following a 28 per cent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world. </p>
<p>Ukraine’s government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise<br/>
rule from Moscow within days. </p>
<p>China’s first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Copper and iron ore prices have been hit the hardest.</p>
<p>In a sign of investor confidence in bullion, gold-backed exchange-traded products saw inflows of $500 million in February, a reversal from 13 consecutive months of outflows, according to BlackRock. </p>
<p><strong>PHYSICAL MARKETS</strong></p>
<p>Demand for physical bullion and jewellery has dropped off due to the jump in prices.</p>
<p>In China, the world’s biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20.  </p>
<p>Pakistan has extended its ban on gold imports to March 31, as it tries to stop smuggling to India where high import duties have made supplies scarce. </p>
