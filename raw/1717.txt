<p>The Chevrolet Cobalt is among the 2.6 million small cars affected by GM's ignition switch recall. </p>
<p><p>General Motors faced more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars Tuesday as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened probes into the matter.</p><p>The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.</p><p>Spokesmen for the Justice Department and GM would not comment. The investigation was first reported by <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade.
