<p>Following the MtGox Bitcoin exchange <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/03/mtgox-code-posted-by-hackers-as-company-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">losing millions to a hack</a> and filing for bankruptcy, anonymous attackers took over the personal blog and reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday. After seizing control, the hackers posted (<a href="http://pastebin.com/8gbUXLN3">Pastebin</a>) a message to the two spaces detailing their findings and the reasoning behind the attack. <div class="pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right"><div class="story-sidebar-part"><a aria-hidden="true" class="recommendation-further-reading story-sidebar-part-img" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/having-lost-463-million-in-bitcoins-mtgox-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/" role="presentation" style="background-image:url('https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10307490244_9960686147_b-300x150.jpg');" tabindex="-1"></a><div class="story-sidebar-part-content"><h3>Further Reading</h3><a class="recommendation-further-reading" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/having-lost-463-million-in-bitcoins-mtgox-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/">Having lost $468 million in bitcoins, MtGox files for bankruptcy protection</a></div></div></div></p>
<p>"It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities [sic] wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," the message reads. "This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data... <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included."</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/09/hackers-hit-mt-gox-exchanges-ceo-claim-to-publish-evidence-of-fraud/">Forbes</a> reports the 716 megabyte file placed on Karpeles' site included items like his home address, CV, and an Excel spreadsheet that seems to document more than a million trades. But the most interesting piece of information shared is a summary of 18 different currency balances—with 951,116 bitcoins listed. In light of the 850,000 bitcoins supposedly lost in the recent attack, the hackers concluded this figure demonstrates fraud. The footnote reads, "That fat fuck has been lying!!"</p>
<p>Despite the hack making noise around the Internet today, this leak is not yet guaranteed evidence of foul play. As Forbes notes, the balances could be a case of awful bookkeeping (it's not too far-fetched that MtGox was unaware of the hack for a while), and Karpeles has yet to return that site's request for comment.</p>
