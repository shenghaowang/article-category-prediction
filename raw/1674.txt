<p data-page="1">Starbucks customers using the company's iPhone app will be able to show some love to their baristas by tipping them through their smartphones starting March 19.</p>
<p>The Seattle coffee giant enhanced its mobile app for Apple's iOS system to allow digital tipping at more than 7,000 company-owned stores in the U.S. Customers will be able to tip 50 cents, $1 or a maximum of $2.</p>
<p>The company said the service was the upgrade most suggested by its customers online. Starbucks plans to rehash the Android version of its app later this year.</p>
<p>More than 11% of Starbucks purchases are made with a mobile device, the company said. Nearly 10 million patrons use the chain's mobile app.</p>
<p>Starbucks said it also spruced up other elements of its iPhone app, which allows for mobile payment, store locating and Starbucks Card reloading.</p>
<p>Customers now also have access to a function called "Shake to Pay." Shaking the smartphone pulls up the barcode of the customer's Starbucks Card, making for a faster mobile transaction.</p>
