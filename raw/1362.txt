<p style="font-size : 15px!important"> <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Pedestrians walk past an electronic board displaying stock prices in  Tokyo. Japan’s Nikkei share average yesterday slipped 153.93 points to  15,120.14 on weak trade data.</strong></span></p>

<p>Asian markets tumbled yesterday following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.</p>
<p>The losses came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the US, while investors are keeping an eye on events in Ukraine as leaders try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p>
<p>Tokyo slipped 1.01%, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93%, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03% lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.  Shanghai dived 2.86%, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75%, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.</p>
<p>Beijing said on Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98bn in February.  The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8bn in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $11.9bn surplus. Exports fell 18.1% and imports jumped 10.1%.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to ignore a number that looks like that,” said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.  Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2% in February, down from 2.5% in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.</p>
<p>While authorities blame the country’s holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness. The sell-off yesterday is “symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers”, he told Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p>In Japan the government said yesterday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2% in the quarter to December and 1.5% through 2013, slower than first thought.  Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3% in October-December period and 1.6% over the year.</p>
<p>While the data still marked Japan’s best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.</p>
<p>In currency trade the yen rose after seeing a sell-off for most of last week. In the afternoon the dollar fell to 103.15 yen from 103.24 yen in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>The euro fetched $1.3886 and 143.23 yen, against $1.3874 and 143.31 yen.</p>
<p>In Kuala Lumpur flag-carrier Malaysia Airlines lost 20% at one point after one of its 777 airliners went missing at the weekend with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. However, it clawed back a substantial part of that to sit 4% lower in late trade.</p>
<p>The broader market was down 0.50%.</p>
<p>Oil prices fell. New York’s main contract, West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, was down 13 cents at $102.45 and Brent North Sea crude for April fell 82 cents to $108.18.  Gold fetched $1,339.80 an ounce at 1200 GMT compared with $1,348.20 late Friday.</p>
<p>In other markets, Singapore closed down 0.31%, or 9.63 points, at 3,126.63, Bangkok edged down 0.44% or 6.03 points to close at 1,349.05, Jakarta ended down 0.18%, or 8.64 points, at 4,677.25, Kuala Lumpur dipped 0.56%, or 10.20 points, to 1,822.06, Taipei fell 0.56%, or 48.72 points, to 8,665.24, Wellington eased 0.15%, or 7.82 points, to 5,117.84 and Manila ended flat, edging up 5.40 points to 6,487.23.</p>
