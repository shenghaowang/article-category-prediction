<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="candy-crush IPO" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169772" height="525" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/candy-crush.jpg" srcset="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/candy-crush.jpg 700w, https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/candy-crush-300x225.jpg 300w" width="700"/></p>

<p>Both the recent surge in Facebook share price as well as the successful IPO of Twitter back in November of last year have fuelled speculation that a number of technology firms are considering filling for IPO in the near future.</p>
<p>Now King Digital Entertainment is hoping to take advantage of the strong demand for technology investments. However a company with only a couple of popular game titles to its name might end up being yet another Zynga.</p>
<p>King Digital Entertainment is scheduled to be priced on March 25th 2014 and the stock will start trading on March 26th, two underwriters have divulged to Reuters who explain’s:</p>
<p><em>“The Dublin-based company will sell 15.5 million shares in the offering, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7 million shares, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday</em></p>
<p><em>In February, an average of 144 million daily active users played the company’s games more than 1.4 billion times per day, the filing showed. The King IPO will raise as much as $532.8 million at the top-end of the planned range. It filed for a $500 million placeholder in February.”</em></p>
