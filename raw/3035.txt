                                   said its net loss for the fourth quarter was 15 billion euros ($20.79 billion), compared with 553 million euros for the same period of the previous year. </p>
<p>The bank, Italy’s largest lender by assets, opted to set aside 9.3 billion euros to cover bad loans in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.5 billion euros for the same period of the previous year, as it prepares for the review of its asset that the European Central Bank is carrying out before taking over supervision of the continent’s largest lenders. </p>
<p>The bank also wrote down the value of past acquisitions by 9.3 billion euros, which it said led to the full write-down of the goodwill allocated to Italy, Central and Eastern Europe and Austria. </p>
<p>The bank said the remaining goodwill on its balance sheet amounts to 3.5 billion euros, which is broadly in line with its 2004 level. </p>
<p>Gains in most revenue streams were in line with the corresponding quarter of the previous year. </p>
<p>The bank said its board approved a strategic plan that will drive the bank’s activity until 2018. It forecasts a net profit of 6.6 billion euros for 2018. </p>
<p>The firm also is planning to cut 8,500 jobs.</p>
