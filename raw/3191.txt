<p>Considerable weakness in the overseas markets is likely to weigh on the markets, with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day. </p>
<p>Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "With today's declines, most major European markets are at or below the closing lows of March 3rd, the Monday when markets finally reacted lower to Putin's war games."</p>
<p>"In Asia, the Shanghai, Hang Seng, Kospi, ASX, Singapore Straits and Japanese Topix are also at or near the March 3rd close but also are being influenced by China's growth concerns," he added.</p>
<p>While concerns about China and Ukraine are also likely to weigh on U.S. stocks, trading activity may be somewhat subdued amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.</p>
<p>Traders may continue to look ahead to the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices over the next two days.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, shares of Express (EXPR) are seeing significant weakness in pre-market trading after the apparel retailer reported weaker than expected fourth quarter results and provided disappointing first quarter guidance.</p>
<p>Russian mobile phone operator VimpelCom (VIP) may also come under pressure amid news the company is being investigated by U.S. and Dutch authorities in connection with its <span class="landLinks"><a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/Business.aspx">business</a></span> in Uzbekistan.</p>
