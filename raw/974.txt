<p>Colorado raked in about $2 million from taxes on recreational marijuana in just the first month since becoming legal in the state.</p>
<p>The tax total reported by the state Revenue Department indicates that $14.02 million worth of recreational <span>marijuana </span><span>was sold. The state collected about $2.01 million in taxes, the Associated Press <a href="https://bigstory.ap.org/article/colorado-collects-2m-recreational-pot-taxes" target="_blank">reported</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>State officials say the numbers were in line with what was expected.<br/></span></p>
<p>Colorado became the first state to permit the sale of recreational pot to anyone age 21 or older. Sales began Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Colorado voters approved last year a 15 percent excise tax, a 10 percent special sales tax and a 2.9 percent sales tax on recreational pot. They said that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go toward school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers, the AP said.</p>
