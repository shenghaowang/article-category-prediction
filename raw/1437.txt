<p>Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.<br/><br/>Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.<br/><br/>A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox's request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.<br/><br/>The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets.<br/><br/>Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.<br/><br/>Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.<br/><br/>The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.<br/><br/>Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.<br/><br/><div id="checked" style="display: none"><div id="adslotNativeVideo" style="text-align:center; padding-bottom:20px;"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("adslotNativeVideo"); });</script></div></div>In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.<br/><br/>Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.<br/><br/>Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/><br/>Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.<br/><br/>Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker &amp; McKenzie.<br/><br/><a class="showFilePanel" href="javascript:void(0);"><div class="comment_story"><span><em class="ndtv-detailp-comments-count"></em></span></div></a><em>Copyright: Thomson Reuters 2014</em></p>
