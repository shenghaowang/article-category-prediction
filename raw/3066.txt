<p>(CNN) — General Motors knew of an issue with its ignition switch several years before it has previously acknowledged knowing of a fault with that part.<br/>
The company said in a federal filing that surfaced Wednesday it discovered an issue with the Saturn Ion ignition switch in 2001 during pre-production. GM has previously said it first learned of ignition switch issues in 2004.<br/>
It wasn’t clear from the document if the issue discovered in 2001 was the same one that led to a recent recall of 1.4 million cars in North America. The issue cited in the recall has been tied to 13 deaths.</p>
