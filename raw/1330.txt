<p>U.S. Navy SEALs took control of a North Korea-flagged tanker that had loaded crude oil at a port held by rebels in eastern Libya, the Pentagon said in a statement on Monday, Al Arabiya reported.</p>
<p>According to the Pentagon, the move was made at "request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments."</p>
<p>No one was hurt "when U.S. forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement, reported by Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>The ship was boarded by the SEALs just after 0200 GMT Monday "in international waters southeast of Cyprus" following President Barack Obama approval of the operation.</p>
<p>The statement said the ship "is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra."</p>
<p>The Morning Glory, which departed from the eastern Libyan port of Al-Sidra -- controlled by rebels seeking autonomy from the authorities in Tripoli -- is reported to have loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude, according to Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pyongyang had "cancelled and deleted" the ship's North Korean registry, as it violated its law "on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo."</p>
<p>"Therefore, the ship has nothing to do" with North Korea, which "has no responsibility whatsoever as regards the ship," KCNA said.</p>
