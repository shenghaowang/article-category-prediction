<p id="bodyHolder_divSummary" style="text-align: left;">Satellite images on a Chinese government website show suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating off the southern tip of Vietnam, near the plane's original flight path, China's Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.<br/><br/>The revelation could provide searchers with a focus that has eluded them since the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard early Saturday.<br/><br/>No other governments have confirmed the Xinhua report, which did not say when Chinese officials became aware of the images and associated them with the missing plane.<br/><br/>The new Chinese reports of the satellite images came after several days of sometimes confusing and conflicting statements from Malaysian officials.<br/><br/>The Malaysian government said it had asked India to join in the search near the Andaman Sea, suggesting the jetliner might have reached those waters after crossing into the Strait of Malacca, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the flight's last-known coordinates.<br/><br/>Aviation officials in Vietnam said they never heard from the plane.<br/><br/>The alert says one airline found a 16-inch crack in one plane, then checked other 777s and found more cracking.</p>
