<p>The Mercedes B-Class was introduced nearly three years ago, so the company is preparing a minor facelift for the model.</p>
<p>Caught undergoing cold weather testing, the facelifted model appears to feature a new front bumper, a revised grille and restyled head and taillights. We can also see a new exhaust system that is better integrated into the rear bumper.</p>
<p>Our spies couldn't get close enough to snap interior photo<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">s but the car is expected to feature minor changes and an</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Â updated infotainment system.</span></p>

<p>The facelifted B-Class could be introduced later this year, so look for a possible debut at the Paris Motor Show.</p>
