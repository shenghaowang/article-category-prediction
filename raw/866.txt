  U.S. investigators think the missing Malaysia Airlines plane most
  likely flew <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-16/malaysia-appeals-to-15-nations-to-aid-in-wider-search-for-plane.html">
  southwest over the Indian Ocean off Western Australia</a>,
  Bloomberg reports citing two officials.
</p>
<p>
  Satellite data showed that the plane likely flew either on that
  route or <a href="http://keithledgerwood.tumblr.com/post/79838944823/did-malaysian-airlines-370-disappear-using-sia68">
  northwest toward Kazakhstan</a>. The latter seems less likely
  since the plane would have flown through the airspace of multiple
  countries.
</p>
<p>
  Experts agree that there’s a good chance MH370 will never be
  found if it’s gone into a deep and remote part of the Indian
  Ocean.
</p>
<p>
  Australia today took charge of the search in the Indian Ocean.

  parliament</a> Australia would coordinate operations in the
  vast search area to its west.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Abbott spoke to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak today. “I
  offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime
  surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted,” he said.
</p>
<p>
  Defence Force chief General David Hurley had been in touch with
  his Malaysian counterpart to discuss how additional resources
  could be used.
</p>
<p>
  Australia has two P-3 Orion surveillance planes on the search and
  are reportedly looking around the Cocos islands about 2,000
  nautical miles northwest of Perth.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Abbott said: “We will do our duty to ensure that our search
  and rescue responsibilities are maintained and upheld and we will
  do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft
  who are still absolutely devastated by their absence and who are
  still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed
  mystery.”
