In a note, analysts at Danske Bank said the data suggests the economy is slowing faster than expected, and the slowdown in industrial production suggests growth in gross domestic product could drop below the government’s 7.5% target as soon as the first quarter. <a class="icon " href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/13/faber-sees-china-growth-at-4-good-news-for-its-gigantic-bubble/?link=instory" target="_new">Faber sees China growth at 4% -- good news for its ‘gigantic’ bubble</a></p>

He also acknowledged that defaults of some financing vehicles may be inevitable, but the government would closely monitor the situation.</p>
<p>Some said Shanghai stocks were also boosted by media reports that China’s securities regulator may allow companies to issue preferred shares within the first half of the year, as it works to try to deliver market-boosting measures to lift confidence in the battered market. </p>
