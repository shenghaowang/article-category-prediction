<p>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (é¿éå·´å·´), Chinaâs biggest e-commerce company, will begin the process of filing for an initial public offering in the US that may be the biggest since Facebook Inc.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after Alibaba struggled to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve a proposed governance structure that would allow its partners to nominate a majority of its board of directors. The company is open to listing in China âshould circumstances permit in the future,â the company said.</p>
<p>Investment banks have valued Alibaba, founded by former English teacher Jack Ma (é¦¬é²), at as much as US$200 billion, which would make it the second-biggest Internet company behind Google Inc based on market capitalization. A US share sale by Alibaba would be a blow to Hong Kong, which has not hosted an IPO of more than US$4 billion since October 2010.</p>
<p>âAlibaba from day one has been based around making money, and itâs a real Chinese Internet success story,â said Mark Tanner, the founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. âAlibaba is huge now, but will just continue to get a lot bigger.â</p>
<p>The IPO is codenamed âAvatar,â two people familiar with the matter have said.</p>
<p>An Alibaba IPO could raise about HK$100 billion (US$12.9 billion), Ernst &amp; Young LLP said on June 28 last year. That would make it the worldâs biggest first-time share offering since Facebook raised US$16 billion in May last year, and Hong Kongâs largest since AIA Group Ltdâs US$20 billion sale in October 2010, Bloomberg data showed.</p>
<p>Alibabaâs expansion since Ma started the company in his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with two dozen items for sale, mirrors Chinaâs emergence as an economic superpower.</p>
<p>The company had about 25,000 employees at the end of last month and generated about 70 percent of package deliveries in China in 2012. Customers bought 35 billion yuan (US$5.7 billion) of goods on one sales promotion day via Alibabaâs two main platforms last year.</p>
<p>The success has made Ma, 49, one of Chinaâs richest people, with an estimated net worth of US$11.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p>
<p>There is still room for growth. China has 618 million Internet users, greater than the population of any other country except India, and McKinsey &amp; Co estimates Chinaâs Internet retail market will triple to US$395 billion from 2011 to next year.</p>
<p>Analyst valuations of Alibaba rose 28 percent after the earnings, with the company worth US$153 billion, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News last month.</p>
<p>Macquarie Group Ltd estimated Alibaba could be worth US$200 billion, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a Jan. 29 report put the companyâs value at about US$150 billion.</p>
<p>Google has a market capitalization of US$400 billion, Amazon US$171 billion and Facebook, US$175 billion, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
