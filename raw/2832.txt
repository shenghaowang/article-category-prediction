<p>Ono is the second-largest provider of broadband internet, pay television and fixed services in Spain, a market in which Vodafone has seen a reduction in both mobile customer numbers and earnings in recent years.</p>
<p>Vodafone Group chief executive Vittorio Colao, said:</p>
<p>The combination of Vodafone and Ono creates a leading integrated communications provider in Spain and represents an attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone.</p>
<p>Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction - together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme - will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.<div id="tpd-box-ad-bm">

<p>Vodafone made an earlier offer of around €7bn that was rejected but following resumed negotiations Vodafone raised its bid to between €7.2bn and €7.3bn.</p>
<p>On Friday Vodafone and Ono reached an agreement in principle and both sides raced over the weekend to finalise the deal.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Vodafone to add Ono’s pay-TV and fixed line services to its mobile offering, positioning it as a so-called quad play provider in the Spanish market, as well as allowing it to reduce the costs of carrying calls on its mobile network around the country.</p>
<p>Until Friday Ono’s shareholders – including investment funds Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H Lee Partners and Quadrangle Capital – had been looking for an exit by a floating the company on the Madrid stock exchange. The takeover fits with Vodafone’s strategy of spending up to £25bn, generated from the £84bn sale of its stake in <a href="http://www.cityam.com/company/verizon">Verizon</a> Wireless, to invest in its core European networks.</p>
