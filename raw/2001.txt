<p>Premier Li Keqiang says China can accommodate economic growth lower than its stated target of 7.5 per cent and signalled the government is comfortable with the "hardly avoidable" prospect of debt defaults within the nation's risky shadow banking sector.</p>
<p>Speaking at the closing press conference of the National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday, China's No.2 leader said he was confident in the health of the country's economy, and that bearish talk of a 'hard landing' had consistently been proven wrong.</p>

<p>Mr Li conceded the "downward pressure" on the economy was the toughest challenge he faced last year, and said the challenge may prove even harder this time round as China continues to push through a painstaking restructuring of its economy.</p>
<p>"There is no denying we may encounter a more complex situation this year," he said, raising the difficult balancing act of maintaining jobs growth, keeping inflation in check, alleviating environmental problems, all while improving the efficiency and quality of China's economic growth.</p>
<p>"We need to strike a proper balance among all these goals and objectives."</p>
<p>Mr Li also ruled out pumping short-term financial stimulus into the economy to artificially inflate growth.</p>
<p>"Without taking any additional short term stimulus measures we succeeded in meeting our [economic growth] targets last year," he said. "Why can't we do that this year?"</p>
<p>He said despite some domestic resistance, Chinese banks would not get a lower reserve requirement ratio to allow more credit to flow into the market.</p>
<p>"This is a must for us," he said. "We do not want to let today's stepping stone become tomorrow's stumbling block."</p>
<p>Weak Chinese economic data has triggered steep falls in iron ore and copper prices this week, amid heightened concerns about financial stresses in China's so-called shadow-banking sector, and reports of steel mills struggling to repay their debts.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, China released data showing industrial production grew at its slowest pace for more than four years during January and February, while retail sales and fixed asset investment were significantly lower than expected.</p>
<p>Iron ore prices have dropped 10 per cent in the past week on fresh fears of weakening Chinese demand and tighter credit conditions in an already cash-strapped domestic steel industry.</p>
<p>"Heightened speculative activity in Chinese steel prices has accentuated the iron ore price declines and while sentiment remains weak, we can't discount further price falls," ANZ's head of commodity strategy, Mark Pervan, said in a research note.</p>
<p>Chinese retail investors have in recent years piled into wealth management products that fund borrowers the nation's banks shy away from.</p>
<p>Chinese retail investors have in recent years piled into its so-called shadow banking sector, including higher-return wealth management products that fund borrowers the nation's banks shy away from.</p>
<p>One reason the country's $1.2 trillion trust market has grown so large is a widespread belief the government and state-run banking sector will not allow the companies whose loans back the wealth products to fail.</p>
<p>But in January, a Chinese financial trust product narrowly avoided default when it was bailed out at the last minute, avoiding what some western analysts had feared could have triggered a Lehman Brothers-like domino effect on the global economy.</p>
<p>Mr Li said while China paid "very high attention to financial and debt risks" he believed defaults were probably unavoidable, but that it was unlikely to result in "regional and systemic" risks.</p>
<p>"How can I possibly want to see such defaults?" he said. "But I'm afraid that some individual cases of such defaults are hardly avoidable."</p>
<p>"What we should do is to step up monitoring, handle matters in time, and ensure that there are no regional and systemic financial risks."</p>
<p>In his first government work report delivered to the NPC as Premier last week, Mr Li said China would aim for economic growth of "about 7.5 per cent", which prompted some analysts to express concern that China was not determined enough to sacrifice short term economic growth in order to push through reforms that will help restructure the economy away from its current over-reliance on investment and credit.</p>
<p>"The 'about' shows there's a level of flexibility here," Mr Li said on Thursday, while declining to provide what he believed was a lower threshold of acceptable growth. While he said the focus of the Chinese government was to improve the quality of economic development rather than growth for growth's sake, he said the GDP figures needed to provide for an additional 16 million to 17 million jobs per year.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Lou Jiwei has also previously indicated that economic growth of 7.2 per cent or 7.3 per cent would be acceptable, as long as unemployment didn't spike.</p>
<p>"What we care more about is the livelihood of our people behind the GDP growth figure, and the employment of people behind GDP growth," Mr Li said.</p>
