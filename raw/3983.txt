<p>Investing.com - European stocks were steady in choppy trade on
Thursday, as the release of disappointing economic reports out of
China dampened market sentiment and as the European Central Bank's
latest policy move continued to weigh.</p>

France's CAC 40 added 0.02%, while Germany's DAX 30 inched up
0.04%.</p>
<p>Investors remained cautious after data showed that Chinese
industrial production rose 8.6% in the first two months of 2014,
missing market expectations for an increase of 9.5%, while Chinese
retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same
period.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>The data added to concerns over the strength of the world's
second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Meanhile, European equities remained under pressure after the
European Central Bank's decision last week to refrain from
implementing policy measures to shore up growth in the euro area,
despite forecasting low inflation for some years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking Wednesday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble
said interest rates in the euro zone are too low from a German
point of view. He also said he doesn't expect deflation to

<p>Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders BNP
Paribas and Societe Generale fell 0.12% and 0.50%, while Germany's
Deutsche Bank declined 0.72%.</p>
<p>Among peripheral lenders, Spanish banks Banco Santander and BBVA
eased 0.06% and 0.21%. Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit
overperformed however, rising 0.13% and 0.50% respectively.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bouygues shares were down 1.26% after the company
raised the cash component of its offer for Vivendi's French phone
unit SFR to €11.3 billion to top a competing bid from cable

<p>In London, FTSE 100 dipped 0.05%, led by Morrison, down 9.10%,
after the U.K. grocer said profit will plunge this year and pledged

0.29% and the Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 0.52%, while HSBC
