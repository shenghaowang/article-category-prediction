<p> <strong>16.42 </strong>German Chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel </strong>has said she was "extraordinarily impressed" by Portugal's reform efforts as she met the bailed-out eurozone country's prime minister. </p>
<p> Merkel told a joint press conference with Prime Minister <strong>Pedro Passos Coehlo </strong>in Berlin that Portugal had undergone a drastic reform process that had placed a heavy burden on its people. </p>
<p> She said: </p>
<p> <i><img align="left" alt="Quote" height="40" src="https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01817/quotes_1817837a.gif" width="45"/> One can say today that growth can be seen, that the economic data have strongly improved, and very positively point to the future. </i> </p>
<p> <i>That's also being seen in the development of interest rates for government bonds. </i> </p>

<p> The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to move off its current course of steadily tapering its stimulus program in the two-day meeting in Washington. </p>
<p> And it will not begin raising the short-term fed funds rate from its bottom-level 0-0.25pc, where it has been since late 2008. </p>

<p><h3 class="was-h3"> <strong>Break in at EDF's nuclear plant in France </strong> </h3></p>
<p> <strong>14.56 </strong>Dozens of <strong>Greenpeace activists have sneaked in to France's oldest nuclear plant, run by EDF</strong>, to highlight alleged security weakness at atomic facilities. </p>
<p> Roughly 60 activists broke into the Fessenheim plant in eastern France near the border with Germany and Switzerland and hung a banner reading "Stop risking Europe" on the side of one of its reactors. </p>
<p> Greenpeace said the action was to <strong>"denounce the risk of French nuclear power for the whole of Europe"</strong>. </p>
<p> A spokesman for EDF said it was "functioning normally" despite the break-in that ended late afternoon. </p>
<p> EDF will run Britain's first nuclear plant to open in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset. </p>
<p> EDF has proposed that the new plant would consist of two 'European Pressurised Water’ reactors, each with a capacity of 1.6GW. </p>
<p> The plant would generate about 7pc of the UK’s electricity needs, enough to power about 5m homes, and should keep generating power for 60 years. </p>

<p> <strong>14.37 </strong>Having slipped in early trading, European markets are now on the rise following Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech in the Duma and signed a treaty with Crimean leaders on the strategic Black Sea peninsula becoming part of Russia. </p>
<p> Markets appeared soothed by his words that Crimea "was always Russian", which will no doubt infuriate the West. </p>
<p> Alexandre Baradez, an analyst at IG France said Putin was "less vindicative than expected, in particular less isolationalist, and the desire he indicated to maintain ties to the West without a doubt gave a boost to indices." </p>
<p> Trader David White told <i>AFP </i>that "equities are making a tentative move higher on news that Mr Putin, for now, does not intend to carve up any more of Ukraine, putting both ease and money back into risk assets." </p>
<p> London's <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>rose 0.32pc from Monday's close to 6,589.42 points, Frankfurt's<strong> DAX 30</strong> added 0.59pc to 9,234.76 points and the Paris <strong>CAC 40</strong> climbed 0.96pc to 4,313.13 compared. </p>

<p> The share bonuses are about £8m lower than last year’s awards, though the 2013 figure was inflated by a close to £18m handout to Rich Ricci, the former chief executive of the investment banking division who left Barclays last year. </p>
<p> In total, the 12 Barclays executives received share worth £31.8m but immediately sold about half of their awards to pay the tax due on the bonuses. </p>
<p> Following these sales, Mr Jenkins retained a holding in Barclays shares worth £9.2m based on the bank’s market share price of 232.59p at the time the bonuses were granted. </p>

<p> <strong>10.49 </strong>Investment sentiment in Germany has hit its lowest level in seven months this month amid uncertainty about the fallout for Europe's top economy from the crisis in Crimea. </p>
<p> the widely watched investor confidence index calculated by the<strong> ZEW economic institute</strong> fell by 9.1 points to 46.6 points in March, its <strong>lowest level since August 2013. </strong> </p>
<p> ZEW president <strong>Clemens Fuest</strong> said: </p>

<p> In a statement from the IMF on Ms Shafik's departure it said she oversaw much of the Fund’s country work in Europe, including the programs with Greece and Portugal, as well as Arab countries in transition. She also led the efforts to integrate the Fund’s work on capacity building and technical assistance. </p>
<p> Shafik is stepping down as deputy MD immediately but will stay on until mid-June as Special Advisor to managing director Christine Lagarde </p>
<p> Shafik joined the Fund as Deputy Managing Director in April 2011 after resigning her position as Permanent Secretary of the UK Department for International Development. </p>
<p> She has a M.Sc. in Economics from the London School of Economics and a D.Phil. in Economics from Oxford University, she has also served as the youngest ever Vice President at the World Bank. </p>

<p> <strong>10.15 </strong>The full story of those new Bank of England appointments is now live. </p>

<p> Ms Shafik - known by her nickname Minouche - has served as a deputy managing director of the IMF since April 2011 - where she oversees work on<strong><i> </i></strong>countries in Europe and the Middle East. </p>
<p> The new post has been created to “conduct a root-and-branch review of how [the Bank] conducts market intelligence,” Governor Mark Carney told MPs last week. Ms Shafik also joins at a difficult time for the Bank, which this month suspended one of its employees amid allegations that the central bank was involved in the rigging of the foreign exchange market. </p>

<p> <strong>09.29 </strong>New car registrations in the European Union - a key indicator of economic health - rose in February, industry data showed Tuesday, but still remained close to a historic low. </p>
<p> The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said that demand for cars in the 27 EU countries it surveys (Malta is not included) <strong>rose by 8pc</strong>, the sixth consecutive gain. </p>
<p> However, the overall total of cars registered (861,058) was the second-lowest result for February since ACEA started collected EU-wide data in 2003. </p>
<p> The car sector in countries still recovering from the eurozone crisis generally fared better than others, with <strong>Spain</strong> showing a 17.8pc rise in new registrations and <strong>Italy</strong> up 8.6pc. </p>
<p> Eurozone powerhouse <strong>Germany</strong> reported a 4.3pc rise but Europe's second-largest economy <strong>France was the only major nation to experience a decline, </strong>with new registrations down 1.4pc on the month. </p>
<p> Europe's biggest carmaker <strong>Volkswagen</strong> showed an 8pc gain but Asian manufacturers were the main drivers of demand. </p>
<p> <strong>Toyota</strong> registrations were up 16.2pc, <strong>Suzuki</strong> up 33.1pc and <strong>Mitsubishi</strong> up 25.3pc. </p>

They told clients: </p>
<p> Sainsbury's long-standing record of positive like-for-like sales has come to an abrupt end with its Q4 2013/14 trading update that is a little worse than our downbeat expectations. Such a performance will be a particular disappointment to outgoing CEO, Justin King CBE, and perhaps more of a concern and worry to his replacement, Mike Coupe, and the group's shareholders. </p>
<p> Overall, the FTSE 100 is off 12 points at 6,555 with Ukraine still dominating the agenda. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at broker Interactive Investor, said: </p>
<p> <i><img align="left" alt="Quote" height="40" src="https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01817/quotes_1817837a.gif" width="45"/> The current limited action imposed on Russia does not appear to have had a major impact on investor sentiment yet, with investors relying on the idea that self-interest in Europe will prevent the threat of more aggressive sanctions. </i> </p>
<p> <i>However, the major issue is not Crimea, but the potential for further fallout in mainland Ukraine, with a breakup in the east of the country a real possibility. Putin's speech this morning will be closely watched, but if he continues to take a hard line on the matter, investor optimism that the issue is resolved may be misplaced.</i> </p>
<p> <strong>Asos plunges 19pc</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>08.38 </strong>Following those results from the online retailer (see 08.13), shares in ASOS have plunged 18.6pc in early trading this morning. </p>
<p> Sainsburys is fairing better - shares had slipped 1.6pc when markets opened but have regained some of the losses and are now down 0.9pc. </p>

<p> Frankfurt's <strong>DAX</strong> <strong>30</strong> dipped 0.1pc to 9,172.05 points and in Paris the <strong>CAC 40</strong> slid 0.18pc to 4,264.42. </p>

<p> <strong>Asos</strong> continues to cement its position as one of British retail's big winners. The online fashion retailer has reported a 21pc jump in revenues in the past two months, taking its sakes to £182m for the past six months, up 32pc from last year. The group now has 8.2m customers - a 36pc rise from last year, more than half of whom are international buyers. Even so, Nick Roberterson has warned that Asos's earning margin with be reduced this year to about 6.5pc due to investments in warehousing in the UK and Germany and its new venture in China. </p>
<p> <strong>Berkeley Group</strong> has once again credited George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme with its continuing strong growth. In a trading update, the housebuilder has said it anticipates completing 30pc more houses this year than at the peak of the market in 2007. Cash on forward sales has risen to £1.9bn from £1.75bn in October, reflecting particularly strong demand in London and the South East. </p>
<p> In a preliminary statement, <strong>Cairn Energy</strong> has reported post-tax losses of $556m, down from a profit of $73m last year. </p>
<p> <strong>Rank Group </strong>has announced the resignation of Colin Child, its senior independent director, with immediate effect after just two years on the board. </p>

The drop in sales ends a run of 36 consecutive quarters of sales growth under chief executive Justin King. </p>
<p> The Sainsbury's boss said the overall grocery industry is growing at the slowest pace since 2005, with shoppers enjoying a slowdown in food inflation. </p>
<p> Mr King said: Although some economic indicators are showing an improvement in the health of the economy, we expect the outlook for customers to continue to be challenging for the coming year. </p>
<p> "We remain confident that our differentiated offer, supported by 'value for values', Nectar data and Brand Match, will allow us to outperform our peers in the year ahead." </p>

<p> <strong>07.45 </strong>Asian markets rose in Tuesday's trading following a Wall Street rally as traders shrugged off growing tensions between the West and Russia following Crimea's vote for Kremlin rule. </p>
<p> After the weekend vote, the result of which was widely expected, attention turned to economic matters. Better than expected US data provided support as investors await the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting. </p>
<p> <strong>Tokyo</strong> rose 0.94pc, or 133.60 points, to 14,411.27, <strong>Seoul</strong> added 0.66pc, or 12.68 points, to close at 1,940.21 and <strong>Sydney</strong> advanced 0.51pc, or 27.0 points, to 5,344.6. </p>

<p> <strong>Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, will deliver the annual Mais Lecture today </strong>when he will discuss his plans to overhaul the Bank’s operations. </p>
<p> The Governor is expected to ask Bank staff to work across its different committees and allocate more resources to its forecasting. </p>
<p> Last week he told MPs the shake up was needed in the wake of allegations about manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. A new deputy governor is also expected to be announced. Mr Carney is due to speak at 6pm and is holding a press conference at 7pm. </p>
<p> The Treasury Select Committee is holding a one-off session on the performance of the Royal Mint. In Europe, Angela Merkel is meeting Pedro Passos Coelho, the Portugeuse prime minister, in Berlin.
