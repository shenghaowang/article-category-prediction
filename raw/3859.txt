<p>At least two states are re­quest­ing a longer Obama­care en­roll­ment peri­od—and they might get it.</p>
<p>The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion has been very clear that the en­roll­ment dead­line for health in­sur­ance pur­chased on the ex­changes is March 31, and that it doesn’t think it has the au­thor­ity to ex­tend it. But be­cause some con­sumers con­tin­ue to have trouble sign­ing up, of­fi­cials are eye­ing a “spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od” that would vir­tu­ally ex­tend the dead­line to get cov­er­age.</p>
<p>Nevada and Ore­gon hope to qual­i­fy for one of the health law’s spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­ods. Con­sumers in both states have faced tech­nic­al is­sues in get­ting cov­er­age: Ore­go­ni­ans still don’t have a func­tion­ing on­line ex­change, and Nevadans are re­ceiv­ing er­ror mes­sages and hit­ting oth­er site glitches re­min­is­cent of <em>Health­Care.gov</em>‘s early days.</p>
<p>Just un­der 39,000 Ore­go­ni­ans and 29,000 Nevadans had suc­cess­fully se­lec­ted a plan as of March 1, ac­cord­ing to data from the Health and Hu­man Ser­vices De­part­ment—few­er than 1.6 per­cent of all Obama­care en­rollees na­tion­wide.</p>
<p>State ex­change of­fi­cials have reached out to HHS to re­quest per­mis­sion to ex­tend the en­roll­ment peri­od. Ore­gon ex­change spokes­wo­man Ariane Holm said the state is seek­ing an ex­ten­sion through the end of April. Nevada is look­ing at up to 60 days, as per­mit­ted by law.</p>
<p>Nich­olas Bagley, a health law pro­fess­or at the Uni­versity of Michigan Law School, <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/how-the-administration-could-extend-open-enrollment-without-congressional-action/">wrote a post</a> on the “con­sid­er­able dis­cre­tion” HHS has in grant­ing spe­cial-en­roll­ment peri­ods for <em>The In­cid­ent­al Eco­nom­ist</em>, an eco­nom­ics and health blog. HHS, he said, has the leg­al au­thor­ity to grant spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­ods for con­sumers who had tried to get cov­er­age but could not.</p>
<p>HHS of­fi­cials have avoided re­peated ques­tions about wheth­er a state could qual­i­fy for a spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od and em­phas­ized that con­sumers should sign up by March 31, the end of open en­roll­ment.</p>
<p>But the ad­min­is­tra­tion has already made some tweaks to that dead­line, and it wouldn’t be un­char­ac­ter­ist­ic to grant lee­way to con­sumers who tried but could not get cov­er­age, giv­en the num­ber of changes made last Decem­ber in try­ing to get people in­sured who wanted cov­er­age be­gin­ning Jan. 1. And just Fri­day, of­fi­cials an­nounced con­sumers with ser­i­ous ill­nesses covered un­der the law’s Pre-ex­ist­ing Con­di­tion In­sur­ance Pro­gram can now se­lect a new ex­change plan through April 15.</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journ­al</em> also <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303546204579439633528430154">re­por­ted Sunday</a> that fed­er­al of­fi­cials are work­ing on a plan to al­low con­sumers who tried but failed to get through <em>Health­Care.gov</em> by March 31 to sign up after the dead­line.</p>
<p>Ore­gon of­fi­cials, <em>The Ore­go­ni­an</em> <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/03/with_march_31_health_coverage.html">re­por­ted late last week</a>, are hop­ing for a sim­il­ar re­prieve for the state’s res­id­ents.</p>
<p>And in Nevada, the <em>Las Ve­gas Sun</em> <a href="http://lasvegassun.com/news/2014/mar/13/nevada-board-delays-vote-special-enrollment/">re­ports</a>, the state is already mak­ing uni­lat­er­al moves to set up a spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od. It’s un­clear wheth­er Nevada has the au­thor­ity, giv­en that HHS has not is­sued guidelines for how the spe­cial-en­roll­ment peri­ods would work, but the board of dir­ect­ors of Nevada’s ex­change has a vote sched­uled Thursday on the mat­ter.</p>
<p>"Saudi Arabia said Saturday that Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi journalist who disappeared more than two weeks ago, had died after an argument and fistfight with unidentified men inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Eighteen men have been arrested and are being investigated in the case, Saudi state-run media reported without identifying any of them. State media also reported that Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, the deputy director of Saudi intelligence, and other high-ranking intelligence officials had been dismissed."</p>
<p>"Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is scrutinizing how a collection of activists and pundits intersected with WikiLeaks, the website that U.S. officials say was the primary conduit for publishing materials stolen by Russia, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mueller’s team has recently questioned witnesses about the activities of longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone, including his contacts with WikiLeaks, and has obtained telephone records, according to the people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings on core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections ... Specifically, Mueller is close to rendering judgment on two of the most explosive aspects of his inquiry: whether there were clear incidents of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and whether the president took any actions that constitute obstruction of justice." Mueller has faced pressure to wrap up the investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said an official, who would receive the results of the investigation and have "some discretion in deciding what is relayed to Congress and what is publicly released," if he remains at his post.</p>
<p>"The Justice Department on Friday charged a Russian woman for her alleged role in a conspiracy to interfere with the 2018 U.S. election, marking the first criminal case prosecutors have brought against a foreign national for interfering in the upcoming midterms. Elena Khusyaynova, 44, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Prosecutors said she managed the finances of 'Project Lakhta,' a foreign influence operation they said was designed 'to sow discord in the U.S. political system' by pushing arguments and misinformation online about a host of divisive political issues, including immigration, the Confederate flag, gun control and the National Football League national-anthem protests."</p>
