<p>At an evening press conference in Kuala Lumpur, early morning on the US East Coast, Malaysia's Acting Minister of Transportation defended his country's handling of the disappearance of the Boeing 777 aircraft, claiming it needed to verify information before sharing it with the international community to avoid expending assets inappropriately. The official stated that 26 countries are now assisting in the search with countries in the flight corridors being asked to provide radar and satellite data for analysis and aircraft and ships for the physical search.  Other countries like China and  France are being asked for technical assistance.  The Malaysian official claimed that US investigators have been involved from the beginning, including the FBI.</p>
<p>Malaysia's recent efforts to involve the international community are a welcome development but their delay may come at a high price, both in terms of delay in finding the aircraft and needless expenditure of assets tracking down incorrect information.  For example, substantial assets were expended searching the intended flight path between Malaysia and Vietnam when Malaysian authorities had radar data showing the 777 had flown to across Malaysia and towards the Indian Ocean.</p>
