<p style="padding-left: 30px;">American Airlines and JetBlue Airways plan to terminate their interline traffic agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program accrual agreement, which includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Beginning today, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier. Effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and are not affected. The two airlines are working together to ensure these changes have little impact to customers.</p>
