House leaders put forward a plan that offers an election-year contrast to the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation’s health care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.</p>
<p>The tenets of the plan – which could expand to include the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations – are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.</p>
<p>But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with members outlining the plan, called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility and Peace of Mind.” with suggestions on how to talk about it with constituents.</p>
<p>Republicans have campaigned heavily on their opposition to the health care law. Those efforts accelerated last week after Republican David Jolly’s upset victory in a special House election in Florida in which the campaigns focused on the law.</p>
<p>Democrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture, saying the focus on long-held conservative ideas was more of an attempt to rally Republicans than to find bipartisan solutions.</p>
