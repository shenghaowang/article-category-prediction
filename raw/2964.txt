<p>Mt.Gox, the Japanese Bitcoin exchange that last month filed for bankruptcy protection amid outcry from customers, has updated its website to allow customers to log in and check their accounts.</p>
<p>It is the first time customers of one of the world’s biggest Bitcoin exchanges have been able to access their accounts for more than three weeks.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based Mt.Gox’s website went blank last month and days later the company filed for bankruptcy protection and admitted as many as 850,000 Bitcoin had been stolen by hackers, worth £313 million at current prices.</p>
<p>Mt.Gox and founder Mark Karpeles face legal action from angry customers around the world hoping to recover money. London-based law firm Selachii is putting together a class-action suit against the company, with over 100 customers signed up to the case.</p>
<p>As well as opening accounts, Mt.Gox posted a statement saying: “Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure.”</p>
