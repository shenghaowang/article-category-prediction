<p>WASHINGTON – More than 5 million people have now signed up for health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, thanks to a surge in enrollment over the past two weeks, the Obama administration announced Monday.</p>
<p>The quickening pace of enrollment confirms that many Americans are using the new marketplaces as a March 31 deadline approaches for getting coverage this year.</p>
<p>The latest figures indicate that roughly 1 million people enrolled in the past two weeks, surpassing the total for all of February.</p>
<p>If the pace continues, the Obama administration may come close to registering 6 million people in the first year that Americans are able to get guaranteed health coverage under the health-care law.</p>
<p>That would still fall short of the goal of 7 million that administration officials had hoped to reach before the botched rollout of the law last fall.</p>
<p>How many people have paid for the health insurance plans they have selected remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Administration officials have not released data on payments. Unofficial estimates from insurance companies and some state-run marketplaces suggest that as many as 20 percent of enrollees in some markets have yet to pay their premiums, although some of those may not yet have been billed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 6 million enrollments would be an important accomplishment for the law’s supporters, who feared that the marketplaces might collapse after the disastrous launch of the federal HealthCare.gov website in October.</p>
<p>Drawing on the experience of previous government health programs, the administration and many outside experts had long predicted a rush to sign up for coverage in the final few weeks.
