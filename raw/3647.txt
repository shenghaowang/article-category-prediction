<p>In another sign of continued pressures facing the fast-food industry, McDonald’s Corp. on Monday reported disappointing monthly same-store U.S. sales, its fourth-straight month of declines despite its aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games where it plugged products like its $5 20-piece chicken nuggets.</p>

</span>. More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s struggling to make itself relevant for today’s consumers.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/News-Research/research/2014Forecast-ExecSummary.pdf">National Restaurant Association’s</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year’s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.</p>
<p>“The U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald’s hasn’t kept up,” Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.</p>
<p>A case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-sbarro-bankruptcy-20140310,0,2948130.story">Sbarro on Monday  </a>filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings.aspx#.Ux3JCoUTadA">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.</p>
<p>To reverse waning demand, McDonald’s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson  also is “enhancing the breakfast experience” at the chain to create “more of a coffee culture.” After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory. It also will be offering a new Bacon Clubhouse sandwich featuring Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The company is also testing giving consumers the ability <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mcdonalds-may-soon-be-more-like-chipotle-2014-03-10">to customize their orders, </a>taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.</p>
<p>U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters. Overseas, European comparable sales were up 0.6%, while sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, as well as a stronger dollar, which made its food more expensive abroad.</p>
<p>Without the weight of a stronger dollar, total world-wide sales would have risen 2.2% , instead of a 0.6% decline in February, the company said.</p>
<p>Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald’s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.</p>
<p>“We believe the current more challenging reality is reflected in valuation,” said Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein, who rates the stock overweight. “While not the strongest near-term performer, we expect<br/>
MCD to regain lost U.S. share in ‘14, and benefit from a European macro recovery.”</p>
<p>McDonald’s shares dipped 0.4% to $95.11 Monday morning. They are down 3.6% during the past year, the third-worst Dow performer. In comparison, Chipotle jumped 82%, while Panera is up 11%, during the same period.</p>
