<p>BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Tuesday a ruling by the Constitutional Court upholding the legality of the euro zone’s bailout fund showed that the government’s policies to stabilize the euro were right. </p>
<p>“The Constitutional Court has confirmed our course for securing the stability of the currency,” Schaeuble said in a statement. </p>
<p>“That strengthens credibility and creates confidence,” he said, adding that comprehensive rights enjoyed by the German Bundestag lower house served as a guarantee that decisions on the stability of the euro were democratically legitimate. </p>
