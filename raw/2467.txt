<p>The city of Los Angeles is suing Time Warner Cable for allegedly <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-time-warner-cable-lawsuit-20140315,0,6140488.story#axzz2w2gPv8Ls" target="_blank">cheating</a> on its franchise fees to the city, according to a lawsuit filed Friday.</p>
<p>The city is seeking $9.7 million in payments after Time Warner Cable “blatantly refused to live up to its obligations to the city” said the suit, even as the company received $500 million a year from customers in the city for providing cable network services, the LA Times reports.</p>
<p>The suit claims that Time Warner Cable owed $2.5 million in franchise fees and public, education and governmental channel fees in 2008 and 2009, and $7.2 million in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>Time Warner Cable denied the allegations, calling them “without merit.”</p>
<p>The city charges cable companies franchise fees that amount to 5% of a cable operators’ revenues, instead of charging rent for the public right-of-way to install and maintain the company’s wires and cable boxes.</p>
