<p>Collapsed bitcoin exchange MtGox has provided a balance confirmation service on its website, allowing users to log in and confirm how much the exchange owes them.</p>
<p>The website also gives a legal announcement under the login option, <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" rel="nofollow">saying that </a>"this balance confirmation service is provided on this site only for the convenience of all users.</p>
<p>"Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users.</p>
<p>"Rehabilitation claims under a civil rehabilitation procedure become confirmed from a filing which is followed by an investigation procedure. The method for filing claims will be published on this site as soon as we will be in situation to announce it."</p>
<p>Japan's MtGox, which had hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to DDoS attacks. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Hoax?</strong></p>
<p>After the service launch by MtGox, a reddit account purportedly run by one of the exchange's former support agents said its server has been compromised and the login option on the website is a scam to steal passwords.</p>
<p>"DO NOT LOG IN PLEASE. ffs this is getting ridiculous, I have been notified that the server hosting MtGox has been compromised, if you have logged in they now have your account password, not sure what they could do with it at this point but the malicious intent is obvious. For the record, I do NOT work for MtGox anymore," <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/20ojkm/mtgox_enables_the_ability_to_login_and_check_your/cg5asi1" rel="nofollow">reddit user marionxd wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, other reddit users found the marionxd account to be fake and the MtGox server is not hacked. Some have logged into the their MtGox accounts and have been able to see correct balances.</p>
