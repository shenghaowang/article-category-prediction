<p>Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. (NYSE: DKS) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 results before markets opened Tuesday. For the fourth quarter, the sporting goods retailer reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.11 on revenues of $1.9 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $1.03 on revenue of $1.81 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $1.11 and $1.94 billion in revenue. The 2012 fourth quarter included 14 weeks, one more than in 2013.</p>
<p>For the full year, the company reported adjusted diluted EPS of $2.69 on revenues of $6.2 billion. The consensus estimates called for EPS of $2.70 on revenues of $6.21 billion.</p>
<p>Same-store sales for the fourth quarter rose 6.3%, with sales at Dick’s Sporting Goods stores up 6.8% and sales at Golf Galaxy stores down 9.4%. Online sales accounted for 12.2% of total sales for the quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which ended in February of 2013, same-store sales at the Dick’s Sporting Goods stores fell 2.2% in the quarter, rose 1.3% at Golf Galaxy stores and rose 54.2% for the company’s e-commerce business.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO said:</p>
<p>As we look to 2014, we believe our robust and growing omni-channel network and exciting merchandising opportunities will support double-digit growth in earnings.</p>
<p>The company estimates that full-year 2014 EPS will total $3.03 to $3.08. The outlook for the first quarter calls for EPS of $0.51 to $0.53 and same-store sales are expected to rise 3% to 4%, a sharp increase from a drop of 3.8% in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate calls for first quarter EPS of $0.54 and full-year EPS of $3.11.</p>
<p>The lower-than-expected forecast will weigh on shares. Quarterly results that missed the revenue estimate will add to the weight.</p>
<p>Shares were inactive in premarket trading, after having closed at $54.33 Monday night in a 52-week range of $45.44 to $58.87. Thomson Reuters had a consensus analyst price target of around $61.20 before earnings were announced.</p>
