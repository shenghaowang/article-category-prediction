<p>Alibaba Group Holding, China’s biggest e-commerce company, will begin the process of filing for an initial public offering in the US that may be the biggest since Facebook.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after Alibaba struggled to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve a proposed governance structure that would allow its partners to nominate a majority of its board of directors. A listing in China may be considered “should circumstances permit in the future,” the Hangzhou- based company said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p>Investment banks have valued Alibaba, founded by former English teacher Jack Ma, at as much as $200bn, which would make it the second-biggest Internet company behind Google Inc based on market capitalisation. A US share sale by Alibaba would be a blow to Hong Kong, which hasn’t hosted an IPO of more than $4bn since October 2010.</p>
<p>“Alibaba’s preference to keep its partnership structure is probably the biggest reason why it chose to list in the US,” Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial said yesterday. “The US has more investors and analysts in the technology space.”</p>
<p>Alibaba plans to work with Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company hasn’t signed official contracts with the banks for the IPO, the person said.</p>
<p>Representatives of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Spokesmen for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank weren’t immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Alibaba hasn’t decided when to file for the listing, how much it plans to raise, how large a stake it may sell or which exchange in the US it would seek to list on, according to the person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>“This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency,” Alibaba said in the statement. “We respect the viewpoints and policies of Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>The prospectus for an IPO may be disclosed as soon as April, people familiar with the matter have said. The company is also working with New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, two people familiar with the matter have said.</p>
<p>An Alibaba IPO could raise about HK$100bn ($12.9bn), Ernst &amp; Young LLP said June 28. That would make it the world’s biggest first-time share offering since Facebook raised $16bn in May 2013, and Hong Kong’s largest since AIA Group’s $20bn sale in October 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Alibaba’s expansion since Ma started the company in his Hangzhou apartment in 1999 with two dozen items for sale mirrors China’s emergence as an economic superpower. The company had about 25,000 employees at the end of February and generated about 70% of package deliveries in China in 2012. Customers bought 35bn yuan ($5.7bn) of goods on one sales promotion day via Alibaba’s two main platforms last year.</p>
<p>The success has made Ma, 49, one of China’s richest people, with an estimated net worth of $11.4bn, according to the Bloombergbnaires Index.</p>
<p>There is still room for growth. China has 618mn Internet users, greater than the population of any other country except India, and McKinsey &amp; Co estimates China’s Internet retail market will triple to $395bn from 2011 to 2015.</p>
<p>Alibaba, which operates online markets for products from Louis Vuitton bags to Boston lobsters, posted its fourth straight quarterly profit on surging sales. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $792mn in the three months ended September, a 12% increase from the June quarter, according to a January presentation from Yahoo! Inc, which owns a 24% stake. Revenue rose 51% to $1.78bn.</p>
<p>Analyst valuations of Alibaba rose 28% after the earnings, with the company worth $153bn, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News in February. That would make it bigger than 95% of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index.</p>
<p>Macquarie Group estimated Alibaba could be worth $200bn, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a January 29 report put the company’s value at about $150bn.</p>
<p>Google has a market capitalisation of $394bn; Amazon $172bn; and Facebook, owner of the world’s largest social network, $172bn, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Billionaire Ma Huateng’s Tencent Holdings, operator of the WeChat instant messaging service, is the biggest Hong Kong- traded Internet success story so far. Shares have soared more than 150 times from the June 2004 IPO price of HK$3.70, giving the company a market value of $142bn.</p>
<p>The IPO of Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook valued the company at $104bn, and the shares lost as much as half their value in the first few months of trading before starting to recover. On August 3, Facebook closed above its $38 offering price for the first time after mobile-ad sales surged. The stock closed at $67.72 on Friday.</p>
<p>Alibaba bought back a 20% stake from Yahoo! Inc in 2012 in a deal that valued the Chinese company at $35bn. The Sunnyvale, California-based web portal still owns 24% of Alibaba while Japan’s SoftBank Corp has about a 37% stake, the companies have said.</p>
<p>Alibaba’s $792mn profit in the September quarter, the most recently disclosed by Yahoo, compares with the $422mn Facebook earned in the same period and Tencent’s net income of 3.9bn yuan, or $634mn.</p>
<p>Alibaba asked Hong Kong’s exchange to allow a partnership of executives and shareholders to nominate the majority of board members, a person with knowledge of the matter said in August. That would enable Ma, who owns 7.4%, and his management team to maintain control.</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s bourse doesn’t allow share classes with different voting rights, as the US does. Such arrangements helped Zuckerberg and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin keep control of their companies after they went public.</p>
<p>Alibaba would “never” change its partnership structure, Reuters cited Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai as saying in an interview on March 12.</p>
<p>Under Alibaba’s proposal, all shareholders would still vote on the company’s nominees with partners being able to nominate an alternate board member if shareholders reject a candidate, the person familiar with Alibaba’s thinking said. No other investor rights would be changed, the person said. Deals involving company executives, major expenses and compensation would be voted on by all shareholders, according to the person.</p>
<p>“This is not a mere profit sharing mechanism, nor is it a vehicle of power to exert greater control over the company,” Ma said in a September 10 e-mail to employees explaining the partnership. The company has 28 partners, Ma said.</p>
<p>After starting as a business-to-business marketplace on Alibaba.com, where companies trade anything from shoelaces to steel, the company has morphed into a more consumer-focused operation. Its most popular platforms include Taobao Marketplace, which links individual buyers and sellers, and Tmall.com, which connects consumers to retail brands such as Microsoft Corp, Procter &amp; Gamble Co and Japanese clothing chain Uniqlo.</p>
<p>“Alibaba from day one has been based around making money, and it’s a real Chinese Internet success story,” said Mark Tanner, the founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. “Alibaba is huge now but will just continue to get a lot bigger.”</p>
<p>Affiliate Alipay, an online payment system like EBay’s PayPal, had more than 800mn registered accounts as of July. Alibaba is expanding into financial services as its finance arm offers funding to companies in China.</p>
