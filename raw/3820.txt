<p>Quiznos sandwich chain has filed for bankruptcy protection this week, according to a report by <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101495768" rel="nofollow">Reuters.</a></p>
<p>The chain, touted as the premiere toasted sub sandwich restaurant, reportedly submitted a request for prepackaged bankruptcy - a plan that softens the blow for companies involved in the liquidation process.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Quiznos officials said reorganizing the company would cut debts by at least $400 million.</p>
<p>Liabilities between $500 million and $1 billion have been listed in the company's bankruptcy bid, Reuters reported on Friday.</p>
<p>"Our business plan includes several key elements aimed at supporting our franchisees, including reducing food costs, implementing a franchise owner rebate program," Chief Executive of Quiznos Stuart Mathis wrote in a company statement.</p>
<p>Quiznos has reportedly gotten $15 million in debtor-in-possession financing from leading lenders to stay in business during the reorganization, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Competitors like Subway and Potbelly, another sub sandwich franchise, have reportedly cornered Quiznos in one of the toughest bouts of competition yet.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Subway - Quiznos' main competitor - is one of the largest fast food restaurants worldwide, with more than 41,000 franchises in nearly 100 different nations.</p>
<p>Potbelly's low prices and meal deals have also created issues for Quiznos, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>But the toasted sub company isn't the fast food chain that's encountered problems recently - pizza chain Sbarro filed for bankruptcy this week for the second time in the past three years. Â </p>
