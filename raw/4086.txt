<p>The Australian stockmarket looks set to open lower after Wall Street finished mixed as a better-than-expected United States jobs report helped offset anxiety over Ukraine that sent European equities lower.</p>
<p>At 645am (AEDT), the March share price index futures contract was down 16 points at 5,456.</p>
<p>The monthly US jobs report said the economy added 175,000 jobs in February, an improvement after jobs growth had plummeted the previous two months.</p>
<p>But Ukranian tensions continued with a threat from Russian gas company Gazprom to halt deliveries to Ukraine.</p>
<p>No major local economic or equities news is expected on Monday.</p>
<p>In Australia, the market on Friday ended the week with a slight gain as investors remained unfazed by Russia's incursion into Ukraine and drew comfort from local economic data.</p>
<p>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 16.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,462.3 points.</p>
<p>The broader All Ordinaries index added 17.3 points, or 0.32 per cent, at 5,477 points.</p>
