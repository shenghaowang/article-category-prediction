<p>The short form for the federal Affordable Care Act application. </p>
<p><em>Editor’s note: This is the second installment in a two-part series on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</em></p>
<p>As the deadline to buy insurance on the national health-care exchange fast approaches, resources are in place to help Missoula-area residents navigate the process.</p>
<p>But health care organizations are urging would-be buyers not to wait until the March 31 deadline.</p>
<p>Don’t wait to start looking at options on the online marketplace, said Olivia Riutta, outreach and enrollment project manager for the Montana Primary Care Association.</p>
<p>Going through the application process can be smooth and relatively quick, but making a final decision on an insurance plan that meets family health and budget needs also can take some time, Riutta said.</p>
<p>“That often takes more time than people anticipate,” she said.</p>
<p>Estimates are that upward of 170,000 Montanans remain uninsured, Riutta said. And recently released numbers show only about 22,500 of them have purchased insurance through the exchange.</p>
<p>Many of the remaining people are likely to have questions, although it’s unclear exactly how many will reach out for assistance, Riutta said.</p>
<p>“What we do know is we have our work cut out for us,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong>To help make sure as many people</strong> as possible have access to impartial help from certified application counselors and navigators, several events will be held later this month at the Missoula Public Library.</p>
<p>On March 22, 23, 29 and 30, experts will be on hand to provide support from 1 to 5 p.m. On the deadline, March 31, counselors again will be able to help with questions from 1 to 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Already, roughly 1,600 people have used certified application counselors at Partnership Health Center to navigate the health care exchange process, with another 1,500 or so people falling outside the subsidy parameters, said Jeff Seaton, the center’s chief operating officer.</p>
<p>According the Affordable Care Act, people have until March 31 to sign up on the exchange or face a financial penalty.</p>
<p>Because Montana didn’t expand Medicaid, some residents fall below the specifications for subsidies – for instance, an individual making less than $11,670 a year – and are instead eligible for an exemption from purchasing health insurance.</p>
<p>The relief is visible on some people’s faces when they hear they won’t be required to purchase insurance, as many are worried about the cost, said Candace Jackson, an application counselor at eligibility tech at Partnership.</p>
<p>“The No. 1 question is how much is it going to cost me and do I have to get insurance?” she said.</p>
<p>Because Partnership is a community health center, they’re able to offer a sliding fee scale to people who don’t qualify for subsidies, she added.</p>
<p>Other area health providers also have employees certified to help answer questions about ACA insurance requirements and the online exchange.</p>
<p>A steady stream of people have been asking for help at Community Medical Center, said Donald Miller, CMC’s director of revenue cycle.</p>
<p>“(Questions) are primarily geared around eligibility – how to get on the exchange, what the process is,” Miller said.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p><strong>Another point of confusion is the deadline itself, he said.</strong></p>
<p>Some people don’t understand that March 31 is the last day to sign up for insurance on the exchange until the next open enrollment period, unless they experience a life-changing event, such as the birth of a child, or they lose their employer-provided insurance, he said.</p>
<p>To help employers who are sending employees to the exchange for insurance, Community has partnered with PayneWest Insurance and the Missoula Job Service to send insurance agents to businesses to help answer questions and enroll workers. For more on the program, call 532-5902.</p>
<p>At Providence St. Patrick Hospital, people have been able to ask questions anytime, as well as during enrollment events each Monday from 2 to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>For the most part, people have questions about cost and if they’re eligible for any subsidies, said Merry Hutton, regional manager for ambulatory behavioral health and community benefit at the hospital.</p>
<p>People understand the deadline is coming, Hutton said.</p>
<p>“We’ve certainly seen a steady increase over the last month of people needing help for sure,” she said.</p>
<p>Although demand for help has leveled off some since issues with <a href="http://healthcare.gov">healthcare.gov</a> smoothed out, Seaton said Partnership is expecting an increase in people requesting help before the deadline.</p>
<p>“I would expect a big crush at that last week,” he said.</p>
<p>However, people should leave themselves time to do additional research and time to consider insurance plans, Jackson said.</p>
<p>“Don’t do it on the 31st,” she added.</p>
