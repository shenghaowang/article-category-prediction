DENVER</a> — As New Jersey <a href="http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2014/01/sen_scutari_wants_pot_legalized_in_nj.html">debates the merits of legalizing marijuana</a>, at least one state has reaped rewards from such legislation. </p>
<p>Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business.</p>
<p>The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.</p>
<p>Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.</p>
<p>The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.</p>
<p>Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.</p>
<p>New Jersey has a long way to go before its in Colorado's shoes.</p>
<p>The state signed a <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/nj_medical_marijuana_program_wont_consider_adding_new_illnesses_until_2015.html">medical marijuana law</a> four years ago, but <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/02/fix_njs_medical_marijuana_program_patient_advocates_dispensary_operators_say.html">patient advocates have complained </a>that the program is too expensive and few doctors are willing to participate.</p>
<p>State Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said last month he wants to take after Colorado and Washington state and legalize the sale and possession of marijuana in New Jersey.</p>
