<p>The mainland’s policies on Hong Kong remain steadfast, Premier Li Keqiang said as he vowed Beijing would “do everything” to help maintain the territory’s economic status.</p>
<p>He pledged the government’s support to the city – a sometimes recalcitrant ally – in maintaining its status as an international financial hub and shipping centre.</p>
<p>“[We will] do everything that benefits Hong Kong's prosperity. That’s what we did in the past, and [that holds true] now,” he said in Beijing on Wednesday, after the concluding ceremony of the National People’s Congress meetings.</p>
<p>“China’s policies to Hong Kong and Macau remain consistent and clear,” Li said.</p>
<p>The premier said Hong Kong played a key role in the country’s “opening up” economic policy, which began in the 1970s.</p>

<p>The premier also cited the city’s ability to weather the global economy’s ups and downs in recent years. “That means Hong Kong has a competitive economy,” Li said.</p>
<p>With the Hong Kong people’s fighting spirit, the city will maintain its edge amid increasing competition in the global market, he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, ceded by Britain to China in 1997, works under the “one party, two systems” policy which affords it autonomy in economic, legal and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>In recent months, Hong Kong and Beijing have grappled with the issue of implementing universal suffrage in the territory in three years. Hong Kong has also sought to douse anti-mainlander sentiments from small protest groups.</p>
<p>After months of tense speculation on whether Beijing would weigh in on the issue, the National People's Congress upheld the move towards suffrage as "according to law" and urged a "smooth implementation" of plans for direct elections.</p>
<p>However, Hong Kong lawmakers have been bogged down by bickering over the nomination process for the next chief executive -- whether to let the public or a special committee nominate the candidates.</p>
