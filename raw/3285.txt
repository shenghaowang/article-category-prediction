<p>From <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-10/yuan-drops-as-pboc-cuts-reference-rate-by-most-since-july-2012.html">Bloomie</a>:</p>
<p>The People’s Bank of China lowered the<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CNYMUSD:IND" title="Get Quote">daily reference rate</a> by 0.18 percent to 6.1312 per dollar today, the weakest level since Dec. 3…The cut in the yuan fixing “is significant, coming on the heels of poor trade data, and suggests a possible policy push to weaken the yuan to help exporters,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This would mean rising risks to more downside.”</p>
<p>Hmmm, who knows, maybe. I do think that the Chinese must be a little concerned about their real exchange rate. Its appreciation has been nothing short of spectacular since the GFC:</p>

<p>If that’s true then the PBOC has just embarked on a major loosening, not the warning to speculators about currency appreciation that I interpreted its moves as last week. Not beyond the realms of possibility given the pressure coming to bear in the economy!</p>
<p>Lol, whoa! Check out the new China data. First</p>

<p>Uh oh. Chinese new yuan loans for September were</p>
<p>Oh the joys of rebalancing!</p>
<p>Perhaps it might be better to stop using a word like ‘rebalancing’ that implies a carefully calibrated shifting of levers and policies to adjust the mix of an economy.</p>
<p>How about ‘jabbing the elephant with a sharp stick’</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>The Chinese government last week announced a change to economic policy and that it would start ‘jabbing the elephant with a sharp stick’.</p>
<p>Bystanders are advised to take care.</p>
<p>With the Japanese firing three arrows at their elephant, Yellen still handing out safari grade Bennies to the US elephant and the Europeans breaking bamboo poles over the dead euro elephant, the world economy is a dangerous place.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>That Chinese Elephant is going to look like a Porcupine before this is all over.</p>
<p>I find all of this concerning. The shadow banking system over there is a few Trillion compared to the U.S Sub prime problem at $1.2T. All the stats are heading in the wrong direction, money supply real estate topping out Producer prices, exports.<br>
 If BofA are right and the Solar Co. default was the bear sterns moment with GFC2 to come it will be worse then GFC1, so much has been invested to feed the Dragon, here and in the other emerging markets. It will hit Australia much harder just as our industrial base is crumbling the TOT will crumble. </br></p>
<p>Sometime ago I saw a chart which showed all the commodity booms over the last 200 odd years.<br/>
They all ended with a bang.</p>
<p>This looks like it could be the biggest Bang yet.</p>

<p>Your concerns are noted (actually more than that) but it is all good.</p>

<p>I can’t lay my hands on the exact piece, but I recall Albert Edwards warning that it’s time to take cover when the yuan starts to devalue to protect its home turf. (the best I can come up with!)<i>“We identify China as suffering from excessive currency strength relative to regional competitors, both in nominal, and most especially, in real terms,”</i><br/>

<p>If I understand the trades correctly (which I’m fairly certain I do) depreciation is bad for Chinese companies using LC/Commodity backed financing.  </p>
<p>Remember they have to pay back their LCs in USD; maybe some of them are hedging their FX risk but I doubt it.  Falling commodity prices, tightening credit conditions, falling yuan – every aspect of the financing deal is moving against the creditors.</p>
