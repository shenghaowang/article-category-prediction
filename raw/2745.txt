<p>The city of Los Angeles will not settle.  On Friday, the city sued the cable company, Time Warner Cable Inc., claiming the franchise owes them almost $10 million in past fees.  </p>
<p>"Time Warner owes L.A.'s taxpayers millions of dollars for the privilege of having its franchise," said Michael Feuer, the City Attorney in a City Hall news conference following the announcement of the law suit reported <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-time-warner-cable-lawsuit-20140315,0,6140488.story#axzz2vt5CFbUC">L.A. Times</a>. </p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Time Warner Cable collected more than $500 million a year from its customers, they neglected to pay their obligations to the city to operate the network.  The city claims Time Warner Cable Inc. did not pay f from 2008 through 2011 according to the <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20140314/los-angeles-launches-federal-lawsuit-against-time-warner-over-10-million-in-unpaid-franchise-fees">Daily News </a>.  </p>
<p>However in s statement the cable network company denied the charges that they had not paid the city.  </p>
<p>This new comes after the announcement made by Time Warner Inc. that it will be increasing customer rates by about 6% a month for everyone not covered in the promotional package.  Time Warner Inc. currently has about 1.5 million customers and the hike in prices will affect about 30% of these people. </p>
