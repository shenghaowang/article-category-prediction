<p>What a difference five years makes.</p>
<p>Five years ago Sunday, the stock market
indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average hitting 6,547.10 on March 9, 2009 -- less than
half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&amp;P 500, meanwhile, dipped
to 676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007,
when it had soared to 1,565.15.</p>
<p>* <a href="http://media.cleveland.com/business_impact/other/F06MN.PDF">Download the above chart in full-size</a></p>
<p>Today, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every
week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&amp;P is at more than
1,875.</p>
<p>Many of our local companies have enjoyed a
similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have
soared and dividends have increased in many cases.</p>
<p>The chart below looks at the total five-year
return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside
the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and
workers. The total return includes appreciation in the share price and
income including dividends. </p>
<p>So if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in
March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the
total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with
Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth
$28,380. </p>
<p>If you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar
Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In
many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M.
Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about
$3,000 today.</p>
<p>In some cases, the fabulous returns are a
reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008
and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has
done since then.</p>
<p>Likewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few
cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years. </p>
<p>In other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence,
the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19
percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more
modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded. </p>
<p>In the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the
electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in
2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.</p>
<p>The five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the
share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.</p>
