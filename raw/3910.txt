<p>"Investors are cautious.... as global economic and geopolitical concerns cast a shadow on Wall Street," a market note from Wells Fargo Advisors said.</p>
<p>"Specifically, uncertainty over upcoming Chinese economic data and tensions between Russia and the Ukraine are weighing on stocks."</p>
<p>"The two headlines stories driving the market are China and perhaps still some thought about what is going on in Ukraine," David Levy of Kenjol Capital Management said, echoing the concern about whether China is still slowing down.</p>
