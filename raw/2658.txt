<p>Sometimes when one company raises prices, we consumers benefit. Today's case example is Amazon's $20 increase for Amazon Prime membership (which you can <a href="http://www.itworld.com/consumerization-it/409655/how-extend-your-amazon-prime-membership-another-year-79" target="_blank">still get around</a> if you really want to). Shoprunner, noticing Prime members' distress at this price hike, is offering us unlimited 2-day shipping for free for a year.</p>
<p>The free 2-day shipping works at major online retailers such as Newegg, Radio Shack, Toys R Us, Timberland, and Tiger Direct--and even the delivery fee from Dominos. Like Prime for Amazon, there's no minimum order size. Even better, return shipping is free (unlike with Amazon Prime).</p>
<p>To get the free year, however, you'll have to provide proof of your current Prime membership (not yet renewed), and that involves jumping through a few hoops. In your Amazon account, take a screenshot of the printable receipt for your Prime membership andthen email it to DoneWithPrime@ShopRunner.com.</p>
<p>Even if you decide to stick with Prime, you can still get the free year of ShopRunner, which is normally worth $79. (After your free one year trial, your membership will expire and your credit card <em>won't</em> be charged unless you authorize it.)</p>
