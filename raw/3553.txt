<p>Bloomberg reported that copper futures in New York capped the biggest loss in more than two years as China’s first onshore default stoked concern that rising debt will curb demand in the Asian nation, the world’s largest consumer.<br/><br/>Mr Qiu Xinhong, a bond fund manager in Guangzhou at Golden Eagle Asset Management Company said that “After Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science &amp; Technology Company failed to pay full interest on its bonds, more defaults may follow, including by makers of nonferrous metals. Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange have climbed for eight straight weeks, the longest streak in two years adding to signs of slowing use.”<br/><br/>Prices have lost 9.2% this year, the most among 34 commodities tracked by Bloomberg, as signs of faltering growth in China boosted the outlook for a surplus. Global production will outpace demand by 81,000 tonnes in 2014, after a deficit of 175,000 tonnes last year.<br/><br/>Mr Tom Power senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago said that “You have a lot of fear in the market right now. The potential for more default is really what’s pushing the market. The market seems to be poised for another move lower.”<br/><br/>Source – Bloomberg<br/><br/>&lt;a href="http://www.metalguru.in /"&gt;(www.metalguru.in)&lt;/a&gt;</p>
