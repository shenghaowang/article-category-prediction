<p>Sbarro says it's filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, marking the struggling pizza chain's second trip through bankruptcy court in less than three years.<br/></p>

<p>The filing comes shortly after it closed 155 of its locations. It still has more than 800 locations worldwide.<br/></p>
<p>Sbarro had also filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011 and emerged a few months later, saying that it significantly cut its debt and received a capital infusion. A new CEO then led a push to revitalize the chain's image by touting new recipes and ovens.<br/></p>
<p>But the efforts apparently didn't take hold.</p>
<p>Sbarro, based in Melville, N.Y., says its strategy of store closings and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability and reduce outstanding debt by more than 80 percent.</p>
