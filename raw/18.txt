<p>Navy SEALs seized control of a rogue oil tanker early Monday near the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, stopping an attempt by a Libyan militia to sell the shipload of crude in defiance of the Libyan government.</p>
<p>While defense officials are staying mum on specifics, there's a good chance a team of SEALs from Virginia Beach carried out the mission. Citing a special operations blog, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the commandos were members of Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DEVGRU.</p>
<p>As a rule, Navy public affairs officers don't comment on the specifics of SEAL missions, especially those involving the Dam Neck Annex-based unit that's more widely known as SEAL Team 6. But this raid had all the marking of a DEVGRU job: an international operation in a volatile part of the world, personally approved by the president, conducted in the dark of night and only publicized hours afterward. No shots fired, no one injured, three armed hijackers captured.</p>
<p>The predawn mission, carried out by about two dozen SEALs using high-speed boats from a nearby destroyer, rescued the fragile transitional government in Tripoli from a potentially catastrophic loss of control over its main source of revenue and last source of power: Libya's vast oil reserves.</p>
<p>The tanker had threatened to uncork those reserves by enabling a militia that has blockaded Libya's major oil ports for the last eight months to begin selling the oil on its own, independent of the state. Flying under a North Korean flag as cover but reportedly owned by an Arab shipping company, the tanker, called the Morning Glory, left the Libyan port of Sidra unmolested last week with a hull full of illicit oil.</p>
<p>The State Department warned last week that it considered the shipment a "theft from the Libyan people" and noted that, along with the Libyan government, several American companies also have stakes in the oil.</p>
<p>Since then, the Pentagon said in a statement on Monday, the governments of Libya and Cyprus had requested American assistance in apprehending the tanker. President Obama authorized the operations just after 10 p.m. Sunday in Washington, the statement said.</p>
<p>Within 10 minutes – before dawn Monday over the Mediterranean – the SEALs launched their boats from the guided missile destroyer Roosevelt, which also provided backup support from a shipboard helicopter.</p>
<p>Quickly fanning out across the Morning Glory, the SEALs captured and disarmed the three Libyans described by the tanker's crew as hijackers, American officials said. The mission was complete within two hours of boarding, they added.</p>
<p>Later, sailors from the Norfolk-based guided missile destroyer Stout boarded the Morning Glory and are sailing the ship back to Libya. It's expected to return late this week.</p>
<p>Three Libyans will remain in U.S. custody until the tanker returns to Libya. Officials said the crew included 21 people of various nationalities.</p>
<p>The attempted oil sale fueled a political crisis in Libya. The parliament, where Islamist lawmakers had a long rivalry with then-Prime Minister Ali Zidan, used the crisis to vote him out, saying it had underlined his weakness.</p>
<p>Libya's interim government thanked the United States and Cyprus and "all those who contributed" to the vessel's capture, adding, "Oil is the backbone of the national economy and tampering with it ... is unacceptable."</p>
<p>Still, even as the tanker sailed back, there were reminders that the situation was not Libya's only source of political instability. A series of car bombings on Monday at a military academy graduation ceremony in Benghazi killed at least eight people, most believed to be graduating cadets, and wounded more than a dozen, hospital and security officials said.</p>
