<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The firm behind the hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga is hoping to value its company at more than $7.5billion when it floats on the US stock market.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Analysts previously estimated King.com could be valued at more than $5billion when it announced it was planning a debut on the US stock market.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The announcement also prompted predictions it could lead to a flurry of technology company listings this year.<br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The game, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same colour, was the most downloaded free app of 2013, and the year's top revenue-grossing app.</font></p>

<p class="imageCaption">King.com, the firm behind the mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, is hoping to value the company at $7.5billion when it floats on the U.S. stock market</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="imageCaption">The game, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app of 2013, and the year's top revenue-grossing app</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The company told the Security and 
Exchange Commission yesterday that it expected to price its shares at 
between $21 and $24, according to the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/king-ipo-value-candy-crush-saga-company-7-5-billion-1439989?google_editors_picks=true" rel="nofollow" style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank">International Business Times</a>.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players need to pay for add-ons or extra lives.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The successful flotation of Twitter in November and a surge in Facebook shares have fuelled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including Spotify, AirBnB and Square, as well as King.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">But some analysts have questioned whether King can keep up its breakneck pace of growth, particularly given the difficulty some other games makers have experienced in maintaining success.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Zynga, the maker of Farmville, has seen its share price halve since its late 2011 initial public offering (IPO), while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of its 2010 hit Angry Birds.</font>  </p>
<p class="imageCaption">The company told the Security and Exchange Commission yesterday that it expected to price its shares at between $21 and $24</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'It's (Candy Crush Saga) a hot game and King is a fast-growing company, but obviously you have precedents for these type of companies that have been affected by the boom and bust cycles of the game market,' said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The IPO prospectus offered a first 
glimpse into King's money-making machine, which generated $1.9billion 
in revenues in 2013, or $5million a day. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">It
 posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortization (EBITDA) of $825million in the year, up from $28.5million
 in 2012.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The firm has more than 180 titles in 14 languages.</font><br/></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The most popular include Candy Crush Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga, Pet Rescue Saga and Bubble Witch Saga.</font><br/></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">The biggest hit by far is Candy Crush Saga, which has been downloaded more than 500million times since its launch in 2012.</font><br/></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Overall the firm has over 324million average monthly unique users, as of December 31, 2013, across web, social and mobile platforms.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"> </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">By comparison, Zynga and Supercell, the company behind Clash of Clans, both earned around $900million in revenues last year.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Adam Krejcik, an analyst at Eilers Research in California, said the results in King's U.S. filing were 'staggering', but noted a slowdown in quarterly revenues at the end of 2013.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'Have we seen peak revenue and bookings for King, or can they make up for declines with other games?' he questioned.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">King co-founder and CEO Riccardo 
Zacconi said the group, which is 48.2 per cent-owned by private equity 
firm Apax Partners, had so far launched five games for mobile phones and
 all had attracted substantial fan-bases.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'Mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent,' he said in the prospectus.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'Consumption habits have changed - mobile has meant that people consume more digital content than they ever have before, and they want to be entertained over short periods of time whenever and wherever they are.'</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Japanese tech and telecoms group Softbank bought 51 percent of Supercell late last year, valuing the firm at $3billion, or around 6.5 times its 2013 EBITDA.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Applying the same multiple to King's 2013 EBITDA would value the firm at around $5.3billion.</font></p>
<p class="imageCaption">Some analysts have questioned whether King can keep up its breakneck pace of growth, particularly given the difficulty some other games makers have experienced in maintaining success</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'The risk here is that the company is valued beyond the $7-$10billion range because it is a hot company,' Mr Schuster said. <br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'On the first or the second day of trading the company is going to be an expensive buy and if the stock does well in the first month or so there is no room for upside.'</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">King, which plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'KING', intends to raise up to $500million in the listing, but the amount a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees and the final size of the IPO could be different.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Founded in Sweden in 2003, King was profitable in 2005 and has not had a funding round since September of that year, when it raised €34million ($46million) from Apax and Index Ventures.</font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;"><br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">In the last few months, it has made more than $500million in dividend payments - including a $217million payout this month - to its board of directors, its top executives and major investors. Index Ventures owns 8.3 per cent of King.</font><br/></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">A flooring salesman who left school at
 16 is set to become one of Britain’s richest men as he stands to pocket
 £520million when the firm behind the hit game Candy Crush floats on the
 stock market.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Mel Morris, a
 former Derby County FC director, has a 12 per cent stake in King 
Digital Entertainment - maker of the addictive game involving moving 
candies to make a line of three in the same colour.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The
 father-of-two was also behind dating website uDate, launched in 1998, 
which was sold for £100million in 2003 and netted him £20million, some 
of which was later invested into King.</font></p>

<p class="imageCaption">In the money: Mel Morris (left, in his LinkedIn

<p class="imageCaption">Entrepreneur: Mr Morris was also behind dating website uDate, launched in 1998, which was sold for £100million in 2003 and netted him £20million, some of which was later invested into King</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr Morris, 58, 
who was born in Littleover, Derbyshire, set up a hardwood flooring firm 
and property company in Spain upon leaving school - and was a management
 consultant by the age of 20.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Later
 on came uDate, whose success was put down to matching innovative 
technology with a large customer base. Three years after that sale, he 
was part of a consortium that took over Derby County.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr
 Morris, who is married, then sold his internet security company Prevx 
in 2010 - which produced anti-virus software for businesses and 
individuals - for more than £10million to US giant Webroot.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">It
 was only revealed last month that Mr Morris was a significant player in
 King, after the firm’s filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission named him as chairman of the business.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">He is expected to shoot into The Sunday 
Times Rich List - with his £520million from Candy Crush set to put him 
in between the likes of Harry Potter author JK Rowling and entrepreneur 
Peter Jones.</font></p>
<p class="imageCaption">Chief executive: Italian entrepreneur Riccardo Zacconi (pictured), 47, who has led King with Toby Rowland since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 per cent stake after the IPO</p>
<p>  <font style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr Morris lived from 1996 to 2004 in a
 three-bedroom home in an area of Belper, Derbyshire, with an average 
house value of £470,000, although his residence since then is not known.<br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">King
 - which gets 78 per cent of its revenue from Candy Crush, the most 
downloaded free app last year - expects to be worth £4.5billion when 
going public on the Nasdaq in the US this month.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Candy
 Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The London-based firm’s game 
was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app 
for Android devices a month later.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The
 game - which was the top revenue-grossing app in 2013 - has been 
downloaded more than 500million times. The basic games are free, but 
players must pay for add-ons or extra ‘lives’.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Italian
 entrepreneur Riccardo Zacconi, 47, who has led King with Toby Rowland 
since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 per 
cent stake after the IPO.</font><br/></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr Zacconi, who lives in London with his Chinese-Swedish wife and son, is in line for a £300million payday. He co-founded the firm with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">The chief
 executive of King - which was originally launched with the idea of 
specialising in games that could be played on Yahoo! - also worked with 
uDate until it was sold in 2003.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Mr
 Zacconi lived in a three-bedroom flat worth £2.2million in South 
Kensington, central London, from 2007 to 2010, before moving to a 
three-bedroom house worth £1.4million in Bayswater, west London.<br/></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">King
 wants to benefit from focusing on the £10billion market for mobile game
 apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga, which has struggled to
 make its games as popular on phones as online.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">King
 said yesterday that it expects to price its initial public offering 
(IPO) at $21-$24 (£13-14) per share, valuing it slightly higher than 
Hasbro, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.</font></p>
<p class="imageCaption">Makers: Thomas Hartwig (left) and Sebastian

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Twitter’s
 successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook’s shares have 
fuelled speculation of other tech firms going public, including 
music-streaming service Spotify and lodging website AirBnB.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Stellar
 popularity has now helped King's revenue grow to £361million in the 
fourth quarter of 2013 from £13million in the first quarter of 2012.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">But
 most of that growth was fulled by Candy Crush rather than any of the 
180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own 
website.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">King, which has 
more than 650 employees, has focused on launching more games on mobile 
platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to £10billion this 
year from just £4billion in 2010.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Zynga's stock price has 
halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of the Farmville game 
waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of 
Angry Birds.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">King's IPO is 
scheduled to be priced on March 25, and the stock will start trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘KING’ on March 26.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Of
 the 22.2million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 
15.5million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 
6.7million shares, King said.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:1.2em;">Unlike
 most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is 
profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations
 for each of the last nine years.</font></p>
