<p>The maker of the hugely popular puzzle game Candy Crush is hoping to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303730804579434732351511254?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection&amp;mg=reno64-wsj" target="_blank">raise</a> up to $532.8 million in its initial public offering as it values its operations at nearly $7.6 billion, reflecting the rapid ascendence of the online mobile gaming industry.</p>
<p>The developer of the irresistibly addictive game, King Digital Entertainment, wants to sell 22.2 million shares between $21 and $24 in its IPO, placing it ahead of its rival and last game giant to go public, Zynga. Candy Crush’s maker King initially filed for the IPO last month.</p>
<p>The company saw an average of 144 million daily active users playing its games more than 1.4 billion times a day—an increase from 128 million daily active users playing more than 1.2 billion times in December.</p>
<p>King’s target valuation for its IPO would set it behind more established gaming players like Electronic Arts ($9.2 billion valuation) and Activision Blizzard ($14.3 billion).</p>
