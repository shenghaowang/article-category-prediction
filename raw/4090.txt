<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Behind the silos you can&amp;apost miss along I-65 are new training grounds for LMPD&amp;aposs SWAT team.<br/><br/>With their gear on and guns drawn, officers acted out the dangerous scenarios they respond to throughout the landmark property Monday. <br/><br/>SWAT team leaders say it&amp;aposs important to train in new locations so officers are facing different challenges. The silos property is especially helpful because it has warehouses, offices and the silos.</p>
<p>"The problem is if you train in the same place on a regular basis, then guys just get kind of used to the room to where they&amp;aposre not really reacting as much," said Lt. Ryan Bates. <br/><br/>The silos property used be owned by Solae Co. to process soy beans. U of L recently bought it and is allowing the SWAT team to practice there. </p>
<p>"We&amp;aposre going to tear down this property so if they want to bang in doors, knock out windows, whatever they need to do, that&amp;aposs fine with us," said University of Louisville spokesman Mark Hebert. <br/></p>
<p>About 30 members started the training just before 10 a.m. Monday. Lt. Bates says they practiced situations like active shooters or locating someone inside a building. <br/></p>
<p>"They were excited to come to a different location," Lt. Bates said. "We have several sites that we go to on a regular basis. Anytime we can go somewhere new and get a different look is appreciated."<br/><br/>Lt. Bates says the SWAT team often practices at the same schools and businesses. SWAT team members say when they respond, it&amp;aposs important to be ready for anything. </p>
<p>"We need to be flexible so if we learn and train to be flexible everywhere we go, we&amp;aposll be able to do what we need to," said Sgt. Jason Poston. </p>
<p>University officials say right now they&amp;aposre working to find out how much it&amp;aposll cost to tear the silos and buildings down and don&amp;apost know what will be built on the land. <br/></p>
