<p> The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Wednesday, with sentiment suggesting an extension of the downtrend, as the <span class="landLinks"><a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/Markets.aspx">markets</a></span> grapple with uncertainties. The lack of any directional cues has intensified the uncertainty concerning the domestic economic outlook, while concerns about the global <span class="landLinks"><a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/EconomicNews.aspx">economy</a></span> have also increased in the wake of recent data from China. Global cues are negative, with European stocks declining sharply in the session. Against the backdrop, the markets may witness more selling, although a large scale correction is unlikely.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks declined moderately on Tuesday amid a lack of any major directional cues. The major averages opened higher but moved lower immediately after. After staging a short-lived recovery in late morning trading, the indexes declined steadily throughout the remainder of the session before closing lower.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials ended down 67.43 points or 0.41 percent at 16,351 and the S&amp;P 500 Index closed 9.54 points or 0.51 percent lower at 1,868 and the Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 4,307, down 27.26 points or 0.63 percent.</p>
<p>Twenty-one of the thirty Dow components declined, with DuPont (DD), JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), United Technologies (UTX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) leading the declines.</p>
<p>Biotechnology, energy, basic material, computer hardware and financial stocks were among the worst performers of the session.</p>

<p>The major Asian markets retreated, with the negative lead from Wall Street weighing on the averages in the region. The risk aversion in play in the markets exerted upward pressure on the yen, sending Japanese stocks lower.</p>
