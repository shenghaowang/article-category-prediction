<p><strong>PORTLAND, Ore. —</strong> Herbalife Ltd. says that it is facing an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Herbalife, which plans to open a $130 million manufacturing plant this year in Winston-Salem, said that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The FTC’s website says that these are used to investigate possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to elaborate.</p>
<p>The company, which has faced accusations of operating a pyramid scheme, said that it welcomes the inquiry given “tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace” about its business.</p>
<p>Herbalife says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully.</p>
<p>The company, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and based in Los Angeles, uses a network of distributors to sell its nutritional supplements and weight-loss products globally.</p>
<p>The FTC inquiry comes just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company.</p>
<p>Ackman has bet against the company and said repeatedly that he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme, which is when a company makes most of its money by recruiting new salespeople rather than on the products that they sell.</p>
<p>The head of Pershing Square Capital Management resumed this effort Tuesday, holding a public event to detail his firm’s claims of how its Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme in China, violating laws there. Pershing declined to comment Wednesday on the FTC investigation.</p>
<p>Ackman launched his public attack on Dec. 19, 2012 – the same day Herbalife announced it was buying the former Dell Inc. plant in Winston-Salem.</p>
<p>Herbalife says it is on pace for opening its $130 million manufacturing plant this year. Spokesman Julian Cacchioli said the company had hired 60 employees by the end of 2013. It expects to complete the hiring of 493 full-time employees by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>Since Ackman’s accusations surfaced, local government and economic officials have said they are paying attention to, but staying at arm’s length from, the accusations. The company is getting local and state assistance with the project.</p>
<p>Ackman has had as much as $1.5 billion at stake in his short portion on Herbalife. In December, a Belgian court of appeals overturned an earlier decision that found the company was operating a pyramid scheme.</p>
