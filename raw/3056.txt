<p class="p1">The Sbarro pizza restaurant chain filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, just three weeks after it closed down 40 percent of its locations, mostly in airports, malls and highway rest stops.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy is pre-packaged, which means it has already been received and approved by creditors, <a href="/topics/cnn/">CNN</a><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/03/10/news/companies/sbarro-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">reported</a>. <a href="/topics/cnn/">The company</a> will reorganize and, in the process, trim about $140 million of its debt.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing is the company’s second in three years. In April 2011, <a href="/topics/cnn/">company executives</a> shuttered 155 stores in the United States, and filed for bankruptcy protection for the other 600 stores owned and operated by franchisees, in 40 different countries.</p>
