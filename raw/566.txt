<p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) � An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.</p>
<p>The man who cobbled the deal together said yesterday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.</p>
<p>"No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit," said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents who he calls a "well-known billionaire."</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.</p>
<p>"It was worse than any audit you can think of," he said.</p>
<p>Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing United Kingdom life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen's policy.</p>
<p>Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based S.G. LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation sent by the firm in 2010.</p>
<p>Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.</p>
<p>"He wants his next of kin to keep working hard," Frances said.</p>
<p>Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death.</p>
<p>Frances also said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.</p>
