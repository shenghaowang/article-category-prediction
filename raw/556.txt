</p>
<p>The calmly spoken words – "All right, good night" – were broadcast from the jet after someone on board first disabled one of its communication systems – the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) – about 40 minutes after takeoff.</p>
<p>Investigators believe it was co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid who spoke the words.</p>
<p>The ACARS equipment sends information about the jet's engines and other data to the airline and the revelation that there was no mention of trouble on board has added to suspicions that one or both of the pilots were somehow involved in the disappearance of the flight.</p>
<p>With the transponder going down about 14 minutes later, investigators are now convinced that the plane's disappearance was deliberate.</p>
<p>Whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, according to Malaysian officials and aviation experts.</p>

<p class="quote">
            “We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence”
        </p>
<p>The new theory comes as police searched the homes of both pilots over the weekend.</p>
<p>They confiscated an elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues.</p>
<p>Shah, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories.</p>
<p>The head of Malaysia Airlines said the simulator was not in itself cause for any suspicion.</p>
<p>The dad-of-three was also said to be a 'fanatical' supporter of Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was jailed for homosexuality just hours before the plane vanished.</p>
<p>His wife and three children moved out of their home the day before.</p>

<p>Malaysian police are also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.</p>
<p>Sources have also claimed that the jet could have been deliberately flown to a Taliban base on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The search for the plane, which went missing over a week ago with 239 people on board, has now widened as the Malaysian government believe the plane was deliberately diverted and may have flown as far north as Central Asia or south into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Australia has now taken the lead in searching for the missing Boeing 777 over the southern Indian Ocean as they through a huge area of Asia, stretching into Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the "ill-fated aircraft".</p>
<p>He said: "Australia will do its duty in this matter.</p>
<p>"We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery."</p>
<p>Twenty-six countries are involved in the search for the plane, whose disappearance is one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history.</p>
