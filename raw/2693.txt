<p>(Reuters) - Hertz Global Holdings Inc (<span id="”symbol_HTZ.N_0”"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=HTZ.N">HTZ.N</a></span>) said it would spin off its equipment rental business, raising $2.5 billion to reduce debt and fund a $1 billion share buyback. </p>
<p>Hertz, the No. 2 U.S. car rental company behind privately owned Enterprise Rent-A-Car, has been under pressure from investors to shed the business and focus on car rentals. </p>
<p>The equipment business, which rents out equipment ranging from small tools to earth movers, generated revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2013, about 14 percent of Hertz’s total revenue. </p>
<p>The company said the spinoff would involve a one-time payment of $2.5 billion from the rental business along with a tax-free distribution to shareholders. </p>
<p>Hertz’s shares, which have risen 28 percent in the past year, were down 0.26 percent at $27.15 in late-afternoon trading on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Hertz’s remaining businesses would include the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly car rental brands and the Donlen fleet leasing and management business. </p>
<p>The company put in place a poison pill in December to ward off any takeover attempts at a time when activist investors such as Daniel Loeb’s Third Point Capital were buying up shares. </p>
<p>Hertz operates in a consolidated market, along with Avis Budget Group Inc (<span id="”symbol_CAR.O_1”"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=CAR.O">CAR.O</a></span>) and Enterprise, which together control about 90 percent of the U.S. car rental market. </p>
<p>Hertz, which gets about 50 percent of its revenue from airport rentals, is expected to get a boost in 2014 as spending on business and leisure travel picks up in a recovering U.S. economy. </p>
<p>The new company, Hertz Equipment Rental Corp (HERC), is expected to benefit from a recovery in non-residential construction. Its biggest competitor is market leader United Rentals Inc (<span id="”symbol_URI.N_2”"><a href="/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=URI.N">URI.N</a></span>). </p>
<p>“One of the challenges or opportunities for the HERC management team post the spinoff would be to improve operational deliveries - both pricing and time utilization,” Jefferies analyst Justin Jordan said. Time utilization is a measure of the time equipment is rented out during a year. </p>
<p>Hertz said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter adjusted net profit fell 13 percent to $121.1 million due to lower-than-expected rental prices and higher expenses. Revenue rose 10.2 percent to $2.56 billion. </p>
<p>BofA Merrill Lynch and Barclays were financial advisers to Hertz for the spinoff. Jenner &amp; Block LLP and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP provided legal counsel, while KPMG was tax adviser. </p>
<p>The spinoff will close by early 2015, Hertz said. </p>
