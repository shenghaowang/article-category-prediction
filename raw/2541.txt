<p>Welcome to the Asia Markets live blog, a running account of what the region’s stock markets are doing, along with other news. Today, there is no shortage of headlines for investors to chew over, including China widening the yuan\’s trading band, Crimea reportedly voting to join Russia, and U.S. IPOs for Alibaba and Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>Sydney is trading on the weak side as the Monday session opens, but not <em>so</em> weak — not Friday’s-1.5%-drop weak.</p>
<p>With investors wondering what Crimea’s irredentist referendum means (sanctions? war?) and dealing with volatility in commodities, the banks are lower: CBA is down 0.4%, NAB is down 0.2%, Westpac is down 0.3%, and ANZ is down 0.1%.</p>
<p>BlueScope is also getting slapped lower (currently down 0.7%) amid a soft market for steel. Shanghai steel futures suffered their biggest weekly drop in almost a year, per Reuters.</p>
<p>Among the gainers, the top two senior miners — BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto — are up 0.3% each as investors balance a roughly 1% loss for iron ore against a roughly 1% gain for LME copper futures. Helping BHP are reports the company may launch a massive share buyback to return some its cash pile to investors.</p>
<p>But those miners focused on iron ore aren’t able to brush off the commodity’s weakness so easily, with Fortescue down 0.7% and Atlas Iron flat.</p>
<p>And then the gold miners: With the yellow metal rising on the back of the Ukranian crisis, Newcrest and Kingsgate are up 3.3% each, while Evolution Mining is 3.6% higher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leighton Holdings is lower by 3.8% in early moves, as the shares trade without rights to the latest dividend. As you may remember, Leighton just lost its CEO after majority shareholder Hochtief AG <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/leighton-ceo-stands-down-as-hochtief-sweetens-bid-2014-03-12-194855036">sweetened its bid</a> for a larger stake in the Australian contractor.</p>
<p>After briefly tickling positive territory, the Nikkei Average is trading flat, recovering from its opening drop of 0.5%.</p>
<p>Helping hold the Japanese blue-chip benchmark above water is Softbank: The telecom holds a heavy weighting on the Nikkei Average, and it’s currently up a rocking 6%. The gain comes as shareholders stand to make a tidy sum of money if Alibaba (of which Softbank owns 37%) goes ahead with a U.S. IPO, as reports are saying.</p>
<p>Without the Softbank gains, the Nikkei might be closer to where the broader Topix is trading — currently down 0.5%. Part of this is the yen’s continued strength and a negative lead from Wall Street, as rising tensions in Ukraine dampen global risk appetite. Right now, the dollar is changing hands at 101.38 yen, holding on to losses seen late last week.</p>
<p>Thus, we see Sony down 1.4%, Fujitsu and Fanuc down 1.5% each, and NEC off 3.2%.</p>
<p>Auto makers are a bit closer to the flatline though, with Toyota Motor unchanged (after brief gains this morning), Nissan down 0.2%, Mazda up 0.2%, and Honda off 0.1% despite <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/honda-recalls-odyssey-vans-due-to-fire-risk-nhtsa-2014-03-15">a recall of some of its Honda Odyssey vehicles</a> in the U.S.</p>
<p>Not doing so well, however, is Aeon — lower by 4.4% after chopping about 20% from its net-profit estimate for the fiscal year that ended last month.</p>
<p>And Nikon is down 2.6% as China’s state television made the camera company the focus of its latest consumer expose. CCTV said Nikon is selling faulty cameras, among other issues, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) down 0.1%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) down 0.1%<br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.1%</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/15/china-doubles-size-of-yuan-trading-band-in-effort-to-kill-one-way-bets/">official explanation</a> of China’s move over the weekend to widen the yuan’s daily trading band to 2% is that it will introduce greater two-way volatility.</p>
<p>But, writes Craig Stephen in this week’s column, another possibility is that we should simply expect it as a policy to send the yuan lower.</p>
<p>China’s credit system needs liquidity, and some analysts say Beijing will need to print money to keep the economy afloat rather than try to keep its currency on its upward trend. Otherwise, China could face hundreds or even thousands of credit defaults.</p>

<p>Hong Kong investors’ mood seems to have been damped by rising tensions in Ukraine, although losses are capped today by a rebound in Shanghai marekts. </p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index is currently trading 0.1% lower at 21,522.41, while the Shanghai Composite is up 0.5% to 2,013.80.</p>
<p>Internet giant Tencent Holdings is sliding further by 4.2% in Hong Kong trading, as investors remain cautious of buying Tencent after its top rival Alibaba Group announced its plan to go for an IPO in the U.S. over the weekend.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, markets are also awaiting  Tencent’s annual results due out Wendesday, while also digesting news that the central bank has halted online credit-card services offered by it and Alibaba, among others.</p>
<p>The central bank’s recent decision on online credit cards is also affecting shares of China Citic Bank Corp, which is down 8% in Shanghai and 1.3% lower in Hong Kong. The bank has said previously it planned to work with Tencent and Alibaba to launch virtual credit cards for online shoppers. However, on Sunday night, the bank said the online credit-card service was still in test mode, and the bank would evaluate its compliance with the central bank’s ruling and security issues before any official launch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong tycoon Josepho Lau was found guilty of bribery and money laundering by a Macau court and was sentenced to five years in jail, helping inspire a 2% fall in the shares of his flagship firm, Chinese Estates Holdings. Lau stepped down as Chinese Estates chairman on Friday, succeeded by his son, Ming-wai, according to a filing by the company.</p>

<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) down 0.4% (at break)<br/>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.2%<br/>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.2%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) down 0.2%<br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.1%<br/>Taipei (Taiex) up 0.1%</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-central-bank-girds-for-a-wider-yuan-trading-range-2014-02-26">As expected</a>, China has widened the daily trading band for the yuan’s value against the dollar. For the most part, economic circles are greeting the move with a yawn, though the consensus is that this could slow (or just maybe even stop) the Chinese currency’s long, upward crawl in the near term.</p>
<p>First of all, there seems to be agreement that this isn’t a very big deal in the grand scheme of things. This, because the central bank will still set its desired “parity rate” (the level that determines the center of each day’s trading band, now widened to 2% above or below the parity rate).</p>
<p>Société Générale China economist Wei Yao says: “Widening the band is a relatively easy promise to deliver. The more difficult and more meaningful one is for the People’s Bank of China to really let go its control over the exchange rate.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams says: “If the PBOC was really confident that the renminbi [another name for the yuan] was now close to its market value, it would leave the reference rate to the market. But that still, apparently, remains a step too far.”</p>
<p>While the move may be small potatoes to some, many economists also say it’s not completely without consequence. Generally, they see the change to the trading band as more likely to weigh on China’s currency than to send it rising faster.</p>
<p>Although Standard Chartered said the wider band “does not have direct implications for medium-term yuan appreciation or depreciation dynamics,” it adds that the change makes their previous target for the yuan look “a little aggressive.”</p>
<p>As a result, StanChart now sees the dollar buying 6.02 yuan at the end of the third quarter, up from 5.98 yuan previously. On the other hand, the bank’s year-end projection remains at 5.92 yuan.</p>
<p>Over at Daiwa, they’re taking a stronger view that the yuan will now weaken — you can read the details of this argument in <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/now-for-more-yuan-weakness-2014-03-16">Craig Stephen’s “This Week in China” column</a>.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan also sees a weaker yuan, but just for the near term (they keep their year-end forecast at 5.95 yuan). They note that the last time the trading band was widened in 2012, the yuan fell in value for a short while. And certainly, we’ve seen some pullback for the yuan this month already.</p>
<p>Of course, any weakening in the Chinese currency helps Chinese exporters, and J.P. Morgan says a softer yuan would also stop those pesky hot-money inflows that has worried the PBOC recently. So maybe this is a good thing, for China at least.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) down 0.6%<br/>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.4%<br/>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 0.5%<br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.2%<br/>Taipei (Taiex) down 0.1%</p>
<p>Over in Hong Kong, there’s controversy stirring over the decision by China’s Alibaba Group to pick New York for its planned IPO, snubbing Hong Kong’s own market. </p>
<p>Or really it may have been Hong Kong’s decision: the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has a “one-share<wbr/>-one-vote” rule, and Alibaba reportedly refused to change its partnership structure that would allow Jack Ma, founder of the company, and its senior executives to keep control of the board even if the listing resulting in them holding less than a majority of all shares outstanding.</p>
<p>On Monday, Charles Li, the chief executive of Hong Kong’s bourse operator HKEx, said the exchange is proud of Hong Kong’s tradition of “respect for the rule of law and adherence to principles.” </p>
<p>But Li also said HKEx needs to be “more responsive and competitive, particularly with respect to new-economy or technology companies.”</p>
<p>“We have to consider possible changes where they might be necessary, with everything according to our due process,” he said.</p>
<p>Li also said the bourse’ listing committee would continue working on its rules for shareholding structures, a discussion which “didn’t start because of Alibaba and will not end now because of Alibaba.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Japanese investors were quite nervous as tensions mounted in Ukraine after the referendum in Crimea Sunday. The Nikkei index dropped 0.4% to close at 14,277.67, and the Topix index ended 0.8% lower at 1,154.93.</p>
<p>The Nikkei’s losses were capped by a 4.9% jump in shares of SoftBank Corp, which is heavily weighted in the Nikkei. The telecom company drew buyers’ interest after the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, where SoftBank has a 37% stake, just announced plans for a U.S. IPO.</p>
<p>Japanese retailer Aeon Co. sank 4.3%, after the company on Friday cut its profit estimate by nearly 20% for the  fiscal year that ended Feb. 28. </p>
<p>Tech manufacturers declined broadly, as NEC Corp. tumbled 3.2%, Nikon and Fanuc Corp. shed 1.7%, and Fujitsu Ltd. fell 1.4%.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) down 0.4% (closed)<br/>Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.2%<br/>Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 1%<br/>Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) down 0.2% (closed)<br/>Seoul (Kospi) up 0.4% (closed)<br/>Taipei (Taiex) up 0.1% (closed)</p>
<p>Chinese stocks closed at the highest level in a week after China’s government over the weekend announced plans to invest more in urbanization. </p>
<p>The 2014-2020 urbanization plan released on Sunday aims to boost migration from the countryside to urban areas, in efforts to lift incomes and domestic consumption. As part of the plan, Beijing seeks to increase the number of city residents by almost 1.4 billion by 2020, according to Reuters. </p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite Index closed up 1% at 2,023.67.</p>
<p>Japan (Nikkei Average) down 0.4% (closed)<br/> Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index) down 0.3% (closed)<br/> Shanghai (Shanghai Composite Index) up 1% (closed)<br/> Sydney (S&amp;P/ASX 200) down 0.2% (closed)<br/> Seoul (Kospi) up 0.4% (closed)</p>
