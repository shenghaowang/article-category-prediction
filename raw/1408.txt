<p>The Bank of England will never fully unwind its £375 billion emergency programme to pump cash into the economy, Governor Mark Carney said today.</p>
<p>Threadneedle Street embarked on the unprecedented policy of quantitative easing — buying up government debt with electronically created money — in the depths of the recession five years ago as the Monetary Policy Committee slashed interest rates to an all-time low of 0.5%.</p>
<p>Questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee over reversing the policy, Carney said the eventual sale of its gilt stocks would have an “impact” on debt markets but added: “We’re not going to sell £375 billion of gilts. That’s a hypothetical question, purely hypothetical.”</p>
<p>The Canadian added that the “world has changed” and that the size of the Bank’s balance sheet — swollen by the gilt purchases — would be “materially” larger going forward.</p>

<p>Carney added that he did not expect the process of unwinding QE to begin until there had been “several adjustments” in interest rates — suggesting it could take years.</p>
<p>He wants to have the flexibility to cut interest rates again should the recovery hit a sudden hurdle. It would be “more difficult” to adjust QE, but “interest rates are something we could move quickly”.</p>
<p>Carney said his personal view was that there was more slack in the labour market than the 1%-1.5% central view of the MPC. Rate-setter Martin Weale meanwhile said the rapid slide in unemployment towards the Bank’s current 7% threshold for forward guidance had “reinforced” his doubts over the policy.</p>
