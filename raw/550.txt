<p class="speakable-paragraph">Billionaire William Ackman’s Pershing Square hedge fund owns big equity stakes in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as part of a bet that efforts in Washington could yield massive returns from the two government-sponsored entities. But on Tuesday, as Ackman was jumping on a conference call to slam the practices of Herbalife, a company he has been lobbying against in Washington, the shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plunged.</p>
<p>Shares of Fannie Mae fell by 32% and shares of Freddie Mac fell by more than 28% on Tuesday after U.S. senators in Washington announced a bipartisan agreement that could lead to the shutdown of the mortgage giants, which have been operating under government conservatorship. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson and Senator Mike Crapo are behind the plan announced Tuesday that calls for a new government insurer to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>

<p>The new measure in Washington, which was put together with help from the White House, has at the very least stalled the recent boom in the stocks of Fannie and Freddie. Shares of the GSEs have soared this year on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board, putting a positive charge in the returns of hedge funds like Pershing Square. Still, shares of Fannie Mae are up a huge 32% this year. They are up by more than a 1,000% since the Fannie and Freddie penny stock boom started about a year ago.</p>

<p>The Obama Administration has long planned to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but now that the U.S. government has received more back from the GSEs than the $188 billion the government used to bail them out, there has been added momentum to the investor campaign in Washington and the courts that could bring enormous value to the shares of Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>Ackman’s big position is in the common shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Other prominent money managers like Richard Perry and Bruce Berkowitz are betting more on the preferred securities of the mortgage giants. Trading in all these shares has been very volatile in the last year as investors react to bumps in both Washington and the courts. The ups and downs in the preferred shares, however, which receive preferred treatment to the common share, have been a little less extreme. Shares of the popularly traded preferred series S fell by 3% on Tuesday.</p>
