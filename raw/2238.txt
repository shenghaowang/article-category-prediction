<p>MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank by assets, is confident it has done more to clean up its balance sheet than what will be required to get a clean bill of health from European regulators, its CEO Federico Ghizzoni said. </p>
<p>UniCredit posted a shock 14-billion euro loss for 2013 after massive writedowns on past acquisitons and rising bad loans. </p>
<p>It said the clean-up was an autonomous decision and was not dictated by the sector-wide health check being conducted by the European Central Bank. </p>
<p>UniCredit is cutting its workforce by 8,500 units by 2018, with more than 5,700 job cuts in Italy. </p>
<p>“I believed the group has turned the page. We could have staggered the losses on several years, we decided to take them all in one year,” Ghizzoni told reporters. </p>
<p>“I am serene we have done more than what will be required by the AQR.” </p>
<p>He said the bank did not plan any merger with other lenders and confirmed it would issue an additional Tier 1 bond by mid-2014 to boost its capital base. </p>
