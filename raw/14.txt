<p>Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower
open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment
data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China
weighed on sentiment.</p>
<p>Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&amp;P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall,
while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.</p>
<p>The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy
added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000
new jobs.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese
exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February,
confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of
10.6% in January.</p>
<p>A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.</p>
<p>The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy.</p>
<p>Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced
Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive
Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about
30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than
PCs.</p>
<p>That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in
2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in
pre-market trade, down 0.25%.</p>
<p>The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following
reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government
vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel
supplier.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts
awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net
loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended
September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal
2012.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a
777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia
Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.</p>
<p>Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters,
scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to
higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.58%, France's CAC 40 advanced
0.87%, Germany's DAX slipped 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained
0.41%.</p>
<p>During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
tumbled 1.75%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index lost 1.01%.</p>
