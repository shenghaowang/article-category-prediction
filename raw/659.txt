<p>NEW YORK — Looks like the best suitor won.</p>
<p>After an extended chase that included overtures on both sides and flirtations with other parties, Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank will combine to create the nation's fourth-largest menswear retail chain.</p>
<p>Men's Wearhouse Inc. is buying its rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. for $1.8 billion. The company will pay $65 a share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank's Monday closing price of $61.83. Jos. A. Bank also said it's terminating its deal to acquire the parent company of Eddie Bauer, which sells rugged outerwear.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes after months of the two chains publicly fighting over who would acquire whom. Industry watchers had speculated that a merger was inevitable given the challenges the companies face in the competitive menswear landscape. With more than 1,700 U.S. stores and $3.5 billion in annual sales, the combined company's reach in men's clothing will fall behind only Macy's, Kohl's and J.C. Penney.</p>
<p>Jos. A. Bank made the first move in October when it offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion. Men's Wearhouse shot down that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion. But after Jos. A. Bank turned down that bid, Men's Wearhouse increased its offer to $1.6 billion, and then again to $1.78 billion.</p>
<p>In the middle of the back-and forth, Jos. A. Bank said last month that it was buying Everest Holdings LLC, the parent company of Eddie Bauer. But the company left the door open for a deal with Men's Wearhouse by saying if it received a superior acquisition offer, it would pay a termination fee to end the Eddie Bauer deal.</p>
<p>By early March, Men's Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 a share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 a share if some conditions were met. Then, a few days later, the companies announced they were exchanging certain confidential information with each other.</p>
<p>Despite the rough courting period, both companies say they expect a smooth integration. In a joint news release, they said shareholders of both companies will benefit from about $100 million to $150 million in savings realized over three years as the company streamlines its duplicative corporate functions and improves sourcing and merchandising.</p>
<p>Analysts say there's a bright future for the combined company. The suit business, which generated $2.3 billion in revenue last year, has been relatively healthy. It's been up 4 percent over the past three years, according to market research firm NPD Group, fueled in part by tight-fitting varieties that have attracted young males.</p>
<p>The companies also have complementary businesses. Men's Wearhouse, which sells men's sportswear and suits through its 1,200 stores at its Men's Wearhouse, Moores and K&amp;G chains, caters to young male customers looking for their first suit. Meanwhile, Jos. A. Banks focuses on a more established clientele that's looking for a good deal at its 623 stores with promotions like "buy one suit or sport coat and get three free."</p>
