lost more than 1% on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of
China's economy dampened demand for riskier assets.</p>
<p>The Asian nation is the world's second largest oil consumer
after the U.S. and has been the engine of strengthening demand.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for delivery in April fell to a session low of $100.86 a
barrel, the lowest since March 6.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>WTI crude prices last traded at $101.13 a barrel during U.S.
morning hours, down 1.4%, or $1.45. The April contract rose 1%, or
$1.02 a barrel, on Friday to settle at $102.58.</p>
<p>Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.13 a
barrel, the low from March 6 and resistance at $102.91 a barrel,
the high from March 7.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil
futures for April delivery slumped 1.05%, or $1.16, to trade at
$107.84 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude
contracts stood at $6.71 a barrel.</p>
<p>Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing
expectations for a 6.8% increase.</p>
<p>Imports rose 10.1%, compared to forecasts for an 8% increase.
According to customs data, China's February crude oil imports
totaled 23.05 million metric tons, down 18.1% from January.</p>
<p>The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February.</p>
<p>A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China
rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations,
while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts
for a 1.9% drop.</p>
<p>The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy, and overshadowed last Friday's
stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs report for February.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, the Labor
Department reported, well above expectations for 149,000 new
jobs.</p>
