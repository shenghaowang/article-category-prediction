<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Chiquita Brands International of the US and Fyffes 
of Ireland </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">said today they 
have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction valued at about $1.07bn, that 
will be the world’s largest banana company.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Chiquita shareholders would own 50.7% of the new company, ChiquitaFyffes, which 
would have $4.6bn in annual revenue and 32,000 employees globally, Fyffes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">Wikipedia says Chiquita is 
the final name in a long list of companies whose ultimate origin was the United 
Fruit Company</span>, formed in 1899 by the merging of the Boston Fruit 
Company and various fruit exporting concerns controlled by Minor C. Keith. In 
1970 it became the United Brands Company when it was purchased by Eli Black. He 
outbid two other conglomerates, Zapata Corporation and Textron, for a 
controlling interest in the company. In fact, that is a condensed version of 
what has actually happened to United Fruit Co., famed in the U.S. for Chiquita 
bananas, but known to generations of Latin Americans as "el Pulpo" (the 
Octopus). In 1990 the company became Chiquita Brands International.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The original “<a href="http://users.polisci.wisc.edu/LA260/bananas.htm" target="_blank">Banana 
Republic</a>” was Honduras: United Fruit Company had many banana plantations, 
practically controlled the country economically and got involved in politics as 
well. Since the term was coined, the word has grown to be applied to any country 
with unstable, non-democratic governments, and abundant foreign influence, 
especially in economics. The many countries in Latin America that were dominated 
by United Fruit Company (UFCo) in the first half of the 20th century certainly 
fit that definition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The New York Times
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/books/review/Kurtz-Phelan-t.html?_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">
wrote </a>in 2008:</span> [Today, “the banana is the world’s fourth major food, 
after rice, wheat and milk.” But when a Brooklyn-born twentysomething named 
Minor Keith planted a few banana cuttings next to a railroad track in Costa Rica 
in the early 1870s, it was virtually unknown outside its native environs. Keith 
and his partners soon realized how great the potential profits were — especially 
if, along with growing bananas, they could control railroads, shipping and 
Central American governments (to that end, Keith married the beautiful daughter 
of a Costa Rican president). Only then did they set out to turn the banana into 
a product for the masses. Until its demise a hundred years later, United Fruit 
controlled as much as 90% of the market.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Fyffes Announces merger with Chiquita, FY13 numbers in-line:</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Patrick Higgins 
of Goodbody comments - - "Fyffes announced this morning that it will combine 
with Chiquita in a stock for stock  transaction. This will result in Fyffes shareholders holding 49.3% of the new 
entity,  ChiquitaFyffes plc. The group will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and 
domiciled in  Ireland. The merger will create the largest player globally, with c.14% market 
share. The  transaction values Fyffes at €1.22, a 38% premium to current levels.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The new company will have an equity value of c. $1.1bn and net debt of $576m. 
Combined  EBITDA is $174m, with an additional $40m expected in synergies. Another synergy 
benefit  from the transaction is on the balance sheet. Chiquita was highly leveraged at 
4.7x EBITDA,  the new entity will have a more manageable net debt / EBITDA of 2.7x. Fyffes 
management  will have governance of the new entity also, with David McCann to be appointed 
the new  CEO, Tom Murphy the new CFO and Coen Boss the new COO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Fyffes reported FY13 results this morning with EPS in-line with our forecasts 
at 8.8c, +3.1%  yoy. Sales came in at €839m, +7% , while adjusted EBITA was €32.7m (vs Goodbody
 €31.9m), at the top end of the guidance range of €29-€34m.   Banana sales were up in the year as the group continued to grow volumes; however 
profits  were down slightly due primarily to higher fruit costs. Pricing was weak in H1 
although a  significant pick up occurred during the summer months due a tightening of 
supply. Overall  pricing increased but insufficiently to offset the continuing rise in fruit 
costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Melons, which is predominantly H1 weighted, performed strongly as the group 
continues to  grow its market share in the key import season in the US. Profits in Fyffes 
pineapple  business rose strongly benefitting from an improvement in market conditions and 
stability in  supply volumes, particularly in H1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Current trading has been satisfactory in the year to date, although pricing 
is behind  year on year. As a result and given the potential for volatility in the core 
banana  business over the course of the year, management has set a wide initial guidance
 range for adjusted EBITA of €30-35m (vs. Goodbody forecasts for €33.7m). At 
first  glance, we are unlikely to change our forecasts."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) 
</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">announced that it will hold a 
bond auction on Thursday, 13 March, the first such auction since 21 September 
2010.<br>
<br>
			
			Speaking today, <span style="font-weight: bold;">John Corrigan, NTMA chief executive</span> said: “The resumption 
of scheduled bond auctions builds on the phased re-entry to the capital markets 
achieved by the NTMA over the past two years and marks the full normalisation of 
Ireland’s presence in the markets.”<br>
<br>
			
			The details of the bond auction on 13 March are as follows:<br>
<br>
			
			Bond to be auctioned: 
3.40% Treasury Bond 2024<br>
<br>
			
			Auction size: 
€1bn<br>
<br>
			
			The auction will be conducted on the Bloomberg Auction System and will be 
confined to recognised primary dealers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Escher Group FY13 results statement highlights positive pipeline: 
</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rachael of 
Goodbody comments - - "Escher Group has announced FY13 results this morning. 
Revenue of $24.7m had already  been reported in the group’s trading statement in January while adjusted EBITDA 
came in at  $4.2m (company definition), 5% ahead of the $4m guidance given in January. Adj. 
EPS  came in at 4.8c versus our 5.6c forecast with a higher interest and tax charges 
the key  differences.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">License revenue was $5.1m, -19% yoy, and -5% versus our forecast. The 
statement notes  that the yoy performance was impacted by the fact that the group received 
licence revenue  from Malaysia in the prior year but this was somewhat offset by the extension of 
the number  of licences in the Saudi Post contract and ongoing payments received from USPS. 
In  addition, this revenue was held back by the delay of the USPS licence fee in 
2013. The group  remains confident of recognising this revenue in H114 (c. $6m). Maintenance 
revenue was  $5.4m, +6% yoy, driven by the full year impact of customers signed in 2012. 
Support  revenue was -11% yoy to $2.5m, which reflected a contract renewal done during 
the year.  In terms of services revenue, it was +35% yoy to $11.6m, versus our $10.3m 
forecast,  driven by the group's work with the USPS and the Malaysian post office. Gross 
profit margin  (61% v 66% in 2012) was impacted by the revenue mix which was more weighted 
towards  the lower margin services revenue during the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">On current trading and outlook, for the Riposte division (postal software) 
the statement  notes that the group has been in contact with several postal organisations and 
is confident of  signing new customers in 2014. Within Escher Interactive Services (digital mail 
and mobile  wallet solutions), it notes that the pipeline of opportunities has expanded 
significantly over  the last 12 months and Escher remains confident about the prospects for 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Overall, we are unlikely to make any significant changes to FY14 forecasts
 following this morning’s announcement. It is encouraging to see the group note 
the  pipeline of potential deals for both of its divisions. While we have c.3 wins in 
our  forecasts per annum for its postal software division already, further traction 
in its  interactive services division could see upside to group forecasts and our price
 target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Banks: SME survey indicates uptick in loan refusal rate; 
</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Eamonn Hughes and 
Colm Foley comment - - "The latest Quarterly Bank Watch Survey at the end of 
February by ISME, the small and  medium sized enterprises association, has shown that refusal rates by banks to 
lend to small  businesses rose by 4 points to 54%. The survey of 924 owner-managers of SMEs 
also found  that 60% of respondents had increased of bank charges imposed on them whilst 18% 
had  incurred increased interest rates.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The uptick in refusals comes against the background of the improving economy 
and the  previous quarterly survey which reported an improving refusal rate from 58% to 
50%.  Indeed, credit standards in the most recent Central Bank input to the EU Bank 
Lending  Survey highlighted unchanged credit standards for the SME sector in Q413 whilst 
there was  an expectation that standards in Q114 would also be unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The quick reversal in the refusal rate is surprising and something we’ll need 
to  monitor, but ongoing evidence of an improving economy highlights that, on  balance, conditions for the SME sector should be showing some signs of  improvement. Evidence of higher charges is also likely to flow through to better
 income for the banks in due course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Economic View: GDP data likely to confirm investment-led recovery</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">; Dermot 
O'Leary of Goodbody comments - - "Positive momentum in the Irish economy is 
expected to be confirmed by this week’s Q4 2013  GDP data. A key feature of recent quarters, and indeed of our forecasts for the 
coming years,  is that a rebound in investment is leading recovery in domestic demand. This 
should be a  feature of the Q4 2013 data.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">For 2013 as a whole, we are forecasting that GDP grew by 0.4%, following a 
0.2% expansion  in 2012. On first glance, therefore, describing Ireland as a “growth beacon” 
would be very  much an exaggeration. However, the “patent cliff” in the pharmaceutical sector 
has played a  significant role in depressing GDP growth over that period; we estimate 1.0% to 
1.5%. More  encouraging is the trend in domestic demand. In Q3 2013, domestic demand, 
excluding the  volatile aircraft component, grew by 1.6%, its fastest rate of growth since 
2007. Within this,  investment grew by 8% yoy, with contributions from both business machinery and
 equipment and construction. Surveys over recent months suggest that trends in 
the former  continued, while momentum in the construction sector has also been maintained 
(confirmed  by this morning’s PMI). After falling for the first three quarters of the year, 
we expect  consumer spending to make a small contribution to growth in Q4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Another key aspect of the GDP data that we will be watching closely is the 
nominal  data, as they will act as an input into the deficit and debt to GDP 
calculations. News  on this front has been slightly disappointing of late, owing to very low 
inflationary  pressures. The key theme of the data though should be one of an improving, and
 indeed better quality, economic recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt;">Irish and European industry continues to recover in 2014:</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Conall Mac Coille 
of Davy comments - - "European stock indices fell on Friday: the Euro Stoxx 50 
fell 1.6% and the S&amp;P500 rose 0.1%. On-going tensions over Crimea held back risk 
appetite despite better-than- expected US non-farm payrolls at 175,000. US 
Treasury yields jumped on the news to above 2.8% from 2.72%. The euro rose to a 
fresh high against the dollar, breaking through $1.39 in early trade, as 
investors weighed the ECB’s decision to keep rates on hold.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">German industrial production grew by 5.0% in the year to January 2014, well 
above expectations. French data released this morning show manufacturing up 1.4% 
on the year. Italian figures will be released at 09.00 this morning. Given the 
strength of euro area manufacturing PMI surveys (53.2 in February) and the hard 
data on output, the consensus forecast for just 1.9% euro area industrial 
production growth in 2014 looks overly pessimistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In this context, Friday’s industrial production data for Ireland provided 
further evidence that the sector is benefitting from the improving cycle in 
Europe. Irish industrial production fell by 1.1% in the year to January but was 
split between a 5.3% fall in the modern sector and a 7.8% rise in traditional 
manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Output in the labour-intensive traditional sector (accounting for two-thirds, 
or 137,100, of total industrial sector employment of 200,000), is gradually 
recovering, broadly in tandem with the broader European sector. In contrast, the 
pharmaceutical sector has been hurt by the patent cliff. However, pharmaceutical 
companies employ just 40,000 and have responded to the patent cliff by 
increasing investment in plant and R&amp;D to bring the next generation of drugs to 
market. So, even within the pharmaceutical sector, there has been no evidence of 
aggregate job cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Separately, new cars licensed in February were up 23% on 2013 levels and new 
goods vehicles licensed were up by 45%. This provides further evidence that the 
rebound in Irish consumer and business confidence has led households and 
companies to increase their spending. Indeed, the surge in Irish consumer 
confidence through H2 2013 was accompanied by a pick-up in surveys on 
households’ intentions to spend on big ticket items such as cars."</span></p>
