<p>Why is it that so many major physician organizations endorse the <a href="http://topics.lehighvalleylive.com/tag/affordable%20care%20act/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a>? It’s not because it makes it easier or more profitable for physicians.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that people without health insurance are less likely to take medicines they need, get less preventative care and are at greater risk for preventable death. They also experience higher costs when they access health care. For example, only 30 percent of uninsured women get mammograms vs. 50 percent of insured women. Fifty four percent of uninsured persons forgo treatment, prescriptions and follow-up doctor appointments vs. 21 percent of the insured. Uninsured persons are four times more likely to be hospitalized for conditions such as asthma, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and ulcers, and most of these hospitalizations are related to lack of preventative care and regular doctor visits, according to a study by the American College of Physicians.</p>
<p>If you are uninsured, you’re not the only one at risk. Your families may place themselves at risk to help pay your bills. Your co-workers suffer when you call in sick more often. Society suffers from supporting unnecessary disability payments or to sustain hospitals providing unpaid care.</p>
<p>Now is the time to sign up for health insurance! Shop for a plan that meets your needs and receive tax credits in many cases. Go to healthcare.gov or call 800-318-2596. But you have to sign up by March 31. Otherwise, you must wait until November.</p>
