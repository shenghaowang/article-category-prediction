Consumer confidence in the US unexpectedly dropped in March to a four-month low, indicating household spending may be slow to pick up from a weather-related setback earlier this year.
</p>
<p>The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of sentiment fell to 79.9 this month from 81.6 in February.</p>
<p>The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for the measure to increase to 82.</p>
<p>Consumers surveyed were more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy.</p>
<p>At the same time, fewer job cuts and higher home values will help keep sentiment from faltering.</p>
