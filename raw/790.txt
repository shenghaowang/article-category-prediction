<p><b>WASHINGTON</b> - Sports injuries sent nearly 2 million people to U.S. emergency rooms in 2012 and the cost can be particularly devastating  for young people without insurance, the administration said Tuesday.</p>
<p>With a shortage of young people signing up for <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/obamacare/" target="_blank">Obamacare</a>, the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of Health and Human Services</a> <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-harnesses-march-madness-to-promote-obamacare/" target="_blank">is using March Madness</a> to urge basketball and other sports fans to enroll in a health care plan by the March 31 deadline.<br/></p>
<p>The most common sports injuries were ankle or knee sprains and leg fractures, according to the new data. The estimated rates of sports-related injuries were higher among children and young adults under the age of 25.</p>
<p>An estimated 12 million people between the ages of 5 and 22 years suffer a sports-related injury annually, the data found. About 20 percent of all injury-related ER visits involve children and teens aged 6 to 19. <br/></p>
<p>It can be costly to treat even a minor sports injury, HHS said. For instance, a sprained ankle can cost a person $2,20, while charges for a broken arm average nearly $7,700.</p>
<p>"Whether you're out on the slopes or playing the boss in a pickup game of basketball after that stressful meeting, you don't want to have to hold back because you aren't covered in case of injury," she said.</p>

<p>Miami Heat forward and former Duke University star Shane Battier told reporters during a press conference Tuesday that he's personally had over 90 stitches, 25 ankle sprains, over 50 X-rays and MRIs and now has early-onset arthritis from his athletic career.</p>
<p>"There is a health risk that comes from playing sports...chances are you're going to get banged up at some point," he said. "Play hard, be smart and get covered."</p>
