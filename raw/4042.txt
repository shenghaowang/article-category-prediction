<p class="detailsnews">The Indian unit of Toyota Motor Corp on Sunday suspended production at two of its plants after salary negotiations between workers union and management failed to break the deadlock.</p>
<p class="detailsnews">Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) released a statement saying that it has locked out workers at the plants near Bangalore since Sunday. The statement did not reveal that when the lockout will end.<p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">"Over the past 25 days, some workers have stopped production lines and disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government failed to reach an agreement over salaries," TKM said. <p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">"The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," added the statement.<p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">Tokyo-based Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino said that talks will continue to resolve the issue. He added that the suspension of the operations would result in a production loss of 700 vehicles on a daily basis.<p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">TKM manufactures vehicles including the Fortuner and Innova at its 1st plant, which started its operation in 1997. The 2nd plant opened in 2010 and it manufactures the Etios and Corolla Altis. <p class="detailsnews">In a separate development, the government has increased the import tariff value on gold to $445 per 10 grams from at $433 per 10 gram.<p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">The import tariff value is the base price at which customs duty is determined to prevent under-invoicing. The import tariff value of silver has been reduced to $694 per kg from $699 per kg earlier, a notification by the Central Board of Excise and Customs said.<p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">The government revises tariff value on a fortnightly basis after analysing the global price trend. Several measures had been taken by the government in the recent past to curb gold import and check the rising current account deficit.<p class="detailsnews"> <p class="detailsnews">The jewellers body said that the measures taken by the government means that the total gold imports this fiscal will not be over 550 tonnes. It was 845 tonnes in the last fiscal.</p>
