<p>Sturdy performance across Anthropologie and Free People brands facilitated <strong>Urban Outfitters Inc</strong> . ( <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/urbn">URBN</a> ) to post better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2014results. The quarterly earnings of 59 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents and rose 5.4% year over year.  </p>
<p><strong>Revenue Insight</strong></p>
<p>Total net sales of Urban Outfitters climbed 5.7% to $905.9 million during the quarter, reflecting healthy comparable-store sales performance coupled with sturdy sales through new store openings and double-digit growth at its wholesale operations. However, total revenue of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $911 million.</p>
<p>Sales were affected due to sluggish performance of the Urban Outfitters brand attributable to adverse weather conditions and weak product execution. Moreover, management hinted that the headwinds faced by the Urban Outfitters brand may impact the performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As a result, shares dropped 2.7% during the after-market trading session yesterday.</p>
<p>Urban Outfitters' net sales increased 4.9% to $858 million at the Retail Segment and 23.7% to $47.9 million at the Wholesale Segment.

<p><strong>Margin Performance</strong></p>
