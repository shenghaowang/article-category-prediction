<p>Toasted sandwich chain Quiznos <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/14/news/companies/quiznos-bankruptcy/" rel="nofollow">filed for protection from bankruptcy last Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Restaurant executives of the Denver-based chain said they are implementing a restructuring plan that will cut their debt by more than $400 million.</p>
<p>Of Quizno's 2,100 restaurants in the United States, only seven are not independently-owned and are operated by franchises. The company said that those who are will not be effected by the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>At one time, Quiznos used to be a top dog in the sub sandwich market, owning 5,000 stores and directly competing with Subway. Now, Subway has eclipsed its former rival, owning over 40,000 stores worldwide.</p>
<p>Quiznos is just the latest fast food chain that has fallen as a result of the recession. Just last week, pizza restaurant Sbarro also filed for protection from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>"It's a survival of the fittest," said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of food research firm Technomic Inc, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-14/business/chi-quiznos-bankruptcy--20140314_1_bankruptcy-filing-subway-restaurants-debt" rel="nofollow">as reported by the Chicago Tribune</a>. "The market is not growing, or it's barely growing, so the weak players are getting weeded out."</p>
<p>Quiznos originally garnered a lot of attention with its quirky commercials and a higher-end menu. Promoting the concept of toasted subs, the sandwiches at Quiznos offered more exciting choices than the generic, albeit cheaper, Subway.</p>
<p>"Quiznos really came out of the box with a better sandwich concept with a higher price point, which means many of the franchisees went into more expensive locations," said Darren Tristano of Technomic.</p>
<p>In the long run, cheaper won out. As the recession hit, Subway capitalized with its $5 foot long campaign. Quiznos on the other hand was forced to lower prices on top of keeping up with costs of premium menu items and high rent locations.</p>
<p>"They expanded too fast, they had a weak franchisee network," Bob Goldin said. "Once the Paneras of the world came along, I think, many consumers thought that was a better quality price point. And Subway came in on the lower end and aggressively promoted themselves as fresh."</p>
<p>Quiznos CEO Stuart Manthis said that the company will now invest in the independently-owned franchises, lowering food prices and increasing local advertising.  </p>
