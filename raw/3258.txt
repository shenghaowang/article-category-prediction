<p>Federal Reserve officials are discussing ways to revise their guidance about the likely future path of interest rates, but it takes some detective work to pin down how they might do it. </p>
<p>The Fed has said in its recent policy statements it won’t start raising short-term interest rates from near zero until well past the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. That position hasn’t changed. But with joblessness at 6.7% in February, several officials have indicated in recent speeches and interviews they might want to scrap the threshold entirely or revamp their message in other ways. </p>
<p>Fed policy makers will debate the matter at their meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, though reaching agreement on a new approach could be a challenge. </p>
<p>The options some officials have mentioned include offering broad assurances, not a numerical threshold, for considering when to raise rates; citing a wider array of measures to consider when assessing when to raise rates; and providing more information about how much they would raise rates after they start the process. </p>
<p>“This is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6 1/2 % threshold because it’s not really providing any great value,” New York Fed President William Dudley said in an interview earlier this month. The 6.5% threshold is “a little bit obsolete.” </p>
