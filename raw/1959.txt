<p>SHANGHAI: The Chinese yuan weakened in opening deals on Monday after the central bank doubled the currency's permitted trading band, a move analysts said was a clear signal authorities are ready to allow market forces to play a greater role in the economy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The spot yuan opened at 6.1500 per dollar, 0.29% away from the official midpoint rate, and it soon slid to 6.1617 per dollar, down 0.19% from Friday's market close.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The central bank set the midpoint at 6.1321 on Monday morning, 0.04% firmer than Friday's fix.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the People's Bank of China doubled the yuan's daily trading range, so that it can now rise or fall 2% from the daily midpoint rate, although in early deals it held with the previous band of +/- 1%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first quote in the foreign exchange trading system was initially reported at 6.1573, but that was later revised to 6.1500.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the offshore yuan (CNH) was priced at 6.1555 per dollar, 0.1% stronger than the onshore market. The offshore yuan market is not bound by the midpoint rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Analysts said the wider trading band was a sign of confidence the central bank had successfully fought off a plague of currency speculators. It was also seen as a signal that regulators believe the economy is stable enough to handle more promised reforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The yuan had ended trading on Friday at 6.15 per dollar and one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts, considered the best available proxy for market expectations of the yuan's future value, were pricing the yuan at 6.2120.</p>

<p>Authorities have been trying to change the perception the yuan was a certain one-way bet by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The yuan rose 2.9% against the dollar in 2013, outperforming other emerging economy currencies, in a rally that encouraged more one-way bets and led to a dramatic crack down by the central bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, since the beginning of 2014, the central bank had pushed the currency down 1.6% by Friday's close. While not a major move for many currencies, for the yuan it marked a bigger slide than over six months during the Greek debt crisis in 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The currency is not the only uncertainty for investors. Earlier this month, a Chinese company became the first to default on a corporate bond, and worries of slowing economic growth were highlighted by a dramatic 18% fall in exports in February and sluggish manufacturing. – Reuters </p>
