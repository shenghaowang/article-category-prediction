<p>LONGMONT, Colo. — A Longmont-based earth-imagery company is asking computer users to scan and tag images of more than 1,200 square miles of ocean for any visible evidence that could help locate the Malaysia Airlines 777 aircraft that went missing this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25315311/digitalglobe-launches-crowdsource-search-missing-malaysian-plane">The Denver Post reports</a> that DigitalGlobe has directed two of its satellites to snap photos of areas in the Gulf of Thailand, where investigators suspect the plane may have crashed. The company is asking the public to report any evidence of a crash.</p>
<p>Flight MH370, with 239 people on board, lost communication while on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The missing plane continues to perplex investigators.</p>
