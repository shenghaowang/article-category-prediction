<p>Spot gold fell as much as 1.5pc to a session low of $1,329.35 an ounce, and was trading down 1.2pc at $1,335.20 by 1527 GMT.</p>
<p>Gold futures for April delivery fell $16.70 to$1,335.00 an ounce.</p>
<p>The metal, seen as a safe haven, was still on track for a fifth straight week of gains, capitalising on gains made earlier in the week when tensions in Ukraine escalated.</p>
