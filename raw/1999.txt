<p>Virtu Financial, a high-frequency electronic trading firm and
  market maker, filed on Monday with the SEC to raise up to $100
  million in an initial public offering, although the deal
  size is likely just a placeholder. We estimate it could raise as
  much as $250 million. The New York , NY-based company, which
  was founded in 2008 and booked $665 million in sales for the
  fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, plans to list on the NASDAQ
  under the symbol VIRT. Virtu Financial initially filed
  confidentially on December 26, 2013. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan,
  Sandler O'Neill, Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, Citi, Credit
  Suisse and UBS are the joint bookrunners on the deal. No pricing
  terms were disclosed.</p>
