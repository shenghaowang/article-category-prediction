<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">WASHINGTON (AP) — A plan to phase out government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and instead use mainly private insurers to backstop home loans has advanced in Congress.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">The agreement by two key senators and a White House endorsement sent shares of Fannie and Freddie sinking Tuesday. Fannie stock fell $1.79, or more than 30%, to $4.03. Freddie dropped $1.48, or 26.8%, to $4.04.</p>
<p class="p-text">The plan would create a new government insurance fund. Investors would pay fees in exchange for insurance on mortgage securities they buy. The government would become a last-resort loan guarantor.</p>
<p class="p-text p-text-last" id="article-body-p-last">President Barack Obama proposed an overhaul of Fannie and Freddie last year, but Congress has struggled to craft legislation. The government rescued the two mortgage giants with an $187 bailout, which they have repaid.</p>
