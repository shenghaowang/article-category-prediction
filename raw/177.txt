<p>NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell in afternoon trading on Tuesday after swinging between gains and losses for most of the session as the lack of major corporate earnings or market-affecting data kept trading directionless. </p>
<p>U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in January, as companies built up stocks of autos and machinery, but sales posted their largest decline in nearly five years. </p>
<p>Retailers in the news included American Eagle and Urban Outfitters, their shares down sharply after disappointing outlooks. </p>
<p>“When you get a slow data week, markets tend to get a little jittery and slow,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “The market has been up very quickly and is sort of waiting for a next catalyst.” </p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.93 points or 0.29 percent, to 16,371.75, the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.04 points or 0.32 percent, to 1,871.13 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.349 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,323.099. </p>
<p>Urban Outfitters dropped 5 percent to $35.65 after it reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and said it was “very cautious” on its current quarter. American Eagle Outfitters slumped 6.4 percent to $13.30 after it forecast earnings for the current quarter that were short of expectations. </p>
<p>The S&amp;P retail index slipped 0.4 percent. </p>
<p>Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc advanced 4.6 percent to $56.84 after the company posted fourth-quarter earnings and gave its first-quarter outlook. </p>
<p>Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange hit their lowest level since July 2010 under pressure from rising inventories of the metal and slow demand.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold fell 1 percent, bringing the decline in the past four sessions to 8.4 percent. </p>
<p>Myriad Genetics Inc lost 8.7 percent to $34.46. The diagnostics company said a U.S. court denied a motion that would have stopped rival Ambry Genetics Corp from selling a similar version of Myriad’s cancer test. </p>
<p>Men’s Wearhouse said it would acquire rival Jos. A. Bank Clothiers for about $1.8 billion, ending a five-month saga that started with Jos. A. Bank offering to buy its larger menswear rival. Men’s Wearhouse shares rose 5.4 percent to $57.56 and Jos. A. Bank added 4 percent to $64.31. </p>
<p>“M&amp;A activity has been picking up, and it tends to offer a halo effect on sectors and subsectors involved,” said Krosby, pointing to a broad support to the market coming from mergers and acquisitions lately. </p>
<p>J.C. Penney Co Inc jumped 5.8 percent to $8.91 after Citigroup raised the stock to a “buy” and boosted its price target to $11 per share. </p>
<p>Boyd Gaming Corp jumped 16 percent to $13.69 a day after hedge fund Elliott International disclosed a 4.99 percent stake in the gaming company. </p>
<p>La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co surged 66.5 percent to $18.15 after the company said its lead experimental drug to treat chronic kidney disease met the main goal of improving kidney function in a mid-stage study. </p>
