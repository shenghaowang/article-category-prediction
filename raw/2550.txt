The popular sub sandwich chain has officially filed for pre-packaged bankruptcy protection.</em></p>
<p>The corporation filed on Friday (March 14) after struggling with high debt and heightening competition.</p>
<p>Quiznos says that by restricting, the chain would be able to cut its debt by more than $400 million.</p>
<p>It has been reported that all except 7 of its nearly 2,100 restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees. In a statement, the chain said that these restaurants will not be affected by the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Quiznos says it will seek court approval of a $15 million loan to continue operations as it restructures.</p>
