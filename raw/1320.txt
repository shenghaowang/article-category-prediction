<p>The maker of popular smartphone game “Candy Crush Saga” played it safe in pricing its IPO Wednesday amid growing concerns that too sweet of an offering could make investors sick.</p>
<p>King Digital Entertainment, the Dublin-based maker of “Candy Crush,” said it plans to sell 22.2 million shares priced at between $21 and $24 a share in its initial public offering.</p>
<p>That range values King Digital at up to $7.6 billion — slightly below the $9 billion valuation mobile gaming company Zynga sought when it went public in 2011.</p>
<p>Since announcing its IPO plans last month, King has been unable to shake comparisons to Zynga, which has watched its shares tumble close to 50 percent since going public — leaving its valuation at $4.7 billion.</p>
<p>King’s conservative valuation suggests the company and its bankers are worried about turning the stomachs of already wary investors.</p>
<p>“Candy Crush” was the most downloaded free app on Apple’s iTunes store last year. But Zynga’s “FarmVille” was all the rage at the time of its IPO.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, King said revenues in the fourth quarter dropped to $601.7 million from $621.1 million the previous quarter, which has some watchers worried that the “Candy Crush” fad is already fading.</p>
<p>“Candy Crush” accounted for 78 percent of King’s fourth-quarter revenue.</p>
<p>“The games business is no different than the movie business. One great hit doesn’t ensure that the next movie will be a hit,” said Doug Kass, founder of investment shop Seabreeze Partners Management.</p>
