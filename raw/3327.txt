<p><strong>DUBLIN —</strong> Yes, they have more bananas.</p>
<p>Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they have  agreed to merge, creating the world's biggest banana supplier.</p>
<p>The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.</p>
<p>The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.</p>
<p>Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.</p>
<p>The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. </p>
<p>ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.</p>
<p>Fyffes is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.</p>
<p>David McCann, Fyffes' chair, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chair.</p>
<p>Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."</p>
<p>However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.</p>
