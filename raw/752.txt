<p class="BodytextfirstparagraphStory">Europe’s main stock markets closed mixed yesterday as traders assessed unease over China and Ukraine in the absence of major regional data releases, analysts said.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">London’s FTSE 100 ended the day with a slight 0.06% dip to 6,685.52 points.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The Dax 30 in Frankfurt gained 0.46% to 9,307.79 points but Paris’s CAC 40 gave up 0.48% to 4,349.72 points compared with Monday’s closing values.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">Milan was up 0.39% after data confirming the Italian economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter last year after its longest post-war recession of more than two years.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">“UK and European shares were predominately down today as global growth concerns and possible Crimean conflict linger in the background,” said Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">Key forex dealers Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland slumped 2.42% and 3% respectively, ranking among London’s poorest performers as allegations of foreign exchange rigging returned to focus Tuesday.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">BoE governor Mark Carney told lawmakers that the case is “as serious as Libor, if not more so, because this goes to the heart of the integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets”.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">He also announced an overhaul of the central bank, saying a new deputy governor focusing on financial markets and banking will be appointed.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">Global markets suffered a sell-off on Monday in response to a shock trade deficit in China that raised concerns about the economy, second-biggest in the world, while Japan revised down its growth for 2013.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">US stocks pushed lower yesterday following a report showing a drop in small business sentiment.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.22% to stand at 16,381.85 points in midday trading.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The broad-based S&amp;P 500 gave up 0.20% to 1,873.50, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.08percent to 4,331.08.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The National Federation of Independent Business said its index of business confidence for February fell 2.7 points to 91.4, a reading associated with low growth.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">But some analysts downplayed the index’s fall, blaming it on the severe winter weather that has played a role in other recent poor economic data.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">In foreign exchange trading, the euro slid to $1.3862 from $1.3875 late in New York the day before.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The dollar eased to 103.11 yen from 103.26 yen.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold climbed to $1,346.25 an ounce from $1,344 on Monday.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">In Ukraine, the country’s Crimea peninsula yesterday voted for full independence ahead of a referendum to join Russia, while France threatened sanctions against Moscow as early as this week.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The latest escalation of Europe’s worst crisis for decades came moments after Ukraine’s ousted pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovych defiantly vowed to return to Kiev from Russia and declared he was still the leader of the ex-Soviet country.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">“The possibility of a war is forcing dealers to remain on the sidelines,” said David Madden, market analyst at traders IG.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">Meanwhile, emerging economies are expected to hold down global growth with their “sub-par” performance, the OECD forecast yesterday, warning that the risk of recent turmoil hitting developing markets could intensify.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">But advanced economies are expected to post strengthening growth, although at a slower pace in the first half of 2014 than in the second half of last year.</p>
<p class="BodytextStory">The good news from the developed world is being offset by a slowdown in emerging economies, some of which have seen massive capital outflows as the US began to “taper” its $85bn-a-month stimulus programme.</p>
