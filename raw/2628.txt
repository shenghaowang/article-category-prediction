<p>International exports from China fell by more than 18 percent last month as compared with the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Customs. That represents the sharpest losses since August 2009.</p>

"Still, the statistics that come from emerging markets tend to be a bit bumpy, with quite big swings, and the picture is still for higher growth than in mature economies."</p>
<p>At 9:38 a.m. on Monday, WTI crude oil futures fell 1.54 percent, a $1.58 loss to $101 per barrel. At 9:39 a.m., Brent crude oil futures slumped 1.07 percent, a $1.17 dip to $107.83 per barrel.</p>
