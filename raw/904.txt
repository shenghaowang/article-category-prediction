<p id="speakable-summary">Anonymous hackers have <a href="http://blog.magicaltux.net/2014/03/09/mtgox-2014-hack-database-revealed-live-from-mark-karpeless-reddit-account/#comments" target="_blank">defaced Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ blog</a> and have uploaded a data dump of customer data that, according to users with accounts on the site, is accurate. A Reddit user created an Excel spreadsheet <a href="https://letscrate.com/f/johnbiggs/mt-gox/xls-file/mtgox_balancies.xlsx.zip" target="_blank">[mirror]</a> of anonymized user accounts with balances, and many current <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/tag/mt-gox/">Mt.Gox</a> users have found their balances present.</p>
<p>The text of the post reads [NSFW]:</p>
<p>The most important number, obviously, is the 951,116.21905382 balance. As you recall, Mt.Gox <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2014/02/28/mt-gox-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed for bankruptcy while stating a 850,000 BTC loss.</a> This would suggest Karpeles’ estimates were off by a large margin. Whether all of this is accurate or not is an entirely different manner. What the leak does show us is how easy it was to grab nearly all of Mt.Gox’s user data as well as how hardened Karpeles’ blog was. Furthermore, the files contain the app Mt.Gox admins used to manage transfers. A screenshot appears below.</p>

<p>Who hacked Mt.Gox? The leak contains some clues. A visit to the above-mentioned mirror brings a link to the zip file and a note: “I hated working with you. You deserve everything you get for what you did.”</p>
