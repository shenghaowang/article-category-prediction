<p>Each year, about 13 or so journalists out of the 600 that generally attend the press conference following the end of the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting have been chosen to raise questions to the standing premier, according to a report by the Beijing News.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said that foreign media correspondents generally have had a better chance than their domestic counterparts to be chosen to ask questions during the occasion.</p>
<p>The NPC's information bureau explains the press conference for the Chinese premier after the annual session concludes was held with the idea that it would help the foreign media better understand China 's domestic and foreign policies. Therefore, they tend to invite foreign media to raise questions, rather than local reporters.</p>
