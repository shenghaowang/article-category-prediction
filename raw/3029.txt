<p>There's really no doubt that Comcast has its tendrils in deep when it comes to lobbying for approval of their $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable. The revolving door helps; former FCC boss Michael Powell now heads the NCTA, the cable industry's largest lobbying group. Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker, who voted for Comcast's acquisition of NBC while at the FCC, now lobbies the FCC for Comcast. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen formerly provided legal counsel for Comcast. </p>

Comcast PACs have given money to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and nearly all of the folks who'll be responsible with reviewing their merger application.</p>
<p>They've also donated to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, who'll be holding an upcoming merger hearing.</p>
