<p>Mortgage rate data from Freddie Mac, who publishes a weekly mortgage survey of more than 100 bank across the country, for the week of March 6th indicated that mortgage rates dropped substantially during the first week of March. Keep in mind that banks submit their "prime rates" (ie, their best offers) as part of the survey so your individual rate quote may vary. Prime borrowers are those with credit scores of 740 or higher who put 20% down and have an acceptable debt-to-income ratio. Here's what the rates looked like this week:</p>
<p>30 year fixed-rate mortgages saw their largest rate drop since November losing 0.09% points and currently sitting at 4.28%, the second lowest rate since we saw 4.23% back during the first week of February.</p>
<p>15 year fixed mortgage rates also fell. They ended the week down at 3.32% which is the lowest they've been since the 27th of November.</p>
<p>5 year adjustable rate mortgages ended up at 3.03% for the week. This also represents their low for the year and the lowest the rate has been since the last week of December 2013.</p>
<p>1 year adjustable rate mortgages held steady at 2.52%, 0.05% points off of their 2014 high.</p>
<p>For historical context, last year at this time the 30-year FRM was at 3.53%, the 15-year FRM at 2.77%, the 5-year ARM at 2.64%, and the 1-year ARM at 2.61%.</p>

<p>Even though it was a week light on economic report releases, mortgage rates were influenced by the March 7th jobs report where employers outperformed expectations and added 175,000 new jobs to the workforce.</p>
<p>According to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s Weekly Survey, mortgage applications for the week of March 6th increased 9.4 percent from the prior week once seasonal factors were taken into account. However, the mortgage loan application volume is still down 49.3 percent since this time last year and the refinance share of mortgages dropped to its lowest level in over six months at 57.7 percent. Adjustable rate mortgages remained at last weeks level of 8 percent of total mortgage applications.</p>
