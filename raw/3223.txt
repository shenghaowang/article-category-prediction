<p>Herbalife revealed on Wednesday that the Federal Trade Commission has opened a civil investigation into the practices of the nutrition company, which sells weight-loss shakes, vitamins and other products. </p>
<p>Moments after Herbalife made the announcement, its stock price plunged. At 1:51 p.m., it had lost 12 percent of its value. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/herbalife-discloses-civil-investigation-by-ftc.html">Bloomberg explains</a> that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman accused the company of running a pyramid scheme. Bloomberg adds:<br/></p>
<p>"The probe marks an achievement for Ackman, who in 2012 made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife's shares and started working to persuade regulators to shut the company down, saying it misleads distributors, misrepresents sales figures and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. The company has repeatedly denied Ackman's allegations and won allies including billionaire <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/carl-icahn/">Carl Icahn</a>. </p>
<p>"'Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,' the company said in the statement."<br/></p>
<p>NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/01/16/169468312/the-fight-over-herbalife">Planet Money took a look at Ackman's claims back in January</a>. As they reported, the "multilevel marketing" scheme used by Herbalife isn't new. Amway and Avon use the same kind of structure. Essentially, distributors make more money by making other people distributors. </p>
<p>But whether its illegal presents a complicated question:<br/></p>
<p>"Ackman argues that Herbalife is all about recruiting new distributors, and not about selling weight loss shakes and vitamins to real customers. </p>
<p>"Not surprisingly, Herbalife disagrees. The company says it has millions of customers around the world. The CEO went on CNBC and accused Ackman of 'market manipulation' â€” a typical accusation CEOs hurl against shorts. </p>
<p>"So, who's right here? How hard can it be to tell whether a giant company is a pyramid scheme? In this case, weirdly, it's really hard. </p>
<p>"For a company like Herbalife, the difference between being a legitimate business and being a pyramid scheme comes down to what happens on the ground with all those people who signed up to sell products. </p>
<p>"If it's a legitimate business, they're mostly selling the products to people who actually want to use them."<br/></p>
