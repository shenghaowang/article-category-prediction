<p>NEW YORK—American Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. are ending an agreement that allowed travellers to add connections to their itinerary on each other’s aircraft.</p>
<p>The termination of the interline sales agreement is effective Monday.</p>
<p>The companies also said that they are ending a reciprocal frequent-flyer program accrual agreement. Travellers won’t earn miles or points when travelling on eligible routes run by the other airline beginning April 1.</p>
<p>All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through the partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and are not affected.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2014/02/26/delta_to_make_radical_change_to_frequentflier_program.html" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this, false)" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this, false)">Delta announced fundamental changes</a> to its frequent-flier program. Starting next year, Delta customers will earn miles based on how much they spend, not just how far they fly.</p>
<p>American Airlines Group Inc. is the holding company for American Airlines and US Airways.</p>
