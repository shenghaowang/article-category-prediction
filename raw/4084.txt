<p>I was kicking the idea with my brother to open up a hookah bar /
smoke lounge to hopefully get a jump on legalization, which should
be soon for New Hampshire (the Live Free or Die state, but not so
much). He still needs convincing. Good to see these numbers from
Colorado. I think it makes sense for NH since the only that is
taxed (beside the ridiculous property taxes) is alcohol, tobacco
and prepared food.</p>

<p>Wouldn't want to scare people off by having them think that
smoke lounges are going to start popping up all over the place.
Would you?</p>
<p>Sorry to break the news to you and your buddy, but we are only
advocating for the legal, personal use of marijuana by adults
within the privacy of our own homes.</p>
<p>That's fair enough.</p>
<p>Public marijuana use is still not legal.</p>
<p>Nobody is advocating for that either at the moment.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no doubt now that the majority of Americans
want to completely legalize marijuana nationwide. Our numbers grow
on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The prohibitionist view on marijuana is the viewpoint of a
minority of Americans.. It is based upon decades of lies and
propaganda.</p>
<p>Each and every tired old lie they have propagated has been
thoroughly proven false by both science and society.</p>
<p>Their tired old rhetoric no longer holds any validity. The
majority of Americans have seen through the sham of marijuana
prohibition in this day and age. The number of prohibitionists left
shrinks on a daily basis.</p>
<p>With their credibility shattered, and their not so hidden
agendas visible to a much wiser public, what's left for a marijuana
prohibitionist to do?</p>
<p>Maybe, just come to terms with the fact that Marijuana
Legalization Nationwide is an inevitable reality that's approaching
much sooner than prohibitionists think, and there is nothing they
can do to stop it!</p>
<p>Legalize Nationwide!...and Support All Marijuana Legalization
Efforts!</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by fake "Decriminalization" because under it,
citizens are still treated like common criminals over marijuana.
Why else do you think they are so EAGER to take this route instead
of full legalization?</p>
<p>Citizens will still be forced to the dangerous illegal black
market and a shady, illegal drug dealer to purchase marijuana.
Getting caught purchasing that marijuana IS still a crime they will
arrest you for. Then, besides the fines, they will FORCE you to
mandatory rehab, and if you don't go? Guess what? Jailtime!</p>
<p>Also, we will still be wasting our tax dollars sending law
enforcement's manpower chasing around marijuana users to ticket,
rather than allowing them the time, manpower, and resources to
protect us from real, dangerous criminals who commit crimes with
actual victims.</p>
<p>Don't be fooled!</p>
