<p>King Digital Entertainment has put a price range on the shares to be floated in its upcoming initial public offering. In a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1580732/000119312514094529/d564433df1a.htm#toc564433_1" target="_blank">filing</a> submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission today the company, maker of the wildly popular title <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> and other games for mobile devices, said it aims to raise up to $533 million in its flotation. 22.2 million shares of the Ireland-based firm will be sold at a range of of $21 to $24 apiece. </p>
<p>The firm plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KING. No date has yet been set for the IPO.</p>
<p>The lead underwriters of the company's flotation are <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> <span class="ticker" data-id="204149">(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/jpmorgan-chase/jpm">NYSE:JPM</a>)</span> unit J.P. Morgan, <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> <span class="ticker" data-id="209627">(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/credit-suisse-group/cs">NYSE:CS</a>)</span>, and <strong>Bank of America</strong> Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> in particular, King's IPO is certain to attract investor interest. The market might be wary of such companies going public, however; since its December 2011 IPO <strong>Zynga</strong>'s <span class="ticker" data-id="270875">(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/zynga/znga">NASDAQ:ZNGA</a>)</span> share price has dropped from $10 to just under $5.80 at its most recent close. </p>
