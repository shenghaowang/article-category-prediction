<p>Market-watchers stunned as valuation makes it bigger than Severn Trent or Tate&amp;Lyle</p>
<p>The UK games developer behind the hit app Candy Crush Saga has stunned market-watchers by announcing it will be valued at up to $7.56bn (£4.55bn) when it lists on the New York Stock Exchange later this year – almost $2bn more than expected.</p>
<p>King, which has a major office near Tottenham Court Road in London but is domiciled in Dublin, yesterday announced a price of between $21 and $24 per share for its initial public offering, valuing it at $6.6bn to $7.56bn, much more than the $5bn initially estimated.</p>
<p>If King reaches the top end of its valuation the company will be worth more than FTSE 100 stalwarts such as the water utility Severn Trent, sugar giant Tate &amp; Lyle and car insurer Admiral. King made a profit of $568m last year on revenue of $1.88bn, but its stock market filings admitted that 78 per cent of this came from its game Candy Crush Saga.</p>
<p>Commentators in the US press have expressed doubts over the longevity of the business given its reliance on the one game, with <em>The Atlantic Magazine</em> calling the company a "horrible investment". This week's <em>New Yorker</em> also called King "part of a venerable tradition: the one-hit wonder" and drew parallels to the disastrous float of the Facebook gaming firm Zynga in 2011.</p>
<p>Zynga was valued at $7bn on its debut, then the biggest tech float since Google's, but saw its value collapse as games such as Farmville declined in popularity. The company is currently worth $4.7bn.</p>
<p>Tech investors last night defended King's valuation, denying it would be a repeat of Zynga. One London-based venture capitalist said the company was not a "flash in the pan", pointing out: "It's more than a decade old and had been cash-flow positive since 2005."</p>
<p>The spreadbetting firm ETX Capital has been running a grey market for King, which ahead of yesterday's pricing announcement valued the company at between $6.82bn and $9.32bn.</p>
<p>Another London-based investor suggested that "with the resources as a public company King could be a long-term winner". The company is hoping to raise $533m from its stock market listing.</p>
<p>King was founded in 2003 by Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, son of the former Lonrho chief executive and <em>Observer</em> newspaper owner Roland "Tiny" Rowland. The company originally developed small-stakes gambling games for sites such as Yahoo and MSN, before launching games on Facebook and mobile.</p>
<p>The smartphone version of its hit Candy Crush Saga, launched in 2012, has been downloaded more than half a billion times.</p>
<p>Eleven executives and directors at King will be worth a combined $2.2bn if it achieves the top end of its valuation. Mr Zaccconi, the chief executive, stands to make up to $745m, while the chairman, Mel Morris, a former Derby County football club director, will make more than $870m.</p>
<p>The London venture capital firm Apax Partners' stake could be valued at up to $3.4bn while the investor Index Ventures will see its holding valued at as much as $599m.</p>
