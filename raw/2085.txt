<p>Investing.com - Gold prices fell on Friday after data revealed
the U.S. economy picked up more jobs than expected in February,

dismantling monetary stimulus tools that have bolstered

since 2012.</p>
<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery traded at $1,338.80 a troy ounce during
U.S. trading, down 0.96%, up from a session low of $1,329.00 and
off a high of $1,353.10.</p>
<p>The April contract settled up 0.86% at $1,351.80 on
Thursday.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Futures were likely to find support at $1,320.10 a troy ounce,
the low from Feb. 28, and resistance at $1,355.00, Monday's
high.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier that the U.S.
economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a
149,000 increase.</p>
<p>January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.</p>
<p>The U.S. private sector added 162,000 jobs last month, exceeding
expectations for a 154,000 rise. January's figure was revised up to
145,000 from 142,000.</p>
<p>The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate ticked up
to 6.7% in February, from 6.6% the previous month. Analysts had
expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged last month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, data also showed that the U.S. trade deficit expanded
to $39.1 billion in January, from $38.98 billion in December, whose
figure was revised from a previously estimated deficit of $38.7
billion.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the trade deficit to expand to $39.00

<p>The data sent the dollar gaining, as the Federal Reserve has

<p>Fed bond purchases, currently set at $65 billion a month, weaken
the dollar by suppressing interest rates that aim to spur recovery
by encouraging investing and hiring, which makes gold an attractive

<p>Still, dollar didn't soar and gold didn't plummet as the market
has already priced in expectations for the Fed to continue winding
down stimulus measures as the year unfolds.</p>

troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were down 4.27%
at US$3.081 a pound.</p>
