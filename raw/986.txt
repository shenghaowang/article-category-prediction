<p>If you have a reverse mortgage, let your heirs know. Soon after
you die, your lender must be repaid. Heirs will need to quickly
settle on a course of action.</p>
<p>If one spouse has died but the surviving spouse is listed as a
borrower on the reverse mortgage, he or she can continue to live in
the home, and the terms of the loan do not change. At the death of
the last borrower, though, adult children and other nonspouse heirs
must pay off the loan. They can keep the property, sell the
property or turn the keys over to the lender--and their decision is
"usually driven by whether there's equity left in the property,"
says Joseph DeMarkey, a principal member of Reverse Mortgage
Funding.</p>
<p>A reverse mortgage allows seniors age 62 or older to tap their
home equity. Nearly all reverse mortgages are federally backed Home
Equity Conversion Mortgages. The homeowner doesn't make payments on
the loan while living in the house, but the loan becomes due at the
death of the last borrower.</p>
<p>Heirs get an initial six months to deal with the loan payoff.
And it's to their advantage to move as quickly as possible. Until
the loan is settled, interest on the balance and monthly insurance
premiums will continue to eat into any remaining equity.</p>
<p>The good news for heirs is that reverse mortgages are
"nonrecourse" loans. That means if the loan amount exceeds the
home's value, the lender cannot go after the rest of the estate or
the heirs' other assets for payment. "The estate can never owe more
than the value of the property," says Gregg Smith, president and
chief operating officer of One Reverse Mortgage.</p>
<p>The difference is covered by federal mortgage insurance, which
the borrower pays while holding a HECM. If there is leftover equity
after the loan is paid off, that money goes to the estate.</p>
<p>When the last owner dies, the estate's executor should contact
the lender. (Lenders keep track of databases that note deaths and
will send a notice to heirs if records indicate the last borrower
has died.) Loan proceeds disbursed as monthly payments will stop.
If the borrower took a line of credit, that line will be
closed.</p>
<p>Within 30 days of notification, the lender will send a federally
approved appraiser to determine the home's market value. The amount
that's due to the lender is the lesser of the reverse mortgage loan
balance or 95% of the appraised market value of the home.</p>
<p>Say the appraiser determines the home is worth $200,000 and the
loan balance is $100,000. To keep the house, the heirs need to pay
the loan balance of $100,000. If the house is sold, the heirs get
any equity above the $100,000 loan balance.</p>
<p>But say the home declined in value during the housing slump and
the loan now exceeds the home's appraised value--the home is
appraised for $100,000, but the loan balance is $200,000. To keep
the home, the heirs will need to pay $95,000--95% of the $100,000
market value. The heir doesn't have to pay the full balance; the
government insurance covers the remaining loan amount.</p>
<p>If the heirs decide to sell this house, the home must be listed
at a minimum of the appraised value. (The 5% difference helps cover
the costs of selling.) Because all sale proceeds go to pay off part
of the loan and real estate fees, the estate receives no equity.
The government insurance picks up the difference on the loan.</p>
<p>But if there is no potential equity, heirs may decide to simply
hand the keys to the lender and avoid the hassle of trying to sell
the home. Known as "deed in lieu of foreclosure," the heirs sign
the deed over to the lender. "If the property was underwater, the
heirs may have no interest in selling it or keeping it," says Diane
Coats, senior operational oversight specialist for Generation
Mortgage.</p>
<p>Heirs can request up to two 90-day extensions. To get that full
year, they must show evidence that they are arranging the financing
to keep the house, or they are actively trying to sell the house,
such as providing a listing document or sales contract.</p>
