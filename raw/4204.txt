  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn">AMZN</a>

  ) has announced an increase in its prime membership annual fee to
  $99 from $79, representing a 25% hike.</p>
<p>Amazon's Prime service that provides two-day free shipping was
  priced at $79 since its launch in 2005. Recently, Amazon beefed
  up the service with the addition of online video streaming and
  the kindle library. Amazon's kindle library includes above
  500,000 Kindle titles and more than 40,000 movies and TV episodes
  for streaming via Prime Instant online video.</p>
<p>The move comes as Amazon is facing intense bottom-line
  pressure. The increase in shipping costs and fuel price hike
  forced the company to raise the price. In the last reported
  quarter, the company's net shipping expenses surged 19% to $1.21
  billion. The price hike could negatively impact subscriber growth
  amid significant competition from
  <strong>Netflix</strong>

  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nflx">NFLX</a>

  ).</p>
<p>The prime service has been expanding considerably over the
  years, with new Prime membership signups exceeding more than the
  company's expectations during peak periods in December. Seeing
  the strong demand for the service, Amazon could increase the
  prices without affecting growth to a great extent. Though the
  number of prime subscribers has not been revealed, analysts
  expect the online retail giant has 20 to 25 million prime members
  in the U.S.</p>
<p>This strategic move could help Amazon to improve its top line
  and margin profile while still generating healthy growth in the
  future. Additionally, the company's partnerships with major film
  studios and production houses have helped it to expand its
  content portfolio faster than its rivals.</p>
<p>Also, Amazon is rumored to be launching a television set-top
  box (STB) which will stream video content. The STB will not only
  compete directly with
  <strong>Apple Inc.</strong>

  's (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl">AAPL</a>

  ) Apple TV but also with similar products from Roku Inc. and
  Boxee Inc., as well as gaming consoles from
  <strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong>

  (
  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/msft">MSFT</a>

  ) and Sony Corp. that offer video programming.</p>
<p>We believe the company's ever expanding content portfolio will
  continue to attract subscribers despite the price rise.</p>
<p>However, significant competition from eBay, Google and other
  online retailers remain a matter of concern. Additionally,
  Amazon's continuing investments in fulfillment centers could hurt
  profitability, going forward.</p>
<p>Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p>
