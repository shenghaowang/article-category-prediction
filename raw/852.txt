<p>Chiquita has combined with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company.</p>
<p>The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion  US in annual sales. The merged <span>company, </span>ChiquitaFyffes<span></span>PLC, will<span> be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.</span></p>
<p>The companies said the deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.</p>
<p>Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of the combined operation.</p>
<p>The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.</p>
<p>Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66 US).</p>
<p>Fyffes rose 46 per cent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 per cent to $12.20 in New York.</p>
<p>Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.</p>
<p>Fyffes chairman David McCann will become chief executive officer of the combined company while the chief executive of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.</p>
<p>Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."</p>
<p>However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita, which has a big presence in the or Fyffes, a major presence in Europe, aren't expected to notice any difference. The two brands are staying separate.</p>
