<p>Liam Friel attended this years Boy Scouts of America Merit Badge Fair held at Lourdes High School Saturday March 15, 2014. Liam is from Maryland and has earned 127 Merit Badges and was in Rochester Saturday to earn his Mining in Society badge.</p>
<p>After earning his first 20 or so Boy Scout merit badges, a light bulb went on in Liam Friel's head.</p>
<p>"I thought, 'This is fun; I should go for all of them,'" he said.</p>
<p>So he did. Two years and about 120 merit badges later, Friel found himself in Rochester on Saturday for the <a href="http://www.gamehavenbsa.org/">Gamehaven Council</a> merit badge fair at Lourdes High School, trying to earn two more merit badges.</p>
<p>"If I get these two today, I'll only have six to go," Friel said. One of the badges he was after Saturday was the new Mining in Society badge, which was just made officially available on Feb. 24. The Gamehaven Council fair was one of the first to offer a class for the new badge, and Friel quickly sent in his reservation.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that only about 200 Scouts have ever earned every single merit badge, what's remarkable is that Friel and his dad, Tim Friel, flew into Rochester late Friday night from their home in Maryland, and flew back to Maryland on Saturday afternoon. It's not the farthest Friel has traveled to earn a merit badge. He once made a trip to San Diego to earn a merit badge.</p>
<p>"We've been to Texas, Wyoming, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware," said his dad said. "People say, 'You're pushing him.' No, he's pushing me."</p>
<p>The elder Friel said he was surprised when his son decided to try to get every single merit badge. "There was no indication," he said. "All of a sudden it was, 'I want them all.'"</p>
<p>Liam, 14, said he keeps close tabs on the list of where classes in particular merit badges are being offered. Then he starts planning his travels. He was surprised, when he arrived Saturday morning at Lourdes, to find nearly 800 Scouts, plus leaders and instructors, in attendance.</p>
<p>"I didn't realize how great of a program this was until I got here," he said.</p>
<p>Friel's first merit badge, back in 2010, was one you can't get anymore: the historic badge based on former Boy Scout badges, which was only available that year for the 100th anniversary of Scouting.</p>
<p>Since then, he's moved steadily through nearly every badge offered. "Each one of them exposes you to such a wide variety of occupations and hobbies," he said. "You learn a little about a lot."</p>
<p>At Saturday's opening ceremony, Friel was invited to say a few words to the Scouts in attendance.</p>
<p>"Anything you set your mind to, you can do," he told the audience. "But first, you have to set a goal."</p>
<p>Good advice from someone who, after Saturday, is only six badges away from his goal.</p>
