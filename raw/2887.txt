<p>The maker of the popular game âCandy Crush Sagaâ has picked $7.6 billion out of the thin air for its initial public offering. King Digital Entertainment uses creative metrics to justify its whopping valuation. But thereâs no way to calculate what an enterprise is worth when its profit can skyrocket 70-fold one year and could collapse the next. Rival Zyngaâs IPO flub serves as an apposite warning.</p>
<p>Kingâs performance in 2013 was certainly impressive. Revenue climbed more than 11-fold, which means the company enjoyed astounding operating leverage. Moreover, the firm throws off boatloads of cash – $580 million from operations last year. Its backers have only had to put in $9 million of capital to date. No wonder they now fancy taking the company public.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the methods theyâre using to value the company arenât particularly helpful. Metrics like monthly gross average bookings per paying user (MGABPPU) and gross average booking per user (GABPU) shed little if any light for prospective investors.</p>
<p>Social gaming as a business is driven by hit products. Zyngaâs travails show how hard it is to stay on top. Its shares have lost about half their value since their opening-day high in 2011 as the popularity of games like âFarmVilleâ faded. Heavy spending to buy rivals hasnât worked either. Zynga spent $200 million on OMGPop and closed the business about a year later.</p>
<p>Sure, King looks cheaper â at the top of the range it would be worth about four times last yearâs revenue, compared with five times for Zynga. But such comparisons may not be solid. âCandy Crush Sagaâ generated close to 80 percent of Kingâs bookings in the fourth quarter. There are already signs its peak may have passed. Instead of its customary explosive growth, fourth-quarter revenue was 3 percent lower than the third quarter. King needs a new hit, if not several, soon.</p>
<p>The company makes much of its âunique, repeatable, scalableâ system of developing and distributing new games. Thereâs some truth to that â the company has been cash flow positive for nine years. So it can probably trundle along for a while even if it canât develop a new hit when its current one fades. Thatâs hardly a basis for such a lofty IPO valuation.</p>
