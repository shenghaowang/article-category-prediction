<p>Premier Li Keqiang was positive about the Chinese economy's growth potential this year and confident with the government's ability to deal with challenges ahead.</p>
<p>In the press conference this morning presided over by Li during the on-going annual conference of the National People's Congress, one third of the media's questions were about the economy and financial sector and reform.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter asked what were the biggest challenges to realize the 7.7 percent economic growth last year and what are the pressing issues for Li to solve now?</p>
<p>"The downward pressure for Chinese economic growth is the largest challenge last year," Li said.</p>
<p>The central government's revenue even registered a negative growth. There are money shortages in the financial sector, and the interbank lending rate exceeded 13 percent. There is also a slump in electricity consumption and cargo transportation volume.</p>
<p>There are views saying the Chinese economy will suffer a hard-landing and the slide may be 3 to 4 percent.</p>
<p>"We have very limited space to carry out fiscal and monetary policies. The macro-control confronts multiple difficulties," Li noted.</p>
<p>"It takes wisdom to solve difficulties. We keep old, effective ways and innovate new solutions and thoughts. We make it clear what is the reasonable range for economic operation."</p>
<p>He pointed out that growth and employment should not dip below the lower limit. Inflation should not exceed the upper limit.</p>
<p>"We should try to deepen reform, adjust the structure and play up the market's role. We shoulder the pressure and realized the main targets of economic growth," he said.</p>
<p>"We should first grind the ax before cutting firewood. We squarely face the difficulties and challenges, draw on advantages and avoid disadvantages. This is how we overcome difficulties," Li added.</p>
<p>"The Chinese economy has huge potential and flexibility. We have the ability and conditions to keep this year's economic operation within the reasonable range."</p>
