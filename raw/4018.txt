<p>KARACHI: It was a tragic end to what was easily a very valuable innings for Pakistan.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Sami Aslam was on his way to becoming the youngest opener to hit a century in England when a suicidal call resulted in his run-out on the sedonc day of the third Test against England. But by then, the left-hander had cemented his place for the fourth and final Test at The Oval by hitting a resolute 82. Sami faced 176 balls, hitting nine fours and a six in his valiant knock.</p>
<p>It was a highly important innings for Pakistan considering that Sami’s senior partner – Mohammad Hafiz – had departed for 0 after playing a rash shot off Jimmy Anderson in the very first over. Together with Azhar Ali, Sami put on a valuable partnership of 181 in 61.4 overs. Their second-wicket stand could well turn out to be a match-winning one for Pakistan, who are looking to bounce back after getting thrashed in the second Test at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>The Lahore-born Sami only made it to the playing eleven for the Edgbaston Test because of the fact that Pakistan’s first-choice opener Shan Masood had proved himself to be unreliable especially when facing Anderson.</p>
<p>Before Edgbaston, Sami had played two previous Tests, against Bangladesh last year, but made just 47 runs in three innings. In 30 first-class matches he has scored more hundreds (six) than he has half-centuries (four) which suggests he has the hunger to convert into big scores (three of his centuries are over 150) although his first-class average is a modest 35.47 at the moment. He was prolific at Under-19 level and is currently the second-highest run-scorer in U-19 ODI history with 1695 runs. He was captain of the Pakistan U-19 side when they toured England in 2013 and made two centuries in a tri-series, including 110 in the final against England, before catching the eye with another hundred in victory over India at the U-19 Asia Cup.</p>
