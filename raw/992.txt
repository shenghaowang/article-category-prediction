<p>Men's Wearhouse will become
 the fourth-biggest U.S. men's clothing retailer.<br/></p>
<p><a href="http://www.menswearhouse.com/">Men's Wearhouse</a> and <a href="http://www.josbank.com/">Jos. A. Bank Clothiers </a>announced that they have
 entered into an agreement under which Men's Wearhouse will 
acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Jos. A. Bank 
for $65 per share in cash or total consideration of $1.8 billion. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://thewire.pennlive.com/PAHAP/471839006c4941e995d914b040ff41c7/Article_2014-03-11-Men%27s%20Wearhouse-Jos%20A%20Bank/id-f44e7db3cad84737a589331345f44bd9">Associated Press</a> reported that the agreement ends negotiations 
that began in October when Jos. A. Bank offered to buy Men's Wearhouse 
for $2.3 billion. Men's Wearhouse turned down the offer offering to buy 
Jos. A. Bank for $1.54 billion. By early March Men's Wearhouse had an 
offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to 
$65 per share if some conditions were met. With the sale of Jos. A. Bank Clothiers to The Men's Wearhouse, the new 
company will have more than 1,700 stores and 23,000 employees.</p>
<p>Men's Warehouse has stores locally at the Paxton Towne Center in Lower Paxton Twp. and at the Capital City Mall in Lower Allen Twp. Jos. A. Bank has stores locally in Camp Hill and at the Shoppes at Susquehanna Marketplace in Susquehanna Twp.<br/></p>
