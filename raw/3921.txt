<p>Chinese e-commerce giant <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba">Alibaba</a> Group plans to go public on a U.S. stock exchange, possibly raising up to $15 billion in the biggest initial public offering since Facebook.</p>
<p>The announcement on Sunday confirming plans for a US share sale ended months of speculation over where the company would list after talks for an initial public offering in Hong Kong fell apart last year.</p>
<p>Alibaba is one of the world’s biggest internet companies and says more than $150bn worth of merchandise changes hands on its online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay combined.</p>
<p>The company began as a service to link Chinese suppliers with retailers abroad and has branched out into retail e-commerce. It is little known abroad but has launched two consumer-oriented services in the United States.</p>
<p>“Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,” the company said in a statement. “This will make us a more global company and enhance the company’s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.”</p>
<p>It gave no details of the timing or size of the initial public offering or on which exchange it would take place.</p>
<p>Analysts have estimated that an Alibaba IPO could raise up to $15bn and value the company at more than $100bn. Facebook’s IPO in June last year raised $16bn and at the time valued the company at more than $100bn.</p>
<p>Alibaba is one of a number of Chinese internet heavyweights planning to cash in with IPOs amid rapid growth. The announcement comes two days after Chinese internet company Sina’s Weibo microblog unit filed plans for a possible share sale in the US. </p>
<p>Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, indicates it plans to raise $500m. Another Chinese online retailing giant, JD.com, filed in January for a U.S. stock listing.</p>
