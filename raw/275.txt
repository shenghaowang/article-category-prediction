<p class="text-abstract__content">Losses on Asian markets came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the United States.</p>
<p>Asian markets tumbled following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.</p>
<p>The losses came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the United States, while investors are keeping an eye on events in Ukraine as leaders try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p>
<p>Tokyo slipped 1.01 per cent, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93 per cent, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03 per cent lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.</p>
<p>Shanghai dived 2.86 per cent, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75 per cent, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.</p>
<p>Beijing said on Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98 billion in February.</p>
<p>The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8 billion in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $US11.9 billion surplus. Exports fell 18.1 per cent and imports jumped 10.1 per cent.</p>
<p>"It's hard to ignore a number that looks like that," said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.</p>
<p>Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2.0 per cent in February, down from 2.5 per cent in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.</p>
<p>While authorities blame the country's holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness.</p>
<p>The sell-off on Monday is "symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers", he told Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p>In Japan the government said Monday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2 per cent in the quarter to December and 1.5 per cent through 2013, slower than first thought.</p>
<p>Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3 per cent in October-December period and 1.6 per cent over the year.</p>
<p>While the data still marked Japan's best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.</p>
<p>In currency trade the yen rose after seeing a sell-off for most of last week. In the afternoon the dollar fell to 103.15 yen from 103.24 yen in New York Friday.</p>
<p>The euro fetched $1.3886 and 143.23 yen, against $1.3874 and 143.31 yen.</p>
<p>The United States provided a broadly positive lead after official figures showed 175,000 jobs were created in February, rebounding from two disappointing winter-battered months, suggesting economic growth is still on track.</p>
<p>On Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.05 per cent to its third record in four days and the Dow gained 0.19 per cent but the Nasdaq fell 0.37 per cent.</p>
<p>In Kuala Lumpur flag-carrier Malaysia Airlines lost 20 per cent at one point after one of its 777 airliners went missing at the weekend with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. However, it clawed back a substantial part of that to sit four per cent lower in late trade.</p>
<p>The broader market was down 0.50 per cent.</p>
<p>Oil prices fell. New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, was down 13 cents at $US102.45 and Brent North Sea crude for April fell 82 cents to $US108.18.</p>
<p>Gold fetched $US1,339.80 an ounce at 1200 GMT (2300 AEDT) compared with $US1,348.20 late Friday.</p>
