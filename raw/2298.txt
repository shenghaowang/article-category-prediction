<p>DENVER -- Denver-based Quiznos has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reduce its debt by more than $400 million after the chain lost ground to competitors.</p>
<p>The toasted sandwich company said Friday that it voluntarily filed to reorganize to implement a pre-packaged restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Quiznos says the move won't affect its customers.</p>
<p>The company only owns and operates seven of the nearly 2,100 Quiznos restaurants. The rest are owned and operated by franchisees and aren't part of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Quiznos, founded in 1981, says the restructuring plan has been approved by its creditors so it expects to emerge from reorganization quickly.</p>
