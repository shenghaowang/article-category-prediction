<p>An anonymous billionaire in Silicon Valley recently purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy worth $201million.  The policy was sold by Santa Barbara based company S.G., an advising firm that specializes in complex financial situations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101495273"> cnbc</a> SG's president and founder, Dovi Frances has confirmed that the policy is split between 19 different companies.  The amount was too high that no single company could afford a hit that big.</p>
<p>The deal took seven months to construct  and surpasses the previous largest life insurance policy worth $100 million taken out by David Geffen in 1990. According to the<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/2014/03/15/silicon-valley-billionaire-buys-record-life-policy/Dd9RtwlimYbbgbpirjCJYN/story.html"> AssociatedPress</a> the Guinness Book of World Records announced Thursday that the $201 million policy holds the new world record after three months of reviewing.  </p>
<p>The billionaire chose to remain anonymous for privacy reasons and not even his age has been disclosed.  However Frances did disclose one reason the billionaire gave for taking out such a large policy.  He bought it to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax when he dies.</p>
