<p>So today, American Airlines (<a href="http://www.aa.com" target="_blank">www.aa.com</a>) announced in a press release that it will terminate its interline traffic agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program with <strong>JetBlue Airways </strong>(<a href="http://www.jetblue.com)" target="_blank">www.jetblue.com)</a>.</p>
<p>That agreement covered select routes from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).</p>
<p>Beginning today, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier, the American press release said.</p>
<p>In addition, effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline.</p>
<p>All American <strong>AAdvantage</strong> miles or JetBlue <strong>TrueBlue</strong> points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers' accounts and are not affected, said American.</p>
<p>American also said the two airlines are working together to ensure these changes have little impact to customers.</p>
