<p>Patrick Drahi, the controlling shareholder of French cable operator Numericable Group, has said he will not be increasing his bid for Vivendi’s SFR.</p>
<p>In an interview with French daily <em>Les Echos</em>, Drahi said he had no reason to raise his offer. “I have worked seven years on this,” he commented. “I have no reason to modify it.”</p>

<p>Drahi’s comment comes as Altice, the Luxembourg holding group that controls Numericable, finds itself in a bidding war with French conglomerate Bouygues to buy SFR.</p>
<p>Altice has confirmed it had made a firm offer to Vivendi which includes €10.9 billion in cash and would grant a 32 per cent stake to Vivendi in the newly merged Numericable-SFR unit.</p>
<p>Bouygues on the other hand offered €10.5 billion in cash and a 46 per cent stake in a newly merged Bouygues Telecom-SFR group.</p>
<p>Drahi reiterated that his offer stands until Friday (March 14th). He said a merged Numericable-SFR would be based and listed and pay taxes in France, in a bid to reassure French officials. He also said he would be the president of a merged group if his offer is picked.</p>
