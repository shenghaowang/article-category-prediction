<p>
	LONDON -- The Bank of England has appointed an International Monetary Fund official to a new job overseeing markets and banking -- a position created amid allegations that bank officials condoned fixing in currency markets.</p>
<p>
	Nemat "Minouche" Shafik, the IMF's deputy managing director, will be one of two deputy governors and join the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. Her appointment Tuesday helps correct a gender gap at the bank. When she takes up her post at the start of August, she will be the only woman on the nine-member MPC.</p>
<p>
	While at the IMF, Shafik oversaw much of its work in Europe during the past few crisis-fueled years.</p>
<p>
	Bank Gov. Mark Carney has pledged a "root and branch" review into how the bank monitors markets following the fixing allegations.</p>
