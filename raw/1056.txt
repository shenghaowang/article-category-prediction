  Colorado collected $1.4 million from a 10 percent sales tax on
  marijuana, as well as $416,690 from the state’s normal 2.9
  percent sales tax, the Colorado Department of Revenue reported
  Monday.
</p>
<p>
  Another $195,318 came in through an excise tax, which goes
  towards school construction in the state.
</p>
<p>
  All in all, the month’s figures point to over $14 million in
  total retail marijuana sales for January.
</p>
<p>
  The January figures, though, still fell below state predictions.
  Estimates from government sources for the first six months of
  2014 fell above $190 million. Should January’s sales pace
  continue, that six-month period would yield $84 million.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed January tax
  returns, according to the revenue department, with 24 being
  approved at the beginning of the month.
</p>
<p>
  Yet as time passes, there will be room for growth. By the end of
  February, the state had approved 167 recreational marijuana
  businesses, though not all of them have received the local
  approval that is also needed for a shop to open.
</p>
<p>
  Colorado lawmakers are still <a href="http://rt.com/usa/colorado-tax-pot-exceeds-expectations-985/" target="_blank">deliberating</a> on how the recreational
  marijuana taxes will be used. Gov. John Hickenlooper has
  advocated using the money specifically for drug addiction
  treatment and youth prevention programs, while the Legislature
  has held out on making any decisions until more information about
  marijuana tax revenue is available.
