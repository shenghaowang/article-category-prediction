<p>KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA – It’s been five days since Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared into thin air, and the mystery is deepening every day.</p>
<p>Officials are expanding their search yet again, with 12 countries now scouring 27,000 square miles of land and water in southeast Asia.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Now it seems the expansive search may be paying off — a Chinese satellite looking into the disappearance “has observed a suspected crash area at sea,” a </span>Chinese<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> agency said.</span></p>
<p>While those possible findings develop, Colorado-based company DigitalGlobe is enlisting the public`s help by pointing satellites at the search area and posting the images online.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Additionally, an oil rig worker claims he may have seen the plane go down off the coast of </span>Vietnam<span style="line-height:1.5em;">. </span></p>
<p>He said in a letter to his employer that he saw something “burning at high altitude” around the time the plane disappeared.</p>
<p>Vietnamese authorities sent an aircraft to investigate, but no word on any findings yet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, family members desperate for news of their loved ones are growing increasingly upset.</p>
<p>“My son, you need to find him, you need to search quicker,” one distraught father shouted at authorities.</p>
<p>Officials say they are doing all they can, but that is small comfort to family members desperately trying to cling to hope.</p>
