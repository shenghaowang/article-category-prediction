<p class="News-body-text"> SAN FRANCISCO — A Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world's most valuable life insurance policy.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> A financial adviser said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to cobble together a deal that surpasses a $100 million policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> “No one company can afford to take a $201 million hit,” said the adviser, Dovi Frances, who represents a “well-known billionaire.”  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> Frances said the billionaire wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> “He wants his next of kin to keep working hard,” Frances said.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> Frances said the billionaire purchased the insurance to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax upon his death. Frances said, generally speaking, that many super-wealthy people are taking out big loans because interest rates are low. Those loans are to be paid in full immediately upon death, further cutting into a billionaire's cash holdings.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> “Most billionaires have their value tied up in hard assets and maybe don't have so much cash immediately available for such a big hit,” Frances said. </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen's record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> “It was worse than any audit you can think of,” he said.  </p>
<p class="News-body-text"> Several billionaires have connections to Frances' firm, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt. </p>
