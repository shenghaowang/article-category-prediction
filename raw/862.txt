<p class="description">COLORADO made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday.</p>
<p>The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.</p>
<p>Colorado legalised pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn&amp;apost begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming months.</p>

<p>The pot taxes come from 12.9 per cent sales taxes and 15 per cent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.</p>
<p>Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if they wish.</p>

<p>Monday&amp;aposs tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about how to spend the windfall.</p>
<p>Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall.</p>
<p>Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more advertising discouraging driving while high.</p>

<p>State police chiefs have asked for more money, too.</p>
<p>“The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,” said Sen. Pat Steadman, who serves on Colorado&amp;aposs budget-writing Joint Budget Committee.</p>
<p>Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world&amp;aposs first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay&amp;aposs marijuana program is still under development.</p>
