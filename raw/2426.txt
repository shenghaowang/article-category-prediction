<p>Investing.com - Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor
Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market
economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for delivery in April traded at $101.21 a barrel during U.S.
trading, down 1.34%. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low
of $100.86 a barrel and a high of $102.73 a barrel.</p>
<p>The April contract settled up 1.00% at $102.58 a barrel on
Friday.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.17 a
barrel, Thursday's low, and resistance at $102.89 a barrel,
Friday's high.</p>
<p>Weak Chinese trade data bruised 
<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil.aspx">oil
prices</a>

on Monday.</p>
<p>Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports
fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8%
increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.</p>
<p>A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.</p>
<p>The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are
cooling.</p>
<p>China is the world's second-largest consumer of crude oil.</p>
<p>Cushioning losses, however, were ongoing geopolitical tensions
in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if
escalated.</p>
<p>Friday's better-than-expected U.S. jobs report offset losses as
well by boosting hopes demand will pick up in the world's largest
consumer of oil.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S.
economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a
149,000 increase.</p>
<p>January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil
futures for April delivery were down 0.90% and trading at US$107.49
a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude
contracts stood at US$6.28 a barrel.</p>
