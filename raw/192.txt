<p>The People's Bank of China has announced that starting March 17, the exchange rate for the yuan will be permitted to fluctuate by 2 percent from a daily midpoint rate that is set each morning by the central bank.<br/><br/>The central bank issued a statement via its website on Saturday that "it will continue to improve the yuan exchange rate system, increase the two-way flexibility of the exchange rate, make the currency more responsive to market forces and keep the exchange rate fundamentally stable within reasonable and balanced levels".<br/><br/>China takes a gradual and steady pace in raising its currency's daily trading limit, from 0.3 percent in 1994 to 0.5 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2012 to the latest 2 percent.<br/><br/>A spokesperson from the bank said the decision is aimed at improving the efficiency of the market in allocating resources, and forms a major part of the country's efforts to optimize its economic development system. <br/><br/>The spokesperson also partially attributed the move to the strengthened risk management capabilities of the country's traders and the rise in trade volume and category in China's foreign exchange market in recent years.<br/><br/>The spokesperson pointed out that the widening trade band is neither related to the yuan's appreciation nor its devaluation, saying two-way flexibility is normal for major international currencies in the middle and long term.<br/><br/>However, he indicated that the central bank may consider "necessary" adjustments or regulatory measures in the event of abnormal fluctuations of the yuan.Â </p>
