<p>Global Times reported that the most traded copper contract for delivery in May declined by 0.45% on the Shanghai Futures Exchange Friday compared to Thursday, ending at CNY 48,920 per tonne. It also decreased by 0.73% WoW. The trading volume expanded by 2,154 lots to 134,000 lots Friday.<br/><br/>Friday's fall in copper on the SHFE came as cautious investors awaited news of the US employment situation, amid low expectations for Friday's US payrolls data.<br/><br/>Mr Li Keqiang Chinese Premier said that the country's economic growth target for 2014 would be around 7.5%. This target will probably involve some easing of the reform agenda, which is likely supportive for bulks as the pressure to reduce steel capacity may temporarily ease.<br/><br/>The news also propped up investor sentiment slightly in the global copper market. Investors hope China can maintain its robust demand for commodities in general and for metals in particular, as it would support prices this year.<br/><br/>China is the world's largest consumer of base metals, and accounts for nearly 40% of global copper demand. China's imports of major commodities were quite strong in February, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs Saturday. But the price of industrial commodities such as copper still fell in February.<br/><br/>Source - Global Times<br/><br/>&lt;a href="http://www.metalguru.in /"&gt;(www.metalguru.in)&lt;/a&gt;</p>
