<p class="story-body__introduction">Men's Wearhouse has agreed to buy Jos A Bank, ending a five-month long takeover battle between the two rivals.</p>
<p>It will pay $1.8bn (£1.1bn) in cash, or $65 per Jos A Bank share. </p>
<p>The combined entity will be the fourth-largest men's clothing retailer in the US with annual sales of nearly $3.5bn. </p>
<p>Jos A Bank had offered to buy its bigger rival last year. But that offer was rejected and Men's Wearhouse countered the move with a bid to acquire Jos A Bank.  </p>
<p>The two firms agreed to enter talks after Men's Wearhouse raised it offer. </p>
<p>"Together, Men's Wearhouse and Jos A Bank will have increased scale and breadth, and Jos A Bank's strong brand and complementary business model will broaden our customer reach," Doug Ewert, chief executive of Men's Wearhouse, <a class="story-body__link-external" href="http://ir.menswearhouse.com/press-releases/detail/1294/mens-wearhouse-to-acquire-jos-a-bank-for-65-00-per-share-in-cash">said in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>The price offered by Men's Wearhouse is a 56% premium to what Jos A Bank shares were trading at when the takeover battle between the two firms began in October last year. </p>
<p>Analysts said the deal was a good outcome for Jos A Bank's shareholders.</p>
<p>"A merger with Men's Wearhouse was always the likeliest of outcomes, it's just that Jos A Bank wanted to extract every penny from its suitor," said Brian Sozzi, chief executive of Belus Capital Advisors.</p>
<p>Jerry Reisman, a mergers and acquisitions expert at law firm Reisman Peirez Reisman and Capobianco, said: "It's a second Christmas for Jos A Bank shareholders."</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Jos A Bank will terminate its agreement to acquire Everest Holdings, the parent company of Eddie Bauer.  </p>
