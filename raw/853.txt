  One of the big market stories of the weekend/week: The Chinese
  Yuan weakened again after China announced over the weekend that
  it would widen the "band" in which the currency was allowed to
  trade. Basically, the government sets a midpoint price, and now
  there's a 2% band around that price around which the market can
  move the value of the currency. Previously the band was set at
  1%.

  As you can see in this chart of the US dollar vs. the yuan, the
  yuan has been falling a lot lately, and last night it dropped
  again.
