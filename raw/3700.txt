<p>Investing.com - Gold prices extended gains from the previous
session on Tuesday, as lingering concerns over the standoff in
Ukraine continued to support safe haven buying.</p>
<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery held in a range between $1,338.10 a troy
ounce and $1,348.10 an ounce.</p>
<p>Gold last traded at $1,346.80 an ounce during European morning
hours, up 0.4%, or $5.30. Gold futures advanced 0.25%, or $3.30 an
ounce, on Monday to settle at $1,341.50.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Prices were likely to find support at $1,319.30 a troy ounce,
the low from February 28 and resistance at $1,355.00, the high from
March 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.45%, or $0.09
cents, to trade at $21.00 a troy ounce. Silver ended Monday's
session down 0.09%, or $0.01 cents, to settle at $20.91 an
ounce.</p>
<p>Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension
over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have
heightened demand for safe haven assets.</p>
<p>Gold gains were limited amid growing expectations that the
Federal Reserve will continue to gradually reduce the pace of its
asset purchase program.</p>
<p>Data released last week showed that the U.S. economy added
175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new
jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January,
as more people joined the workforce.</p>
<p>The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic
data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the
Fed is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying
program.</p>
<p>Market players will be anticipating what will be closely-watched
U.S. data on retail sales and consumer sentiment later in the week
for further indications of the strength of the economy and the
future course of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery inched
up 0.6% to trade at $3.049 a pound.</p>
<p>Copper plunged to an eight-month low of $2.995 a pound on
Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy
dampened demand for growth-linked assets.</p>
<p>Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February.</p>
