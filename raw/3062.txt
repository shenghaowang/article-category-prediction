<p>Experts have always considered investing in real estate an outstanding investment. However, the house you live in isnât necessarily an investment: True real estate investments are typically comprised of buying, holding, fixing and flipping rental properties, forming REITs, handling short-term rentals and more.</p>
<p>When you invest in in real estate, itâs key to keep your emotions out of the equation. You wonât be buying a house that youâre going to live in or pass down to your children, so you need to look at the property simply as a tool thatâs going to generate an additional stream of income for you.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to invest in real estate is through buying rental properties. You purchase a home or apartment building âfix it up if you need to â and rent it out. Rental properties allow someone else to pay down your mortgage and then some.</p>
<p>There is a lot to learn, so be sure you do your research on GOBankingRates first.</p>
