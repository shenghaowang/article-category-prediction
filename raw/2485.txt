<p class="speakable"><span class="dateline">LONDON – </span>Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is set to address accusations that the central bank condoned or was aware of manipulation in the foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p class="speakable">Carney appears before an influential committee of lawmakers Tuesday days after the bank suspended a member of staff while it investigates the allegations. So far, the bank has found no evidence that staff colluded in market manipulation or in sharing confidential client information.</p>
<p>Regulators say the scandal threatens to be as serious as the rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.</p>
<p>Carney&amp;aposs deputy, Andrew Bailey has already admitted that the claims could prove "enormously damaging."</p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the sector, launched its investigation last year and said it was examining a number of firms.</p>
