<p>Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a six-month high for the
second consecutive day on Thursday, as demand for safe haven assets
remained supported amid simmering concerns over the standoff in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold
futures for April delivery rose to a session high of $1,375.20 a
troy ounce, the most since September 9.</p>
<p>Gold last traded at $1,374.40 an ounce during European morning
hours, up 0.28%, or $3.90. Gold rallied 1.77%, or $23.80 an ounce,
on Wednesday to settle at $1,370.50.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>Futures were likely to find support at $1,327.50 a troy ounce,
the low from March 10 and resistance at $1,391.70, the high from
September 9.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver for May delivery inched up 0.35%, or $0.07
cents, to trade at $21.42 a troy ounce. Silver ended Wednesday's
session up 2.61%, or $0.54 cents, to settle at $21.35 an ounce.</p>
<p>Investors continued to monitor events in Ukraine, where tension
over moves by neighboring Russia in the Crimean region have
heightened demand for safe haven assets.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that unless
Russian President Vladimir Putin pulls back from endorsing a
referendum on Crimea joining Russia, the U.S. and its allies "will
be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international
law and its encroachments on Ukraine."</p>
<p>President Obama's comments came after Leaders of the Group of
Seven biggest industrial nations warned Russia not to annex
Crimea.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the leaders said Russian annexation of
Crimea "could have grave implications for the legal order that
protects the unity and sovereignty of all states."</p>
<p>Should Russia take the step, the G-7 said it would respond with
further action "individually and collectively."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to key U.S. economic data
later in the day for further indications on the strength of the
economy and the future course of monetary policy.</p>
<p>The U.S. is to release data on retail sales and import prices,
in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless
claims.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the Comex, copper futures for May delivery slumped
0.85% to trade at $2.937 following the release of lackluster data
out of China.</p>
<p>Industrial production in China rose by an annualized rate of
8.6% in the first two months of 2014, the weakest for the first two
months of the year since 2009 and below expectations for a 9.5%
increase.</p>
<p>A separate report showed that Chinese retail sales rose by a
smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period, the slowest pace
for the first two months since 2004.</p>
<p>Copper has been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions
as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened
demand for growth-linked assets.</p>
<p>The industrial metal fell to $2.908 a pound on Wednesday, the
weakest since July 2010.</p>
