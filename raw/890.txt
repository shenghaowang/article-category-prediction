<p></p>
<p><b>Name:</b> Clyde Carlson</p>
<p><b>Age:</b> 47</p>
<p><b>City:</b> New Market</p>
<p><b>His situation:</b> Carlson, who works for a small engineering company, said his company cancelled the employees’ health insurance plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield that he liked for a new one. According to Carlson, the new plan significantly increased his co-pays, deductibles, and maximum out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p><b>What it means:</b> Carlson said he experienced the following rate increases with his new plan: monthly premium from $1,117 to $1,175; calendar deductible from $200 to $500; maximum annual out-of-pocket from $600 to $5,000; generic drug co-pay from $10 to $15; office visit co-pay from $30 to $35; emergency room visit from $0 to $200.</p>
<p><b>His view:</b> Carlson said he is “furious” about the rate increases and believes ACA is widening the gap between working and non-working Americans. “Nothing got better for us,” Carlson said. “The statement (by President Obama) that if you like your plan, you keep your plan, well, I liked my plan but I wasn’t able to keep it. Blue Cross Blue Shield did not offer that plan anymore to anybody in the state of Alabama.”</p>
