<p>International Monetary Fund official Nemat Shafik has also nabbed the seat as deputy governor for markets and banking and will take over from Paul Fisher as of 1 August 2014.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spencer Dale has taken the job as BoE executive director for financial stability while Andy Haldane will become the chief economist at the central bank.</p>
<p>Anthony Habgood is also the new Chairman of the BoE's supervisory court and has replaced David Lees, who has been Chairman of the institution since 2009.</p>
