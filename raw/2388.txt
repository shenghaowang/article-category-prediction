<p>DENVER — The state Department of Revenue released data on recreational and medical <a href="https://kdvr.com/tag/marijuana/">marijuana </a>Monday saying the state earned about $3.5 million in January.</p>
<p>The state earned about $2.9 million in total tax revenue and $592,000 in fees.</p>
<p>“The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,” said Barbara Brohl, executive director of the Department of Revenue, in a statement. “We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.”</p>

<p>Marijuana became legal to buy in Colorado in January for anyone over 21. Marijuana for medical use has been legal since 2000.</p>
<p>What happens to much of that money remains an open question. Aside from $40 million or so set aside for school construction, lawmakers will have discretion on how the money is spent.</p>
<p>Hickenlooper has already come out in favor of spending a large chunk of the cash on youth anti-drug campaigns and other priorities, but this plan is just one of many.</p>

<p>how many kids have started smoking pot just because it has become legal?  what kind of price do we put on their heads or are they just collateral damage.  not enough is being said of the damage this is doing to our kids and the people that want nothing to do with it</p>
<p>No one is forcing you to use it. We just want you to leave us alone. It is against the law to sell or give the stuff to minors.</p>
<p>Me and the kids will drink to that.</p>
<p>How about the fact that I cannot open the windows because of my smoking neighbor to get some fresh air? Who is going to stand for my family and my kids? What about my right to go to my own backyard and enjoy nice day instead of smelling weed 24/7? Government is only thinking about money and that’really sad. They dont care about our health, money first.</p>
<p>Move numnuts……………..</p>
<p>3M a month won’t get the elected fools their first $40M for education, and the ~$135M the tax and spenders anticipated reaping from their fantasy recreational revenue stream.</p>
<p>$3.5 Million? Now lets see what the TOTAL cost of the of the marijuana  regulatory arm or the state TRULY is? What is the total increased burden placed on Police, District Attorney’s and other enforcement agencies in the state? This would be very easy to find out, but we no longer have a responsible and non-biased media. Marijuana is being portrayed as a fix all elixir, and the medical issues that it creates are being ignored. Just like tobacco was during the late 19th century. Didn’t Fox just have an article where the local Law Enforcement agencies are asking the state for more money to help them? I would like to see those increased costs in comparrison to the tax collected.</p>
<p>So?…Who’s pocket is this money going into??? Obviously it’s not going into the schools. Answer me that Hickenlooper?  Oh yeah, we are going to waste it on ANTI-DRUG campaigns. Let parents DO THEIR JOB.</p>
