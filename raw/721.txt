<p>Investing.com - U.S. stocks opened lower on Monday, weighed by
the release of downbeat Chinese trade balance data, while trading
volumes were expected to remain light with no U.S. economic reports
to be released throughout the session.</p>
<p>During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
0.28%, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite
index edged down 0.11%.</p>
<p>Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell
18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding
expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in
January.</p><div id="articleText-makead"><script type="text/javascript">makeArticleAd();</script></div>
<p>A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in
China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.</p>
<p>The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second
largest economy.</p>
<p>Among tech stocks, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices was up 1.52%
after surging nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory
Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its
sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.</p>
<p>That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in
2011, according to Read.</p>
<p>In the energy sector, U.S.-traded BP shares dropped 0.35%
following reports the company is now the biggest loser among U.S.
government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's
top fuel supplier.</p>
<p>Adding to losses, McDonald's slid 0.35% after reporting a
larger-than-expected decline in comparable global sales at
established restaurants in February.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Boeing shares plummeted 2.11% after a 777-200 plane
disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight
to Beijing on March 8.</p>
<p>On Friday, the company had said that "hairline cracks" had been
found in the wings of roughly 40 787 Dreamliners currently in
production.</p>
<p>Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters,
scheduled to report quarterly results after the closing bell.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed. The EURO
STOXX 50 added 0.16%, France's CAC 40 rose 0.36%, Germany's DAX
declined 0.45%, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.23%.</p>
<p>During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index
tumbled 1.75%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index lost 1.01%.</p>
