<p>AEO stock sank after the apparel retailer said it earned just $10.5 million during its fiscal fourth quarter, a drop of 89% compared to the profit of $94.8 million it turned in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS came in at 27 cents, a penny above the earnings of 26 cents a share that the company had predicted in January, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> noted.</p>
<p>Same-store sales tumbled 7% during the quarter, though its AEO Direct online division saw sales climb 8%. Overall, AEO reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.04 billion, which narrowly beat analysts who were looking for $1.03 billion.</p>
<p>AEO interim CEO Jay Shottenstein called AEO’s performance for 2013 “highly disappointing,” conceding that AEO “fell short of expectations” in both customer experience and merchandise.</p>
<p>For the current quarter, anticipates break even adjusted earnings per share. Analysts have estimated earnings of 13 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter.</p>
<p>AEO stock closed at $14.21 a share on Monday. Over the past 12 months, AEO stock has fallen more than 30%.</p>
