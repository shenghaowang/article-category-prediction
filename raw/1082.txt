<p>After Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox reported last month that it lost nearly $500 million worth of users’ bitcoins in a security lapse, many users were not convinced with the explanation from the exchange’s owners.</p>
<p>While Mt. Gox did not provide further information about the attack, which reportedly exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, a group of hackers claimed Sunday that they broke into Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ personal blog, and found a discrepancy in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins Mt. Gox claimed were stolen in February's security lapse. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: CharisSILRegular, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;">According to a report from </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/09/hackers-hit-mt-gox-exchanges-ceo-claim-to-publish-evidence-of-fraud/" rel="nofollow" style="font-family: CharisSILRegular, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;" target="_blank">Forbes</a><span style="font-family: CharisSILRegular, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;">, the hackers gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Karpeles and posted a message, claiming that the exchange still had access to some of the bitcoins that Karpeles had reported stolen.</span></p>
<p>The hackers uploaded a series of files, including a spreadsheet of anonymous user accounts with details of bitcoin balances, Karpeles' home address, and a screenshot allegedly verifying the hackers' access to the data. In addition, the hackers also posted a 716MB zip file claimed to contain stolen data from Mt. Gox servers. Here is the link to the data on <a href="http://pastebin.com/f7DPskc7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pastebin</a>.</p>
<p>“First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,” the hackers wrote. “It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed… Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with f***ing Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.”</p>
<p>The data posted by the hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The exchange <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/us-bitcoin-mtgox-bankruptcy-idINBREA1R0FX20140228" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filed for bankruptcy</a> last month, claiming it had lost 750,000 customer bitcoins, in addition to 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.</p>
<p>While the authenticity of Sunday’s database dump has not yet been confirmed, some Reddit users said <a href="https://twitter.com/Falkvinge/status/442717570089877504" target="_blank">they had found</a> that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, CNET <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57620092-93/mt-gox-ceos-blog-hacked-alleged-bitcoin-balances-posted/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
