<p><strong>STOCK INDEX FUTURES</strong></p>
<p>Prices advanced in the overnight trade after Stanley Fischer, who is nominated to be Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's deputy, said in a prepared statement that the U.S. economy still is in need of stimulus. </p>
<p>There were additional gains when the better than expected 7:30 economic reports were released.</p>
<p>February retail sales increased .3%, which compares to the estimate of a .2% advance and retail sales, excluding autos, were up .3% when a .1 increase was estimated.</p>
<p>Jobless claims in the week ended March 8 declined 9,000 to 315,000, which compares to the median estimate of 330,000.  </p>
<p>The 9:00 central time January business inventories report is expected to be up .4% and the Treasury's 1:00 budget statement for February is anticipated to show a $195 billion deficit.</p>
<p>The main trend for stock index futures is higher. </p>
<p><strong>CURRENCY FUTURES</strong></p>
<p>The euro advanced to over a two year high against the U.S. dollar on limited news. </p>
<p>The British pound gained due to the growing belief that the Bank of England will increase interest rates sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The Japanese yen is a little lower on ideas that Japan's economy is likely to slow in the second quarter when Japan's sales tax increases from 5% to 8% on April 1. </p>
<p>The Australian dollar gained after a report showed a surge in the number of full time employees by 80,500, which is the largest increase since 1991. </p>
<p>Political tensions in Ukraine did not help the U.S. dollar for very long, which has to be viewed as a sign of weakness. </p>
<p>Longer term, expect the U.S. dollar to come under downside pressure due to unfavorable trends in interest rate differentials. </p>
<p><strong>INTEREST RATE MARKET FUTURES </strong></p>
<p>Prices are lower as a result of the stronger than expected 7:30 U.S. economic reports.</p>
<p>It is widely anticipated that the Fed will announce another $10 billion of taper of its quantitative easing program at the conclusion of the March 18-19 Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.</p>
<p>Currently the Federal Reserve is buying a total of $65 billion of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities every month.</p>
<p>Longer term, futures are likely to work higher due to continuing political tensions in Ukraine, slower economic growth in China and falling prices for industrial commodities.</p>
<p>Expect futures to trade higher from the current lower levels.</p>
