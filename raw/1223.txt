<p>* To end ticketing agreement effective Monday </p>
<p>* To also end reciprocal frequent-flyer program </p>
<p>* Merger with US Airways gives “greater connectivity” - spokesman </p>
<p>March 10 (Reuters) - American Airlines said it planned to end agreements covering ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs with JetBlue Airways after its merger with US Airways gave it “greater connectivity” along the U.S. East Coast. </p>
<p>American Airlines, which merged with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group Inc, had a so-called interline agreement with JetBlue that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other’s planes on one ticket. </p>
<p>New York-based JetBlue has 80 percent of its operations in the U.S. Northeast. </p>
<p>“Through the merger with US Airways, American’s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement,” American Airlines’ spokesman Casey Norton wrote in an email to Reuters. </p>
<p>Carriers enter into interline agreements because they allow them to offer more destinations without having to make large investments. </p>
<p>The partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have,” JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said at a JP Morgan conference in New York City on Monday. </p>
<p>JetBlue, which has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, also said it expected unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1-2 percent in the current quarter. </p>
<p>American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other from Monday, the companies said in a statement. </p>
<p>The carriers also said customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs would no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1. </p>
<p>The frequent-flyer program agreement between the two includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. </p>
<p>All American Airlines’ “AAdvantage” miles or JetBlue’s “TrueBlue” points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected, the carriers said. </p>
<p>American Airlines Group also said its February load factor, or percentage of seats sold, fell to 78.4 percent from 78.7 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>American Airlines shares were down about 1 percent at $38.55 in early trading. JetBlue’s shares were down 0.55 percent.</p>
