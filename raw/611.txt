<p>General Motors has offered $500 towards the purchase of a new car for current owners who have been affected by the controversial ignition-switch recall.</p>
<p>The company cautions that it is not offering vehicle repurchases in response to the recall, however <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140312/AUTO0103/303120064/1148/rss25"><em>The Detroit News</em></a> suggests the company already repurchased at least 13  <a href="//www.leftlanenews.com/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> Cobalts due to reports of the problem in 2005 in 2006. With more than 1.5 million vehicles involved in the recall, a broader buyback program would be unprecedented.</p>
<p>"<span>To assist dealers in helping customers who are involved in this recall that request assistance, we are announcing a special cash allowance in the amount $500 available when these customers purchase or lease a new 2013/ 2014 / 2015 model year Chevrolet,  <a href="//www.leftlanenews.com/buick/">Buick</a>,  <a href="//www.leftlanenews.com/gmc/">GMC</a> or  <a href="//www.leftlanenews.com/cadillac/">Cadillac</a>," the company wrote in a notice to dealers.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>At least 12 deaths have been officially associated on the issue, which can spontaneously shut off the engine and disable the airbags, though separate reports claim more than 50 people may have been killed in accidents caused by the defect.</p>
<p>The investigations primarily focus on why GM knew about the problems as early as 2004 but waited an entire decade before issuing a recall.</p>
