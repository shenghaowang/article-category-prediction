<p>Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.</p>
<p>Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.</p>
<p>In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China's exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.</p>
<p>In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.</p>
<p>The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.</p>
<p>"It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Ron+Florance%22">Ron Florance</a>, deputy chief investment officer at <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Wells+Fargo+Private+Bank%22">Wells Fargo Private Bank</a>. "We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it's) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It's going to be par for the course for this year."</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.</p>
<p>The <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Dow+Jones+industrial+average%22">Dow Jones industrial average</a> lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.</p>
<p>The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&amp;P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.</p>
<p>The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&amp;P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.</p>
<p>"The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22David+Chalupnik%22">David Chalupnik</a>, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.</p>
<p>Despite the disappointing data, some market watchers anticipate that last week's gains will continue.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of the severe winter, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also encouraged investors.</p>
