<p class="speakable">The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and his Republican counterpart announced Tuesday that they had reached an agreement to dissolve the bailed-out government-sponsored mortgage enterprises and reform federal housing finance policy.</p>
<p class="speakable">Sens. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a joint press release that they would release legislative text in upcoming days that would closely mirror an existing bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators on the committee, led by Sens. <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/mark-warner" target="_blank">Mark Warner</a>, D-Va., and <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/bob-corker" target="_blank">Bob Corker</a>, R-Tenn.</p>
<p>Both bills would wind down and eliminate the mortgage behemoths <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/section/fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac" target="_blank">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</a>, which were taken into federal conservatorship after failing in 2008 and have remained in the government&amp;aposs control since. In recent months, the two companies have returned to profitability, so far yielding the government more in dividends than the $187.5 billion it cost to bail them out.</p>
<p>Both senate measures would also institute a Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, modeled on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that provides depositors&amp;apos insurance for banks. The FMIC would provide insurance on approved mortgage-backed securities that would only kick in once the private owners of those securities had suffered some losses. The FMIC would be intended to ensure a liquid market for mortgage securities while also avoiding taxpayer losses on guaranteed loans.</p>
