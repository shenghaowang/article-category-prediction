<p>An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world’s most valuable life insurance policy.</p>
<p>The man who cobbled the deal together said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million (R1.1 billion at current rates) policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990. </p>
<p>“Not one company can afford to take a $201m hit,” said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a man he called “a well-known billionaire”.</p>
<p><em>The Guinness Book of World Records</em> announced the surpassing of Geffen’s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said. “It was worse than any audit you can think of.”</p>
<p>Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen’s policy.</p>
<p>Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG, which has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.</p>
<p>He said the billionaire wanted to remain anonymous for the sake of privacy, and to keep the news from his beneficiaries. “He wants his next of kin to keep working hard.” </p>
<p>He said the man purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax on his death. – Daily Mail</p>
