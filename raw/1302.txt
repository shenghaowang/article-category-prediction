<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;"><em>What to watch for today</em></strong></p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>New Zealand hikes its rates. </strong>The economy has steadied since earthquakes rattled Christchurch, and strong dairy exports have boosted business, so <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/what-matters-in-the-week-ahead-3/">this could be the month</a> that New Zealand’s central bank begins raising interest rates after leaving them untouched previously.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>Good news for Australian workers, or at least, no worse. </strong>The country expects a bump in new jobs after a fall last month, though <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11217289">not by enough to budge the unemployment rate</a>, which is at a ten-and-a-half-year high. Signs that China may be slowing down again <a href="http://www.alpari.co.uk/newsroom/weekly-market-preview-10-march-2014/">don’t augur well for the recovery</a>.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>Lufthansa’s profits soar.</strong> Lufthansa expects to post a full-year operating profit of up to €700 million ($973.28 million), compared to €524 million in the previous year. Investors will be looking to see whether the German airline will <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a6cf956e-a2d0-11e3-9685-00144feab7de.html#axzz2vUacaeg6">reinstate the dividend it axed last year</a> (paywall); some analysts expect €0.45 per share.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><b>American spending gets back in the black. </b>Analysts expect retail sales <a href="http://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-retail-sales,-february-2014-preview:-slight-rise-expected-205713">to have grown 0.1%</a> last month, after contracting by 0.1% in December and 0.4% in January. As 70% of GDP is driven by consumer spending, this would be happy news for the US economy.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>The pope’s anniversary.</strong> It’s one year to the day since white smoke billowed out of the Sistine Chapel’s chimney, and Pope Francis will be marking the occasion with <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0309/Pope-Francis-marks-first-anniversary-of-his-papacy">a spiritual retreat outside the Vatican</a>. Watch out for rehashed reports about how the pope has shaken up the Church—or hasn’t.</p>

<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>An historic IPO got priced.</strong> King Digital Entertainment unveiled a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/12/candy-crush-saga-floats-stock-market-king-digital">$21- to $24-per-share price range for its IPO</a>, meaning it could raise more than $530 million when it lists in New York. That values the company behind hit game Candy Crush Saga at $7.6 billion, making it Britain’s most valuable publicly listed internet company.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>A Goldman banker was told to pay up.</strong> Fabrice Tourre, a former Goldman Sachs banker, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/12/us-goldmansachs-sec-tourre-idUSBREA2B11220140312">fined $650,000 and ordered to forgo a $175,463 bonus</a> for misleading investors over a faulty subprime mortgage package. It’s one of the few instances in which an individual has been held personally responsible for a financial crisis case.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>A building blew up in New York City.</strong> Two people were killed and 22 injured when <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexmorrell/2014/03/12/first-hand-account-of-deadly-explosion-in-east-harlem/">two adjacent buildings exploded in Harlem</a>. Authorities attributed the explosion to a gas leak, and power company Con Edison said it had dispatched two crews to the scene on reports of a gas odor.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>The FTC launched a probe into Herbalife.</strong> Shares in Herbalife fell 13% after the Federal Trade Commission said it was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/federal-trade-commission-investigate-herbalife/story?id=22882424">investigating the health-products company</a>. It’s a <a href="http://qz.com/187099/at-last-a-break-for-bill-ackman-on-his-herbalife-bet/">victory for activist investor Bill Ackman</a>, who has claimed since 2012 that Herbalife is operating an illegal pyramid scheme.</p>
<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>Panasonic unveiled a smog salary.</strong> Panasonic said it would <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9567823e-a9b3-11e3-adab-00144feab7de.html#axzz2vUacaeg6">pay a premium to workers it sends to China</a> (paywall), due to the hazardously high levels of pollution there that can increase a person’s risk of asthma, cancer or heart problems. The wage hike applies only to foreign workers in China, not Chinese employees.</p>

<p class="_92842 quartz"><strong>Leo Mirani on what the future of in-car navigation will look like.</strong> “Carmakers have been experimenting with head-up displays (HUD) in cars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oPqDeMZD94">since the late 1990s</a>. But early efforts have been cautious, displaying only speed and other basic information near the bottom of the windscreen. New technologies allow them to be bolder: the authors see HUD, long used by fighter pilots, as becoming a natural part of looking through the windshield, and, in some cases, being embedded on real-world objects such as the road or buildings. It is Borges’s 1:1 map come to life.” Read more <a href="http://qz.com/186356/heres-what-the-future-of-car-navigation-looks-like/" title="Here’s what the future of car navigation looks like">here</a>.</p>
