<p class="element element-paragraph text-align-override-left">  New York â€¢ It&amp;aposs time to suit up: Men&amp;aposs Wearhouse is buying Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph text-align-override-left">Men&amp;aposs Wearhouse Inc. will pay $65 per share, a 5 percent premium to Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.&amp;aposs closing price Monday of $61.83.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph text-align-override-left">The agreement ends a months-long back and forth that began in October when Jos. A. Bank offered to buy its larger rival for $2.3 billion. Men&amp;aposs Wearhouse scoffed at that offer, and turned the tables, offering to buy its rival for $1.54 billion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph text-align-override-left">By early March Men&amp;aposs Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph text-align-override-left">The combined company will be the fourth-biggest U.S. men&amp;aposs clothing retailer with more than 1,700 U.S. stores and about $3.5 billion in sales.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph text-align-override-left">The transaction is expected to close by the third quarter.      </p>
