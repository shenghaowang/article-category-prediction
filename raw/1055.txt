Regulators in various countries are grappling with bitcoin. What the hell is it? It's a good question and answers vary widely.<br/>
<br/>
Bloomberg reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-07/japan-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-currency-amid-calls-for-regulation.html">Japan Says Bitcoin Not Currency Amid Calls for Regulation</a>.
</p>
<p>
The answer to my question is yes, no, don't know, and it depends (dependent on what country you are in).<br/>

<strong>Newsweek Unmasks Bitcoin Inventor</strong><br/>
<br/>
Two day ago, Newsweek unmasked Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html">The Face Behind Bitcoin</a>. It's a fascinating article, and one well worth a look.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a paragraph that caught my attention.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Denial, Bizarre Media Road Chase </strong><br/>
<br/>
The Guardian reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/07/satoshi-nakamoto-denies-inventing-bitcoin">Satoshi Nakamoto: man denies being bitcoin inventor amid media frenzy</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Followup Statement</strong> <br/>
<br/>
Newsweek issued a <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/newsweeks-statement-bitcoin-story-231242">followup statement</a> in regards to the denials ... "Newsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article. Ms. Goodman’s reporting was motivated by a search for the truth surrounding a major business story, absent any other agenda. The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto’s role in the founding of Bitcoin."<br/>
<br/>
I believe Newsweek has it correct. Leah McGrath Goodman did a fantsatic job of investigative reporting. <br/>
