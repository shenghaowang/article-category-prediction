<p>More than 5 million people have signed up for health care plans under the newly created Obamacare insurance exchanges, according to a Monday press release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>According to the release, “the last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone — the busiest day since December 23 — and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend.”</p>
<p>The 5 million figure comes on March 17, meaning that there have been roughly 800,000 enrollments in the last 17 days. That’s a pace of 50,000 or so enrollments a day, which would put the administration on pace to hit 5.7 million by the end of the month.</p>
