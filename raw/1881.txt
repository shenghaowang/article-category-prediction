<p>New York - US stocks declined on Wednesday, putting the S&amp;P 500 on track for a third straight decline after its most recent record high, as concerns grew over the strength of China's economy. </p>
<p>London copper, seen as a proxy for China's economic health, fell for a fourth day to its lowest level since July 2010.</p>
<p>Recent China data suggested an economic slowdown, while the country's first-ever bond default last week increased concerns financing deals that use the industrial metal as collateral could unravel.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P materials index fell 0.3 percent. </p>
<p>Investors also continue to monitor geopolitical developments as earnings season has drawn to a close and amid a light economic calendar, leaving no catalyst to push the benchmark S&amp;P index higher after its most recent record close on Friday. </p>
<p>“We've climbed so far, to continue to climb is definitely going to be a see-saw move,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. </p>
<p>“There are enough investors willing to take profits here that they continue, on any bad global news, to start to make some sales. Here, certainly China is a big part of it and the Ukraine situation is really not cleared in any way.” </p>
<p>Ukraine's government appealed for Western help on Tuesday to stop Moscow annexing Crimea, but the Black Sea peninsula, overrun by Russian troops, seemed fixed on a course that could formalise rule from Moscow within days. </p>
<p>EU member states have agreed the wording of sanctions on Russia, including travel restrictions and asset freezes against those responsible for violating the sovereignty of Ukraine, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. </p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.75 points or 0.24 percent, to 16,312.5, the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.64 points or 0.3 percent, to 1,861.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.967 points or 0.25 percent, to 4,296.221. </p>
<p>EPL Oil &amp; Gas Inc jumped 29.8 percent to $37.78 after the company agreed to be acquired by larger rival Energy XXI Ltd for $2.3 billion, including debt.</p>
<p>Energy XXI shares lost 5.7 percent to $22.03. </p>
<p>Express Inc dropped 9.4 percent to $16.52 after the apparel retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a profit for the current quarter that fell far short of analyst expectations. </p>
<p>Oxigene Inc surged 94.2 percent to $4.67.</p>
<p>The company said its experimental drug Zybrestat, combined with Roche's cancer drug Avastin, significantly slowed progression of recurrent ovarian cancer better than Avastin alone in a midstage clinical trial. </p>
<p>Geron Corp plunged 65 percent to $1.54.</p>
<p>The company said the US Food and Drug Administration ordered a halt to trials of its cancer drug imetelstat over concerns about potential liver damage. - Reuters</p>
