Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pushed his message that there¡¯s no rush to increase U.K. interest rates, saying there may be more slack in the economy than the central bank¡¯s calculations show. 

 

Speaking to lawmakers today, he said the amount of spare capacity is "at the upper end" of the 1% to 1.5% of gross domestic product estimated by the BOE in its Inflation Report last month. His comments underline a key area of divergence among officials, after policy maker Martin Weale said the level of slack may be overstated. 

 

The central bank refocused its interest-rate policy, known as forward guidance, on spare capacity last month. The revamp came after unemployment fell faster than forecast toward the 7 percent threshold it set for considering a rate increase. 

 

Noting comments by Deputy Governor Charlie Bean yesterday that the key rate may settle at about 2% to 3% once tightening begins, he indicated agreement with that outlook. The BOE¡¯s benchmark interest rate is currently at a record-low 0.5% 

 

Carney also said today it will take "several" interest-rate increases before the BOE begins unwinding its 375-billion-pound quantitative-easing program. 

 

The strongest economic expansion since 2007 has shifted investor focus to when the BOE¡¯s unprecedented stimulus will be removed. As part of the next phase of guidance, the debate on the timing of rate increases will hinge on policy makers¡¯ assessment of slack in the economy.
