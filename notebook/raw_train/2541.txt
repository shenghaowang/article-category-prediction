As expected, China has widened the daily trading band for the yuan¡¯s value against the dollar. For the most part, economic circles are greeting the move with a yawn, though the consensus is that this could slow (or just maybe even stop) the Chinese currency¡¯s long, upward crawl in the near term.

First of all, there seems to be agreement that this isn¡¯t a very big deal in the grand scheme of things. This, because the central bank will still set its desired ¡°parity rate¡± (the level that determines the center of each day¡¯s trading band, now widened to 2% above or below the parity rate).

Soci¨¦t¨¦ G¨¦n¨¦rale China economist Wei Yao says: ¡°Widening the band is a relatively easy promise to deliver. The more difficult and more meaningful one is for the People¡¯s Bank of China to really let go its control over the exchange rate.¡±

Likewise, Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams says: ¡°If the PBOC was really confident that the renminbi [another name for the yuan] was now close to its market value, it would leave the reference rate to the market. But that still, apparently, remains a step too far.¡±

While the move may be small potatoes to some, many economists also say it¡¯s not completely without consequence. Generally, they see the change to the trading band as more likely to weigh on China¡¯s currency than to send it rising faster.

Although Standard Chartered said the wider band ¡°does not have direct implications for medium-term yuan appreciation or depreciation dynamics,¡± it adds that the change makes their previous target for the yuan look ¡°a little aggressive.¡±

As a result, StanChart now sees the dollar buying 6.02 yuan at the end of the third quarter, up from 5.98 yuan previously. On the other hand, the bank¡¯s year-end projection remains at 5.92 yuan.

Over at Daiwa, they¡¯re taking a stronger view that the yuan will now weaken ¡ª you can read the details of this argument in Craig Stephen¡¯s ¡°This Week in China¡± column.

J.P. Morgan also sees a weaker yuan, but just for the near term (they keep their year-end forecast at 5.95 yuan). They note that the last time the trading band was widened in 2012, the yuan fell in value for a short while. And certainly, we¡¯ve seen some pullback for the yuan this month already.

Of course, any weakening in the Chinese currency helps Chinese exporters, and J.P. Morgan says a softer yuan would also stop those pesky hot-money inflows that has worried the PBOC recently. So maybe this is a good thing, for China at least.
