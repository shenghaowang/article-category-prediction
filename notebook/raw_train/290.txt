Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is quizzed by MPs over claims some of the bank's officials knew about alleged foreign exchange rate fixing.

His appearance before the Treasury Select Committee comes a week after it emerged that some officials were aware of rigging attempts as early as 2006.

The bank said there was no evidence its staff had colluded to rig the market.

MPs are also questioning Mr Carney over other financial issues, including the possibility of a currency union.
