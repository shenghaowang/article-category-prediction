(NBC News) Newly released numbers show Colorado brought in a total of $3.5 million in marijuana taxes and fees in January, the state's first month of legal recreational sales.

During the January launch the state says customers bought just over $14 million worth of recreational pot.

The state also collected around $1.5 million in tax revenue from medical marijuana.

Still, Governor John Hickenlooper calls for caution when considering future spending.

"I don't think we should become dependent on revenues or start thinking wow look at those revenues," he says.

The governor's spending priorities for the tax money includes youth prevention, substance abuse treatment and public health.
