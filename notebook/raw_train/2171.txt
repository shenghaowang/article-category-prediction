Herbalife is facing an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission.

 

The nutrition and supplement maker said Wednesday that it received the civil investigative demand from the FTC on Wednesday. A representative from the FTC was not immediately available to comment.

 

Herbalife says it welcomes the inquiry, saying there is a "tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace" about its business. The company says it believes it is in compliance with all laws and regulations and plans to cooperate fully.

 

The company made the announcement just a day after hedge fund manager William Ackman renewed his attacks on the company. Ackman repeatedly has bet against the company and says he believes it operates as a pyramid scheme.
