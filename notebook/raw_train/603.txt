NEW YORK (MainStreet)  One-third of Americans who don't have insurance do not plan to purchase any despite the Affordable Care Act's requirement that they obtain health insurance or pay a fine, according to a Bankrate.com report.

While 41% of the uninsured respondents who plan to stay uninsured are choosing to do so because they think health insurance is too costly, a whopping 70% of uninsured Americans don't know about the subsidies available to reduce the cost of health insurance.

"This is a staggeringly high percentage," said Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman. "The government has spent over half a billion dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act and more than two-thirds of uninsured Americans still don't know about the subsidies. Plus, fewer than half or 48% know that the enrollment deadline is in two weeks."

Another startling fact is that 53% of uninsured Americans do not know that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is March 31, 2014.

"It is still disturbing that people still know so little," he said. "Health insurance is such a complicated topic to begin with. It doesn't surprise me that people are still confused."

While 66% of uninsured 18-29 year-olds say they will sign up for health insurance this month, another 28% say they will stay uninsured.

"These results are encouraging and the bright spot in the survey," said Whiteman.

Of those that will stay uninsured, 31% say they will do so because they are healthy and do not need health insurance.

Many consumers still mistakenly believe that missing the March 31 deadline equates to just paying a $95 penalty, said Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif.

"We're finding from consumers calling into our customer care center that they don't understand what the March 31 deadline really means," she said.
