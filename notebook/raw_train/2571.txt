Japan has ruled that bitcoin is not legal tender but could still be the subject of taxation and anti money-laundering rules.

The Japanese Ministry of Finance admitted it did not really understand the crypto-currency despite the fact the country was home to its largest trading exchange, Mt.Gox, until it went bust last week. ¡°It¡¯s not money,¡± said finance minister Taro Aso adding that ¡°opinions are divided¡± as to which agency controls it.

A six-page document drawn up for the government suggests that bitcoin could be treated like a commodity such as gold.
