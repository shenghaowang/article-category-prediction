House Republican leaders are adopting an agreed-upon conservative approach to fixing the nation¡¯s health care system, in part to draw an election-year contrast with President Obama¡¯s Affordable Care Act.



The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.



The tenets of the plan ¨Cwhich could expand to include the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations ¨C are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.



But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. 



This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with members outlining the plan, called ¡°A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,¡± with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents.



¡°We¡¯ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,¡± House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, said in an interview. ¡°We¡¯ve got all of these bills out there, so we¡¯re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.¡±



Democrats dismissed the Republican approach as a purely political gesture ahead of this year¡¯s midterm elections.
