In company news, Men's Wearhouse ( MW ) said Tuesday it will buy its smaller rival Jos. A. Bank ( JOSB ) for $65 a share in cash, or $1.8 billion in total, sending JOSB shares up about 4% to all-time highs off a trading halt.

The accepted offer is above the previous bid, of $63.50 a share, which Jos. A. Bank had rejected in late February.

Jos. A. Bank, meanwhile, said it will terminate its deal to buy Eddie Bauer. The company had said in February that the termination fee for Eddie Bauer would be equal to less than 3% of Jos. A. Bank's equity value based on Men's Wearhouse's tender-offer price at the time.

J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP ) shares rallied Tuesday, advancing over 8% after analysts at Citigroup today recommended buying the retailer's stock, citing its budding turnaround.

The department-store retailer last week reported a 2% rise in Q4 sales at stores open at least 12 months or more, which "bodes well" for future sales growth, according to Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen in a new research note today explaining his upgrade for the stock to Buy from Neutral.

JCP "is early in this go-forward phase but we like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014," Chen wrote.

JCP shares were up 8.6% at $9.21 each in recent trade, climbing to an intra-day high of $9.28 a share and, at least temporarily, erasing the stock's year-to-date drop in its share price. The stock slid to a 52-week low of $4.90 a share on Feb. 4 and again on Feb. 5 despite reporting positive growth of 3.1% in same-store sales during the nine weeks including the Q4 holiday season. Since that time, the stock was risen almost 72% through Monday's close.
