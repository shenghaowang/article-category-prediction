Yahoo is benefiting once again from its stake in China's hottest internet company, Alibaba Group.

Investors latched on to Yahoo on Monday in anticipation of a huge windfall from Alibaba's initial public offering of stock later this year. Yahoo's stock gained $US1.51, or four per cent, to close at $US39.11.

Alibaba ignited the excitement about its forthcoming IPO by announcing plans to list its stock on a US exchange.

Yahoo Inc is expected to sell about half its 24 per cent stake in Alibaba as part of an IPO that analysts believe could raise $US15 billion ($A16.78 billion). That means Yahoo is likely to collect several billion dollars from AIibaba's IPO. That money could then be used to pay a special dividend to shareholders or buy back more of its stock.
