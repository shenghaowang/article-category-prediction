Bloomberg is citing analysts at the White House who report that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will stay profitable while under conservatorship for the next ten years.

In fact, citing annual analysis prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, there is a predicted $179 billion profit expected from the government-sponsored enterprises.

If so, that is a significant shrinkage in market share. Consider that since 2008, Fannie and Freddie returned $202 billion "to taxpayers."

But only recently were those profits realized, with loses and draws during the first few years.

$179 billion in profits from the next ten years predicts a huge mortgage slowdown for the GSEs.
