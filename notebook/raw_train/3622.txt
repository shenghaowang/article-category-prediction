German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz has started assembling its S Class model locally in India (at their Chakan plant in Pune), said the company on Wednesday.

The company, which started bringing its 2014 Mercedes S Class as a completely built unit (CBU) to India, has also rolled out its first locally assembled S500 from its Chakan plant. 2014 Mercedes S Class S500 originally priced at 1.57 crore (ex-showroom Delhi) is now available at 1.36 crore, which is about 20 lakhs cheaper than the CBU model.

The car draws its power from the 4.7l V8 engine, which can churn out a power of 455 hp at 5250 rpm and a torque of 700 Nm at 1800-3500 rpm. It is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and can accelerate from 0-100 kmph in just 4.4 seconds. The company claims a top speed of 250 kmph for its new luxury sedan.

The company sells a wide range of cars in India, such as A Class, B Class, sedans C Class, E Class, S Class and SLS AMG. Beside S Class, Mercedes also assemble E-Class, C-Class, GL-Class and the M-Class models locally in India.

"No other car stands for Mercedes-Benz brand promise more than the S-Class and we are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the art production facility in Chakan, Pune. Quality has all along been the strength of Mercedes-Benz India, and the new S500 production in India is set to take this success story even further," said Eberhard Kern, managing director and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India, according to AutoCar India.

Recently, the company opened its state-of-the art second dealership in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Mercedes Benz's new dealership Benchmark Cars is spread over a total area of 11000 sq. ft. The showroom offers facilities like customer lounge, accessories, collections display and easy one stop shopping. Currently, Mercedes-Benz India has 62 outlets in 35 cities, and the company is also planning to expand its network in the country.
