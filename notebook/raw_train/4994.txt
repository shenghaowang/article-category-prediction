As the Turkish government¡¯s effort to ban use of Twitter continued Friday, the country¡¯s Internet users rushed to install apps such as Hotspot Shield, which had 270,000 downloads from Turkish users within 12 hours, according to David Gorodyansky, the company¡¯s chief executive. On a typical day, there would be 10,000 downloads in Turkey.

Gorodyansky said he wasn¡¯t able to calculate actual usage, just the number of downloads of the app.
