Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, prices are expected to rise at a faster pace for both energy (9.5 percent vs 9.2 percent in August) and unprocessed food (3.2 percent vs 2.5 percent). Meanwhile, inflation should slow for processed food, alcohol & tobacco (2.3 percent vs 2.4 percent) and remain unchanged for services (at 1.3 percent) and non-energy industrial goods (at 0.4 percent)



 Annual core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of energy, food, alcohol & tobacco and at which the ECB looks in its policy decisions, is likely to ease to 0.9 percent in September from 1 percent in August, below market consensus of 1.1 percent.
