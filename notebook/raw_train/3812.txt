
 None A GM service technician sees a Saturn Ion stall while it is being driven with "several other keys on the key ring." The technician writes in his report that "the additional weight of the keys had worn out the ignition switch."
 None Engineers propose that the head of the key be redesigned so that things hanging from the key are less likely to jostle it. That proposal is initially approved, but then cancelled. GM documents said that, among other things, the fix was too costly.
 None Delphi, the company that makes the switch, proposes an ignition design change. A GM engineer signs off on the changes and the new part goes into production. But the part number is not changed, so most of the automaker¡¯s employees are not aware of the fix.
 None A GM engineer is assigned to look at Cobalt front crashes in which the airbags did not deploy, in order to identify common characteristics. In four of nine crashes, the ignition was not in "Run" at the time of impact.
 None An official with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration pushed to open an investigation after noticing "a pattern of reported (airbag) non-deployments" involving Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions. But the official was blocked by others in the department who didn't believe action was warranted.
 None GM hires outside engineers to conduct a thorough assessment of ignition switches from cars made before and after 2007. They conclude that changes were made to the ignition switch sometime after the cars rst went into production.
 None March 4: GM CEO Mary Barra defends how the company is handling the much-criticized recall, but pledges to conduct an internal review. "We will hold ourselves accountable and improve our processes so our customers do not experience this again." Says repairs to recalled cars should start in early April.
 None March 17: Barra issues a new statement on the automakers' handling of a flawed ignition switch, calling it a tragic situation in which "terrible things happened." Says GM will change the way it handles recalls, and that repairs "should start" the second week of April.
 None April 1 & 2: Barra and NHTSA acting administrator David Friedman testify before Congress. Barra says GM doesn't know why it took 10 years to issue a recall. Barra also reveals GM hired attorney Ken Feinberg, who is best known for determining how to compensate victims of tragedies including the Sept. 11 attacks, the BP oil spill and the Boston Marathon bombing. NHTSA¡¯s Friedman contends GM didn¡¯t provide the agency with all the information it needed.
 None June 30: General Motors offered at least $1 million to the families of those who died as a result of a defect in GM cars. The compensation plan, administered by Ken Feinberg, will take into account the number of dependents a victim had and their future earning potential. It will also pay people injured in crashes tied to the defect. GM said it won¡¯t cap the compensation program, but that families that accept these funds will waive their right to sue the automaker.
 None June 30: GM recalls another 8.4 million vehicles worldwide, mostly for faulty ignition switches. It also raised the charge it will take in the second quarter for recall-related expenses to $1.2 billion.
