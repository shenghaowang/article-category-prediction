Mercedes-Benz¡¯s latest S-Class will soon be available in hybrid and plug-in hybrid forms , with the latter promising fuel economy of up to 78 mpg when it arrives on the market early next year. However, further down the track we could see a pure electric version of the popular luxury sedan that would compete in a segment that at present is comprised of only the Tesla Model S.

Speaking with the Top Gear website at the recent 2014 Geneva Motor Show, Dr. Uwe Ernstberger, the man in charge of Mercedes¡¯ large car program, said that while there were no plans for an electric S-Class right now, one would be launched in the future.

The key factor holding back Mercedes from launching an electric S-Class are the required batteries.

"We have to work on the capacities of the batteries to get a better package in the car," Ernstberger explained. "You do not want to lose all the comfort features of an S-Class for transporting a battery only.¡±

Mercedes has demonstrated a major commitment to the electrification of the car, so Ernstberger¡¯s comments about an all-electric S-Class shouldn¡¯t come as much of a surprise. The automaker has already offered an electric car for several years through its Smart brand, and in 2012 we saw it launch the insane SLS AMG Electric Drive. On top of this, an electric B-Class has just been launched and Mercedes has said it was open to working more closely with Tesla, which it has a stake in.
