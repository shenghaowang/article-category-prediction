Starbucks has concocted yet another way to shake some spare change out of its mobile phone-carrying customers: digital tipping, according to USA TODAY.Beginning Wednesday, March 19, customers who use the Starbucks App for iPhone in the U.S., Canada and UK will be able to use the app to leave a tip at more than 7,000 company-operated Starbucks stores.Until now, consumers could not digitally tip at Starbucks. This has been a problem. Thousands of caffeine-seeking customers who carry their cell phones ¨C but no cash ¨C have been stiffing baristas, and not feeling so swell about it.
