King Digital Entertainment, owner of the world's most addictive video game, slapped a price range on its initial public offering Wednesday, and the bottom line was a lot lower than expected. The owner of Candy Crush Saga said it planned to sell 25.5 million shares at up to $24 each. With 315 million shares outstanding after the offering, that values the company at $7.6 billion. King brought in $1.9 billion of revenue and $568 million of profits last year. That's $1.80 per share in profit, or a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of a whopping 13.3.
