U.S. Navy SEALs took control of a North Korea-flagged tanker that had loaded crude oil at a port held by rebels in eastern Libya, the Pentagon said in a statement on Monday, Al Arabiya reported.

According to the Pentagon, the move was made at "request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments."

No one was hurt "when U.S. forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement, reported by Agence France-Presse.

The ship was boarded by the SEALs just after 0200 GMT Monday "in international waters southeast of Cyprus" following President Barack Obama approval of the operation.

The statement said the ship "is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government's National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra."

The Morning Glory, which departed from the eastern Libyan port of Al-Sidra -- controlled by rebels seeking autonomy from the authorities in Tripoli -- is reported to have loaded at least 234,000 barrels of crude, according to Agence France-Presse.

The ship was operated by an Egypt-based company that was allowed to temporarily use the North Korean flag under a contract with Pyongyang, North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.

Pyongyang had "cancelled and deleted" the ship's North Korean registry, as it violated its law "on the registry of ships and the contract that prohibited it from transporting contraband cargo."

"Therefore, the ship has nothing to do" with North Korea, which "has no responsibility whatsoever as regards the ship," KCNA said.
