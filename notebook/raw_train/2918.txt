As a former Starbucks employee, I want to start off by saying thank you for wanting to tip your baristas. While Starbucks pays above the retail average and takes great care of its employees with full benefits for part-time employees that average 20/hrs a week + annual stock grants, tips are definitely something the employees count upon for their livelihood. 



I'm assuming you're like me and don't tend to carry cash around with you. A "workaround" that I've done is to not worry about tipping on every transaction and do a bulk tip on a frequency of your comfort (IE every month). The only caveat is that this assumes you go to the same Starbucks every day. 



Let's assume you do go to the same Starbucks every time. Doing a bulk tip makes a bigger impression on the baristas working at the time. Tipping $1 a day for 30 days will at best get you a thank you each time. But tipping $30 at the end of the month all at once will really hit home with the barista and make you a VIP in their eyes. The power of numbers.
