A US congressional committee has said it is investigating General Motors' recall of nearly 1.6 million vehicles over faulty ignition switches.



The problem could turn off the engine in affected vehicles while they were being driven, disabling the airbags.



The carmaker announced the recall last month, but it has admitted employees knew about the defect as early as 2004.
