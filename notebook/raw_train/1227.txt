The state House of Representatives has unanimously approved a bill aimed at softening the impact of new federal flood insurance rules on many coastal homeowners.

The measure would tie the level of flood insurance that must be purchased to a homeowner¡¯s outstanding mortgage balance, rather than the full replacement value of the home. The bill now goes to the Senate.

The Federal Trade Commission opened a formal investigation into Herbalife¡¯s operations yesterday, pushing shares of the nutrition and weight loss company sharply lower.

Shares of Herbalife plunged as much as 15 percent after being temporarily halted but gradually recovered from lows, ending the day down 7.3 percent. Shares were up more than 4 percent prior to the halt. A circuit breaker also briefly halted trading in shares of rival Nu Skin due to volatility.
