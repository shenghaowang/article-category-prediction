About The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc.

~ Fourth Quarter Net Income of $3.04 Per Diluted Share ~ YORK, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:BONT) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 ended February 1, 2014. Results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 were impacted by the inclusion of an additional week in each period, resulting in a 14-week and 53-week reporting period, respectively, in accordance with the National Retail Federation fiscal reporting calendar. This compares with a reporting period ended February 1, 2014 of 13 weeks and 52 weeks in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013, respectively.Brendan Hoffman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Despite disappointing fourth quarter sales results, we continued to make progress on several strategic initiatives that we believe will drive improved performance. Multiple snowstorms and the polar vortex during the December and January periods resulted in a sharp decline in traffic and, therefore, we were unable to achieve our comparable store sales goals in the fourth quarter. In spite of these top line pressures, we were able to achieve a gross margin rate slightly better than prior year and reduce expenses. In addition, we effectively managed our inventory such that we ended the year with inventory levels approximately 5% below that of the prior year, including a significant reduction in carryover merchandise, leaving us well positioned for the spring season." Mr. Hoffman continued, "We have made great strides in executing our strategic initiatives and will continue to focus on enhancing our merchandise assortments, driving our eCommerce business, refining our marketing strategy and moving forward with our localization initiative, all with an eye on improving our productivity. We are excited about our new eCommerce fulfillment center, which will permit significant expansion of our shipping capacity with improved operational efficiency. We will continue strengthening our foundation to deliver profitable sales growth in the coming years."For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, total sales in the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2014 decreased 9.9% to $914.9 million, compared with $1,015.1 million in the 14-week period ended February 2, 2013.
