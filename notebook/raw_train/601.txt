The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act is Friday.

December 15th is your last day to enroll for any subsidized private coverage you or your family may need in 2018.

The Associated Press reports, as of early December, enrollment numbers were up by about 20 percent; however, health experts say it's unlikely enrollment numbers will end up matching those from 2017 because this year's enrollment period is half as long as it was under the Obama administration.
