Malaysia Airlines believes the co-pilot aboard the missing plane spoke the last words to ground controllers.

CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference on Monday that initial investigations indicate that co-pilot is the one who calmly said, "All right, good night."

Officials previously said that those words came at a point in the March 8 flight when one of the plane's data communications systems had already been switched off.

The timing of the last words has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance.

Malaysia's defence minister, meanwhile, said searches have begun in both the northern and southern corridors of a vast swath of Asia where the missing jet is believed to have ended up.

Hishammuddin Hussein said Kazakhstan joined the search in the farthest northwest section of the search area.

Earlier on Monday, Australia said it was taking the lead in searching over the southern Indian Ocean.
