Starting on March 26, Walmart starts taking on GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, and a number of other retailers with a video game trade-in program, the company confirms. You¡¯ll be able to sell off your old games at any of the more than 3,100 Walmart stores and receive a gift card for use online or in-store at any Walmart or Sam¡¯s Club. This also means that Walmart¡¯s getting into the used game sales business, with all re-sold discs sent off to be refurbished before being restocked on store shelves (or kept as inventory for online sales) at a lower price.

The program works just like others of this sort. You bring your game in its original packaging to the electronics department of one of the company¡¯s stores. A customer service rep will inspect each disc for cracks and other defects and tells you what it¡¯s all worth. Then you get your money, in the form of a gift card. Simple stuff.

The program builds on Walmart¡¯s existing trade-in program, that allows customers to sell off old smartphones and tablets. You can find more info on the newly expanded trade-in program on Walmart¡¯s official website.
