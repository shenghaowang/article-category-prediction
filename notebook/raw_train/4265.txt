Traders are positioning for a possible slide in American Eagle Outfitters. 



More than 7,000 November 12 puts traded in a heavy buying pattern yesterday, led by a print of 4,000 that went for the ask price of $0.25, according to optionMONSTER's Depth Charge tracking system. The volume was well above the previous open interest of 1,531 contracts, indicating that new positions were established.



These puts lock in the price where the stock can be sold no matter how far it might drop, gaining value in a selloff. They could have been purchased either as an outright bearish bet or a hedge on a long position , but either way they will expire worthless if shares remain above $12 through mid-November.

AEO fell 1.17 percent to $13.55 yesterday, closing just above its 50-day moving average. The retailer is now at the low end of a range that has been in place since its last earnings report in mid-August. The company has not announced the date of its next quarterly results, but they are expected to come out in early December.



Yesterday's total option volume in the name was more than triple its daily average for the last month. Overall puts outnumbered calls by 4.5 to 1, a reflection of the session's bearish sentiment.
