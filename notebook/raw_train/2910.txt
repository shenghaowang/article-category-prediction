Suit retailer Jos. A Bank has been struggling to dodge a hostile bid from rival Men's Wearhouse. The company's latest defense plan: Throw on some extra layers from Eddie Bauer.

Friday morning, Jos. A Bank surprised its suitor with a deal to purchase the casual and outdoor apparel retailer for about $825 million. The deal also also includes a partial share repurchase at $65 a share, well above the market price of $54 and the Men's Wearhouse offer of $57.50. The moves to bulk up and buy expensive shares both look designed to fend off Men's Warehouse.

But behind all the brinksmanship, the company is attempting to deliver on a recovery story with two brands that have both seen better days. If it is successful, the stock could be worth far than the offer from Men's Wearhouse. But that will require both the suits business and Eddie Bauer to get back on track in a hurry.
