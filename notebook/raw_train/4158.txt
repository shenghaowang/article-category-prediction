Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has unexpectedly deteriorated in the month of March, according to the preliminary results of a survey by the University of Michigan.

The report showed that the consumer sentiment index tumbled to 91.2 in March from the final February reading of 95.4.

The decrease came as a surprise to economists, who had expected the consumer sentiment index to inch up to a reading of 96.0.

Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, said a drop in consumer optimism was seen among lower and middle income households, while confidence improved among households with incomes in the top third.

"The renewed concerns expressed by lower and middle income households mainly involved income declines and higher utility costs as well as disruptions to shopping and businesses due to the harsh winter," Curtin said.

He added, "Among those with incomes in the top third, strong gains were concentrated in the near term outlook for the economy and buying plans."

The report said the current economic conditions index fell to 103.0 in March from 106.9 in February, while the while the index of consumer expectations slid to 83.7 from 88.0.

On the inflation front, one-year inflation expectations climbed to 3.0 percent in March from 2.8 percent in February. The five-year inflation outlook also edged up to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent.
