GameStop shares are being zapped on worries about Wal-Mart 's entry into the used-videogame market.

Early Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores (ticker: WMT) announced that on March 26 it would begin accepting used videogames from customers, who could then use the value of their trade-in for any purchases at the chain or at its Sam's Club stores. Wal-Mart will in turn refurbish the games and sell them in "like-new condition."

While Wal-Mart was flat in recent trading, GameStop (GME) shares fell 4.2% to $38.06 on the news. However, we think the market is underestimating GameStop's expertise and staying power.

Certainly, Wal-Mart's entering the fray is a near-term negative for GameStop, as it provides a new competitor and headline risk for the stock.

Yet this is not the first time that a bigger, deeper-pocketed retailer has tried and failed to thrive in the used-videogame market. As Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Arvind Bhatia notes, companies from Best Buy (BBY) to Target (TGT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have tried to move in on GameStop's business.

"Some of them have made multiple attempts over the years, including Best Buy, which we recall has attempted it at least on four different occasions in the last console cycle. None of the retailers so far has had much success. It makes sense and feels natural that various retailers that offer new video games would try to offer trade-ins as well. However, as many retailers have discovered in the past, buying product from merchants in bulk is quite different than buying 1 disc at a time from customers," notes Bhatia.

Bhatia argues that GameStop has "many inherent competitive advantages as the expert in video games" that make it difficult for others to steal its business: The company has a dedicated refurbishing center, an algorithm for pricing perfected over the past decade, and a customer loyalty program.

Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson is another bull, who advises buying the stock on Tuesday's weakness, as he thinks Wal-Mart's impact will be "immaterial" to GameStop's used-videogame business. He notes that Wal-Mart will be at a disadvantage to GameStop because "GameStop typically offers both cash and store credit (Wal-Mart offering only store credit); GameStop accepts both video game hardware and software, which gamers often trade-in together (Wal-Mart accepts only software) [and] GameStop is a destination for gamers (Wal-Mart sells video game hardware and software, but this is a small sub-segment of their business)."

And while GameStop may not be close in size to the world's largest retailer, it is a healthy company with dominant market share. It's debt free, with about $5 per share of cash on its balance sheet, which it has used to boost its generous 3.4% yield and buy back shares.

Early this year, Barron's recommended GameStop shares, arguing that investors were overreacting to the company's weak holiday sales. (See Follow Up, "GameStop Has 50% Upside," Jan. 18). The shares are up 1.6% since that article's publication, just edging ahead of the Standard & Poor's 500's return during the same period.

Even skeptics note that GameStop isn't resting on its laurels. S&P Capital IQ analyst Efraim Levy, who downgraded the stock to Hold on the news, notes that "GameStop is already adjusting to increasing its focus on sales of digital content and for mobile devices."

Levy's new price target assumes a valuation of 11 times 2015 earnings, but with today's dip the shares are already trading at just over 10 times.

So it's too soon to count out GameStop.
