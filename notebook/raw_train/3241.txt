Do baristas know if you tipped them over the app?

Before i used the app, i used to tip quite often in the little jar and always received friendly service. I just might be imagining things, but ever since switching to the app and hitting the tip button on there, i'm not getting the same friendly faces.

So, do you know while i'm in the store if i tipped you or not?

Am i going to have to do this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svWjtDhGQFg
