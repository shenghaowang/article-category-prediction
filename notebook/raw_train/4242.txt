MOSCOW ¡ª Russian President Vladimir Putin ratcheted up a confrontation with Ukraine on Wednesday, blaming Kiev for the deaths of two service members in Crimea in recent days and saying Russia wouldn¡¯t ignore them.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the claim ¡°absurd and cynical,¡± saying it was ¡°a pretext for the latest military threats against Ukraine.¡± Poroshenko said that Ukraine would use only political and diplomatic means to return Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in March 2014.

The dispute comes amid a spike in violence last month in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is supporting separatists through covert military interventions. Russia has denied aiding the pro-Russian separatists.

A cease-fire agreed in February 2015 tempered fighting that has lasted more than two years and killed nearly 10,000 people, according to the United Nations. But talks on a long-term resolution to the conflict have dragged on, and clashes have continued at several hot spots along the front lines.

¡°I think it¡¯s obvious to everyone that the current Kiev government isn¡¯t seeking ways to resolve problems through negotiations, but is switching to terror. It¡¯s a very worrying thing,¡± Putin said at a press conference in Moscow after meeting Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan.

¡°There are losses on the Russian side,¡± Putin said. ¡°Two service members have been killed. Certainly, we won¡¯t ignore such things.¡±
