Factions of Libya's government voted to oust current Prime Minister Ali Zeidan after his leadership failed to stop eastern rebels from independently exporting oil abroad, according to Reuters and Agence France Presse.

"The parliamentary factions are meeting. There is a consensus on bringing down the government. We are going to put it to the vote shortly. The situation in the country has become unacceptable. Even those MPs who used to support the prime minister no longer have any alternative," MP Suad Gannur told AFP.

According to Al Arabiya News, Zeidan will be replaced temporarily by the defense minister.

Zeidan's government has received extensive criticism from both the parliament and the public for its failure to calm chaos and control rebel militias throughout the restive North African country since taking office after the oust of former dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The latest showcase of his leadership failure was the ability for eastern rebel groups to use a ship called The Morning Glory to independently export at least 234,000 barrels of crude. The vessel managed to escape to sea from Al Sidra earlier Tuesday even after Zeidan's government threatened arm action and air strikes to keep the tanker from reaching international waters.

Zeidan, who was also previously abducted himself by rebel militias, has faced motions in parliament to resign in previous months. However, the General National Congress did not achieve the statutory quorum of 120 of its 194 members in the pass to implement the motion accordingly.
