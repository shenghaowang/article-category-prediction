Sentiment was once again driven by uncertainty over trade policy, and while major indexes opened higher, they turned negative in midday trading, with selling accelerating throughout the session and major indexes closing at their lowest levels of the month.

The information technology sector dropped 1.5% while consumer-discretional stocks ended down 1.3%, pressured by losses in both Amazon.com and Netflix Inc.

The financial sector fell 1.3% in its 13th straight daily decline, extending what had already been the longest losing streak in its history.
