Market players on Monday said that Vodafone¡¯s 7.2bn acquisition of Spanish cable operator Ono would likely be credit positive for both, and could even lead to rating upgrades for the latter.

Several sources said that Ono, rated B1/B+ by Moody¡¯s and S&P, would likely benefit from greater market access thanks to consolidation in its home market, giving it the chance to even challenge players like Telefonica.

¡°I think it is very likely that Ono will be upgraded on the back of this,¡± one London-based investor said, echoing a note published by Fitch back in January that said an acquisition of Ono by Vodafone ¨C or even Liberty Global ¨C would skew competition in Ono¡¯s favour.

Others pointed to Vodafone¡¯s acquisition of Kabel Deutschland in October last year, which saw KD¡¯s ratings upped to Baa2/BBB+ from Ba2/BB. Vodafone is currently A3/A-.

By mid-morning, though, neither Vodafone¡¯s nor Ono¡¯s credit curves had moved significantly, with market players saying that the news had likely been priced in following months of rumours.

Vodafone¡¯s senior curve was basically unchanged, bid between 0.6bp tighter and 0.4bp wider, according to Tradeweb, while its CDS was also flat at 60bp.

Sources said that Ono¡¯s bonds were unmoved too. Shares in Vodafone were quoted around 1% higher. Ono is not listed.

The acquisition will mark Vodafone¡¯s third purchase of a European fixed-broadband asset in two years, allowing it to offer an increasing range of services and offload some of its mobile traffic on to Ono¡¯s cable network, Reuters said.

The deal will be funded using the proceeds of Vodafone¡¯s USD130bn sale of Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications agreed last year.

The 7.2bn price tag implies a multiple of 10.4 times the target¡¯s operating free cash flow, broadly in line with recent deals in the European cable and telecoms sector.
