Walmart is taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.

Here's part of the announcement Walmart made this morning:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, the more than 110 million gamers across the country will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam's Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition starting this summer. This is a new category for us and something our customers have been asking for.

Ultimately, when Walmart disrupts markets and competes, our customer wins.
