The Bon-Ton Stores on Tuesday reported a 17.6 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profits but a smaller net loss for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1.

The York-based chain also announced that Brendan L. Hoffman, president and chief executive officer, will step down when his employment agreement expires in February 2015.

Hoffman, who was hired from Lord & Taylor in February 2012, said the decision was due to ¡°strictly personal reasons.¡±

For the quarter, net profits were $61.3 million ($3.04 a share), down from $74.4 million ($3.71 a share) in the 2012 quarter. Sales decreased 9.9 percent to $914.9 million.

Though The Bon-Ton cut interest expense and selling, general and administrative expense, the quarter¡¯s bottom line was hurt by bad weather that restricted sales.

For the year, the net loss was $3.6 million (19 cents a share), compared to a loss of $21.6 million ($1.16 a share) in fiscal 2012. Sales fell 5.1 percent to $2.77 billion.
