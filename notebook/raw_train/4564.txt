After many rumors and even a brief trial program, Walmart is finally following Best Buy, Amazon and, of course, GameStop in taking trade-ins of used games. It will start accepting your old games on March 26th, in exchange for store credit usable at Walmart and Sam's Club, whether in-store or online. Once it has the games they'll be refurbished and then this summer, go on sale for "a great low price." It's all very familiar if you've ever traded a game in before, but Walmart says it will "pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want." Your move, GameStop.
