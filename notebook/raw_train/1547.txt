General Motors is at the center of a criminal investigation.

In February, the automaker recalled more than 1.5 million vehicles for a faulty ignition switch linked to 13 deaths.

Vehicles on the GM recall list include 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006 and 2007 Chevy HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky, 2005-2007 Chevy Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5S.

The company first learned of the problem a decade earlier.

When CBS News aired its first investigative report into the problem, Vicki Harrington said she was scared. Two teenage girls were killed when a Chevrolet Cobalt went off the road in 2006. For Harrington, a mother from West Des Moines, the similarities between the crash and her daughter¡¯s vehicle were startling.

¡°It was a 2005 Cobalt that they were driving, and hers is a 2006,¡± she said.

Her daughter, Katie, has been driving a Chevy Cobalt for about six years. A few weeks ago she attempted to get its ignition fixed at an authorized GM dealership. However, the dealership told her its hands were tied and offered no solutions.

GM is offering free loaner vehicles while it waits for parts to arrive for repairs or $500 toward the purchase of a new car.

GM dealerships across the metro would not respond to requests for comment on how many drivers the recall affected.

¡°Sometimes they don¡¯t think it¡¯s significant enough or it¡¯s not enough vehicles having the problem,¡± said local mechanic John Merriam.

A faulty ignition switch can cause the engine to shut down and disable airbags.

GM indicated Wednesday that it knows of 31 crashes and 13 deaths that resulted from recalled vehicles, leaving Harrington looking elsewhere for her daughter¡¯s next car.

¡°The way they¡¯ve handled this whole situation has just been completely unacceptable,¡± Harrington said.
