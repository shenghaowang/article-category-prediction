Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has said "we will not give up on any suspected clue that has been found" as the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 continues.

Three satellite images have been released on a Chinese government website.

They show what appear to be large, floating objects in the South China Sea. Previous sightings of possible debris have proved fruitless.
