Stocks came under pressure at the start of trading on Wednesday, extending the pullback seen over the two previous sessions. The major averages showed notable moves to the downside, although selling pressure has waned since the open.

Considerable weakness overseas is weighing on Wall Street, with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day.

Concerns about economic growth in China and the situation in Ukraine have also generated some negative sentiment, although activity seems somewhat subdued amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.

Nonetheless, brokerage stocks have shown another notable move to the downside, with the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index falling by 1.2 percent. The index is pulling back further off last Friday's nearly six-year closing high.

Significant weakness has also emerged among housing stocks, as reflected by the 1.1 percent loss being posted by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. With the drop, the index has fallen to its lowest intraday level in a month.

Tobacco, telecom, and chemical stocks are also seeing early weakness, while gold stocks are moving sharply higher amid a jump by the price of the precious metal.

The major averages have climbed off their worst levels in recent trading but currently remain stuck in the red. The Dow is down 50.67 points or 0.3 percent at 16,300.58, the Nasdaq is down 18.33 points or 0.4 percent at 4,288.85 and he S&P 500 is down 7.72 points or 0.4 percent at 1,859.91.
