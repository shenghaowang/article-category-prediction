If Airbnb manages to raise between $400 and $500 million, it will make them one of the most valuable startups in the world. In hits last fundraising round, Airbnb raised cash based on a $2.5 billion valuation.

There has been a lot buzz generated among technology companies, especially startups, following the $19 billion purchase of messaging app WhatsApp by Facebook. Facebook itself was one of the most popular startups in the technology segment, now valued at around $72 billion.

Airbnb helps connect travelers with people interested in renting out their homes or even a room for a fee, with the company collecting a portion of the fee. The company is also under scrutiny from regulators who are looking at whether the company's services is depriving states of taxes.
