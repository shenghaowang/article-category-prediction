CNBC published this story earlier about what has changed since Donald Trump has been president. Take a look at the article here: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/20/chart-shows-how-everything-has-changed-since-trump-became-president.html?&qsearchterm=trump. What has the stock market done since Trump took office (not elected 每 took office 每 you can＊t do anything as the President-elect)? Why is this important? Because it shows how and if the policies enacted have and will be effective in boosting the economy and thus the market. Why do I care about the market primarily? Because that is what I do 每 that is what I trade. I am very glad for the millions more employed and higher wages, but what has the market done, and where is it telling me the economy is going? Hmmm. Before I get hate mail 每 I know that the market and interest rate positions were very different. Here are some points for and against each. First 每 obviously, President Obama＊s presidency started in a rut. However, it is important to note that the from the time that President Obama got elected to the bottom of the market in March (of roughly 666 on the S&P 500), the market dropped a solid 20%.
