US STOCKS-Wall St extends recent fall but ends well off day's lows

U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday after worries about the earnings outlook added to recent selling pressure, though major indexes ended well off the day's lows as investors snapped up beaten-down shares late in the session. Shares of Caterpillar tumbled 7.6 percent after the heavy-equipment maker maintained its 2018 earnings forecast, following forecast increases in the previous two quarters. The S&P 500 energy index fell 2.7 percent, the most of any sector, as oil prices plunged after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed.
