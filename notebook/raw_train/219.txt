Sandwich chain Quiznos Corp. filed for pre-packaged bankruptcy protection on Friday after struggling with high debt and stiff competition for years.

The Denver-based chain, known for pioneering the concept of toasted subs, said the restructuring would cut its debt by more than $400 million.

All except seven of its nearly 2,100 restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees and will not be affected by the bankruptcy, the company said in a statement.
