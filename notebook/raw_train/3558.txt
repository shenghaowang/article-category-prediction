McDonald¡¯s (NYSE:MCD) said Monday its global same-store sales were down 0.3% in February, as weak results in the U.S. and Japan offset growth in Europe.

The fast-food chain reported a 0.6% decline in systemwide sales, which rose 2.2% excluding currency fluctuations.

U.S. same-store sales, which includes restaurants open at least 13 months, fell 1.4% amid ¡°challenging industry dynamics¡± and harsh weather this winter, the company said.

Strong results in the U.K. helped the European segment post 0.6% growth in comparable store sales. France also booked positive sales last month.

Same-store sales in McDonald¡¯s Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region were 2.6% lower, largely due to declines in Japan. The Oakbrook, Ill.-based company said it will look to improve menu variety, among other moves, to improve the segment¡¯s results.
