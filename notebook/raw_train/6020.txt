Bruno Guillon has stepped down as chief executive of luxury handbag maker Mulberry ( ) with immediate effect.

Guillon has led the AIM-listed company since March 2012 when he took over from Godfrey Davis, who then became non-executive chairman.

Davis will take up the role of executive chairman until a successor is found.

It follows falling sales and a profit warning at the end of January.

British shoppers crossed Alexa satchels off their Christmas wish lists despite heavy discounts, while Korea is also proving a more difficult market to crack than expected.

¡°I, along with the Board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years,¡± said Davis.

¡°He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.

¡°I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.¡±
