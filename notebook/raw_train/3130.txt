A Delta Air Lines plane lost a wing panel Sunday during a flight from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta, according to news reports.

Delta spokesman Anthony Black told NBC News that the missing panel, which fell off in mid-air on Flight 2412, did not affect the plane's "ability to fly or land."

Crew members declared an emergency, but the plane landed safely and no one was hurt, according to ABC News.

Officials are examining the plane to see what went wrong.
