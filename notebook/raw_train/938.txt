United States stocks closed sharply lower, retreating from last week's records as investors paused to assess recent US economic data while shrugging off uncertainties surrounding Ukraine.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 67.43 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 16,351.25. 



The S&P 500 index eased 9.54 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 1,867.63 while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 27.26, or 0.63 per cent, to 4,307.19. 



The S&P 500 has gained 0.8 per cent so far in March, after running up 4.3 per cent in February, and is hovering around Friday's record closing high of 1878.04. Meanwhile, the Dow was 1.1 per cent away from its December 31 record high of 16576.66.

William Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates, said investors saw little reason to make big bets either way given the session's dearth of major economic reports.

"Investors really don't have a handle on whether or not this economy is getting stronger or weaker and how that might affect first-quarter earnings," Mr Lynch said.

Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, said the market drifted lower in the absence of a catalyst to lift stocks and overtake "psychological resistance" to new records.
