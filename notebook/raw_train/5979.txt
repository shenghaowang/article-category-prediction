Where do you live? silagra youtube I think investing in a restaurant is much more of a lifestyle type of decision. Weve invested in half a dozen restaurants, maybe more. Maybe close to a dozen restaurants and on the portfolio of investments weve made we will get our money back. But thats not why were investing in the restaurant. Were investing in the restaurant because we believe in the chef or we believe in the operator or theyre opening in our neighborhood and we want them to open in our neighborhood and we will be great customers. Its a lifestyle investment. The founders of Kickstarter always say Kickstarter is so people can help make the things they want to see in the world exist. Its an example of that. It would be irrational of us to do it if we knew we were going to lose money but if we do it across a diversified portfolio of investments and weve gotten our money back on a few already, and were close to getting our money back on a few others, so I have a fairly high degree of confidence that on the bucket of them well get our money back but the financial returns are not going to be the same as the venture business. There are other kinds of returns, karmic returns or whatever you want to call them, that are quite substantial.
