Three Reasons I Still Love Amazon Prime for $99 a Year

People have been wigging out in the media and on Facebook about the upcoming increase for Amazon Prime from $79 to $99 per year. Personally, I think the revised price is still a great deal.

I joined Amazon Prime back on September 04, 2007. At the time, the price was $79 a year and the benefit was free two-day shipping on many products.

The shipping was worth it to me, since I regularly gift a lot of books to people, and not having to pay shipping makes a substantial difference.

And then they added on the perks of free movies and TV episodes, as well as borrowing books.

Currently, you can stream of 40,000 movies & TV episodes, and there are ovver 500,000 Kindle titles to borrow for free. Just today, I watched one of my favorites, Glengarry Glen Ross, on there, and I¡¯m checking out the 30,000+ business titles that are freely available.

Realistically, I would have paid 2x or 3x the price for what I get, so a $20 increase kicking in later this year (the first increase in the 7 years I¡¯ve been using it) isn¡¯t so bad.

If you are not currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, you can still pay the $79 rate for the first year, and they have a 30 day free trial.
