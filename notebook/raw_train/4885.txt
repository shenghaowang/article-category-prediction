(KNWA) "Walmart To Go" is the latest store model creation from the worlds largest retailer.

The first gas station/small market hybrid opened earlier this week in Bentonville, Arkansas.

"It is very much a hybrid. I would consider it a food store that sells fuel," Debra Layton, Senior Vice President of Small Formats for Walmart said.

It has gas and snacks like the typical convenience store, along with quick order meals and groceries.
