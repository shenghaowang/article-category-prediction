U.S. investigators think the missing Malaysia Airlines plane most likely flew southwest over the Indian Ocean off Western Australia, Bloomberg reports citing two officials.

Satellite data showed that the plane likely flew either on that route or northwest toward Kazakhstan. The latter seems less likely since the plane would have flown through the airspace of multiple countries.

Experts agree that there¡¯s a good chance MH370 will never be found if it¡¯s gone into a deep and remote part of the Indian Ocean.

Australia today took charge of the search in the Indian Ocean.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament Australia would coordinate operations in the vast search area to its west.

Mr Abbott spoke to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak today. ¡°I offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted,¡± he said.

Defence Force chief General David Hurley had been in touch with his Malaysian counterpart to discuss how additional resources could be used.

Australia has two P-3 Orion surveillance planes on the search and are reportedly looking around the Cocos islands about 2,000 nautical miles northwest of Perth.

Mr Abbott said: ¡°We will do our duty to ensure that our search and rescue responsibilities are maintained and upheld and we will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery.¡±
