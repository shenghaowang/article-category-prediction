Starting next week, you can take your old video games to Wal-Mart and get store credit for them. According to Carl Howe, Vice President of Research at the Yankee Group, it's a smart move for the superstore.

"I think what the retailers have found is that there¡¯s a very robust secondary market for games. They¡¯re expensive enough and the demographic that buys games is young enough that they¡¯re pretty cost sensitive."

The used game market in the US is worth more than $1.5 billion, which is not great news for game publishers. Companies like GameStop and Best Buy, however, have deep roots in the used game market.

Wal-Mart does have size on its side. Its hired an outside company to handle refurbishment of the old games that come in, and plans to start selling them at Wal-marts by the end of the year.
