ObamaCare, the president's signature domestic policy achievement, turns four at the end of the week. But after so many missed deadlines, delays and unilateral changes to the new law the American people have more cause for confusion than celebration.

Here's a quick look at the growing list of shifts in deadlines and major adjustments to key parts of the law that have left consumers, job creators, and insurance companies, alike, wondering what's actually working with ObamaCare:

"[In 2013] the president has quietly delayed, modified, or selectively enforced elements of Obamacare more than a dozen times." (Obamacare's Year of Delayed Deadlines, , )

"...the Administration quietly excused millions of people from the requirement to purchase health insurance or else pay a tax penalty." (ObamaCare's Secret Mandate Exemption, , )

"Delays in Obamacare's most destructive requirements are so common -- and so obviously motivated by political considerations -- they aren't even newsworthy anymore." (Another ObamaCare Delay, Las Vegas Review -Journal, )

"...a flurry of changes by the Obama administration has led to a frenzied effort among employers, insurance companies, politicians and consumers to try and understand what they might mean." (Slew of changes to health-care law creates more confusion for consumers, , )

"...more than 37 significant changes already have been made to ObamaCare: at least 20 that has made unilaterally..." (37 Changes to ObamaCare... , , )

" announced it would postpone enforcement of a federal requirement for medium-size employers to provide health insurance to employees..." (Further Delays for Employers in Health Law, , )

"The Obama administration has decided that the sequester's mandatory spending cuts no longer apply to part of Obamacare." ( : Sequester No Longer Applies to Part of Obamacare, , )
