Malaysia flight MH370: New images of 'possible debris'

French satellite images show potential debris in vicinity of search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, minister says, reports CNN.

Malaysia ministry of transport says it has received new satellite images from France showing potential debris from missing flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean, reports BBC.

This is the third set of images in a week of possible debris in the area.

Australia is coordinating the search and earlier said it was investigating sightings of a pallet and other items.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on 8 March en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 people on board.

Malaysian officials believe the plane was deliberately taken off course.

Based on information received from a satellite, the search has been in two distinct corridors - one stretching to the north-west of the last known location in the Malacca Straits and one to the south-west.

However, none of the countries on the northern corridor have reported any radar contact, and the satellite images of possible debris in the south Indian Ocean have concentrated the search there.

A statement published on the Malaysian ministry of transport's Facebook page said: "This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor.

"Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination centre."

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa), which is overseeing the search, said eight planes were sent out from Perth in western Australia on Sunday over a wider search area.

They included four civil aircraft and a US P8 Poseidon.

Two Chinese IL-76 search planes have arrived in Perth but have not yet been deployed. Japan is sending two P3 Orions.
