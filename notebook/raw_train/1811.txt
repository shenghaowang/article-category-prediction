 Take note of the fact that central bankers are talking a lot lately about the impact of ¡°persistent headwinds¡± against the economy. They are making an argument that is central to view that they should keep interest rates unusually low even after they start rising from near zero.

New York Fed president William Dudley said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this month that ¡°persistent headwinds¡± to growth explained why the economy would be unable to bear much higher interest rates in the years ahead.
