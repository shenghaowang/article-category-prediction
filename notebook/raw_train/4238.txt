Via Reuters: The doubling of the yuan trading band is aggravating concerns among foreign executives and investors about their exposure to China in the near term points to much greater downside risk "The foreign investors who we spoke with before this announcement were already becoming cautious," said Brian Ingram, chief investment officer at Ping An Russell Investment Management in Shanghai. "I think this announcement adds to the short-term or near-term bear case for those investors." Via the Wall Street Journal (may be gated): ¡°The currency could overshoot on the weak side for a while,¡± said Liu Li-Gang, an economist at ANZ. ¡°The PBOC¡¯s intention was to penalize speculators, and it will work.¡± But, not everyone agrees (Wall Street Journal again): ¡°I see plenty of structural drivers pointing to strengthening,¡± said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS, pointing to China¡¯s persistent trade surplus and investment inflows. - In the longer-term the move to greater financial market liberalization is a positive for China, but there may be continued short-term turmoil in the yuan. I reckon a lot of it has happened already over the past weeks leading up to the announcement, though.
