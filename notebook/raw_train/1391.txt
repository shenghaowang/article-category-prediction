More than 5 million people have signed up for health care plans under the newly created Obamacare insurance exchanges, according to a Monday press release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

According to the release, ¡°the last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone ¡ª the busiest day since December 23 ¡ª and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend.¡±

The 5 million figure comes on March 17, meaning that there have been roughly 800,000 enrollments in the last 17 days. That¡¯s a pace of 50,000 or so enrollments a day, which would put the administration on pace to hit 5.7 million by the end of the month.
