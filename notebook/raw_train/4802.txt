Istanbul: Turkey on Friday blocked access to Twitter nine days before local elections, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan acted on his vow to shut down leaks targeting his government amid a corruption probe.

The move was criticised both within Turkey and overseas, as users accessed Twitter via proxies and other work-arounds. President Abdullah Gul was one of them, posting to his Twitter account that the total ban of a social media platform "can't be condoned" and that he hoped it wouldn't last.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called Erdogan's ban a "groundless, pointless, cowardly" act of censorship. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the premier is "waging a campaign against all the media and press that he cannot directly influence or control."

The shutdown began hours after Erdogan said San Francisco-based Twitter had ignored court orders to remove content related to the graft investigation. He's also threatened to block Facebook and YouTube, where users have shared material including videos, recordings and transcripts that were first leaked via Twitter. Some of them are tied to a police investigation of government corruption which has cost four cabinet ministers their jobs and roiled markets.

It has been estimated that there are 10 million Twitter users in Turkey.
