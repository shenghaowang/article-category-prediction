Speaking before parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, Carney said the amount of spare capacity in the economy was probably slightly higher than 1.5% of gross domestic product, indicating that the economic recovery can continue without pushing up inflation.

He added that there was a range of views among the bank's monetary policy committee members on the amount of spare capacity in the economy.

Carney also reiterated that when rate increases do come they will be gradual.

Earlier Tuesday, data showed that U.K. manufacturing output rose more than expected in January, but bad weather hampered the broader measure of industrial output.
