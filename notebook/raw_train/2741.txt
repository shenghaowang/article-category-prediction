Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox has been dysfunctional, bankrupt and shrouded with a veil of mystery for weeks. The site's owners said in February 744,408 bitcoins were stolen due to a glitch in the Bitcoin protocol and took the site down, but updates were scarce since then.

Now, unidentified hackers claim they have data, including database dumps, that proves Mt. Gox's owners actually kept the bitcoins for themselves.

According to a report by Forbes, Hackers claim to have stolen the data from Mt. Gox's servers; they also took control of CEO Mark Karpeles' Reddit account and personal blog.

"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," hackers wrote, claiming no user database dumps have been included.

The data comprises of a spreadsheet of more than a million trades on Mt. Gox as well as a 716MB file that appears to show Mt. Gox's balance in 18 currencies, including bitcoin. The file points to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox, with a note saying "That fat f*ck has been lying." At the current exchange rate on bitcoin exchange BTC-e.com, that amount of bitcoins is worth approximately $595 million.

Early reports on Reddit claim the database file is genuine, but it's hard to confirm anything at this point, especially since many of the related posts on Reddit have been deleted.

Mt.Gox did not directly respond to the incident, but it did put a warning notice over the weekend, claiming that phishing emails impersonating Mt.Gox were being sent to users and warning them not to respond to these emails.
