Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says China and the United States should focus on their common interests in order to further enhance their relations.



Mr. Li said Thursday that countries working together will have differences, but can grow their ties through respectful actions.







"It's a fact that some friction exists in the course of cooperation, but this is the trouble with cooperation. As long as we respect each other, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, control well our differences, have equal consultations, and especially pay particular attention to expanding our common interests, then we will be able to enhance the level of China-U.S. bilateral relations."







Mr. Li's comments came after the closing of China's National People's Congress.



The NPC is made up of nearly 3,000 handpicked delegates from provinces and regions across China, who meet every year in order to formally approve policies handed down by the ruling Communist Party.



The U.S. and China are the world's largest economies and conduct $520 billion in annual trade.
