LOS ANGELES ¨C Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer announced a federal lawsuit today against cable provider Time Warner, alleging the company owes the city almost $10 million in franchise fees for the years 2008-11.

Time Warner, which makes billions of dollars in the Los Angeles market, is ¡°stiffing¡± the city by not turning over the funds in 2011, ¡°precisely when we needed it the most, when we were confronting the peak of the recession,¡± Feuer said.

The fees would have funded police officers and sidewalk repairs, he said.

¡°As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the city of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen in the city of Los Angeles,¡± according to a company statement. ¡°We are disappointed the city has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit. It will now be resolved through the legal process.¡±

According to the city attorney¡¯s office, Time Warner is required to pay the city a franchise fee to install cable wires and boxes under city streets, on telephone poles and elsewhere in the ¡°public-right-of-way.¡±

The cable provider was also required until 2009 to pay a fee toward providing public, governmental and education television programming, including allowing the public use of its studios, Feuer said.

Time Warner has refused to pay $9.7 million in franchise and other fees owed from 2008 until 2011, despite attempts to resolve the dispute ¡°amicably,¡± Feuer said.

¡°We¡¯re filing litigation not as a first resort, but as a last resort,¡± he said.
