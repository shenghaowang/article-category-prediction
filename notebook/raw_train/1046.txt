Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer¡¯s Investment Research says today¡¯s selling is not entirely due to the emerging market selloffs.

Emerging markets have been underperforming for a while now, and since October of last year have been on the downtrend. What we are seeing right now is a mild panic selloff triggered by fears over emerging markets. This is clear if you look at indiscriminate selling across sectors in the S&P 500.

But other factors are playing a role as well. For example, markets have rallied too far too fast last year and are overextended.

While earnings have not been too terrible, they have not been too great either.

This consolidation is still mild given the record levels we¡¯ve reached only a few weeks ago.
