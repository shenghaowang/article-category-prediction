Candy Crush was the most downloaded free app of 2013 with 500 million downloads since its launch [GETTY]

It will have a potential market value of 4.6billion, smashing earlier forecasts of 3billion, when it lists later this year, offering 22.2 million shares at between 12.60 and 14 each.

Co-founder and chief executive Riccardo Zacconi stands to make up to 448million from the float.

Candy Crush was the most downloaded free mobile app of 2013 and has been downloaded 500 million times since its 2012 launch. In 2011 King¡¯s sales were 39million but had surged to 1.1billion by 2013. King is also profitable.

Yet none of King¡¯s 180 games are as popular as Candy Crush and 95 per cent of revenues are generated by just three games.

Some analysts are therefore concerned that King is reliant on too small a selection of games.

In 2011, rival Zynga floated on the back of its hugely successful Farmville app but its value fell as it struggled to produce a similar scale hit.

King is backed by UK private equity firms Index Ventures and Apax.
