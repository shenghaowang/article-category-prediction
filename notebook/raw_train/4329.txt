For the many eligible individuals who have yet to enroll for healthcare coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, it¡¯s likely that there are questions about what to do. As the March 31 enrollment deadline approaches, it is important that to learn all about the options, so those interested are able to make an informed decision in choosing the insurance plan that best meets their needs.

To help with questions, Mile Bluff sent two employees to undergo specialized training to become Certified Application Counselors. Sue Gunderson and Carol Thomas are available to help people understand and navigate the ¡®exchange,¡¯ so they are able to enroll in time, and get the coverage that is ideal for them.

¡°It is natural to want to choose a plan that has the least-expensive premiums. We help people understand that this might not always be their best option for saving money over the course of an entire year,¡± Sue said. ¡°Asking questions is the key. I¡¯ve unfortunately seen individuals choose a plan based on up-front costs, only to find that by doing so, they were forced to see a new doctor in a different medical system.¡±

¡°As a Certified Application Counselor, I encourage individuals to think about what matters most to them, so they can choose a plan that best fits their specific needs and desires,¡± Carol explained. ¡°For some, staying with their doctor is the top priority; for others it might be prescription costs, and others yet might care most about what their co-pay and deductibles will be. Whatever the priority is, being informed is the best way to ensure that you are happy with the plan you do choose.¡±
