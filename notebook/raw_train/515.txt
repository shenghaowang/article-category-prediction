Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has begun its initial public offering process in the United States.

Alibaba's IPO is expected to be one of the largest ever in New York.

The announcement came on Sunday after Alibaba decided on New York after ruling out Hong Kong and London for the IPO.

Alibaba is expected to raise about 15-billion US dollars in what is being touted as the highest profile listing since Facebook's 16-billion dollar listing in 2012.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting Alibaba could launch its IPO as soon as April, which could allow trading to begin by the third quarter.
