Scarcely a week after revealing that the number of Amazon Prime members worldwide has surpassed 100 million, Amazon announced Thursday it will hike the membership¡¯s price to $119 per year from $99, a 20 percent jump.

The increase was announced during the Seattle e-commerce giant¡¯s quarterly earnings call. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky cited rising costs of Prime services, which include free, fast shipping and video streaming, CNN reported.

The price increase goes into effect for new members May 11, and will apply to Prime renewals starting June 16, according to CNN.

Amazon launched Prime in 2005, charging $79 a year for each membership. The company led by CEO Jeff Bezos upped the price to $99 in 2014.

In many states, including California, Prime memberships are subject to the state sales tax, and will cost more.

Amazon¡¯s profit for the first quarter of this year more than doubled from the same period last year, to $1.63 billion, the firm reported Thursday.
