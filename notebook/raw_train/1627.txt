The Affordable Care Act enables primary health care, which in turn promotes education about healthy lifestyle choices. George F. Will¡¯s March 13 op-ed column, ¡°Government health action that works,¡± argued that healthy lifestyle choices and changes have more impact and are less risky than preventive medication. I¡¯m not sure if he meant to advocate for a basic premise of Obamacare, but thanks!
