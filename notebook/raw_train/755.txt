In Macon next year, 13 plans will be available, all from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. A 50-year-old woman with income of $30,000 will be eligible for a subsidy of $597 a month. That subsidy would lower her premium to an average of $236 a month for silver plans and $77 a month for bronze plans, according to HealthCare.gov.

But for a 50-year-old woman in Macon with annual income of $50,000, costs would be much higher. She would not be eligible for financial assistance and would have to pay $768 a month ¡ª more than 18 percent of her income ¡ª for the cheapest silver plan. Prices in rural southwest Georgia and a few other parts of the state will be even higher, although in Atlanta they will be lower.

For Pat and John Curry of Augusta, who are both 57 and own a small coffee-roasting business, options will range next year from a bronze plan for $1,526 a month with a $13,500 family deductible to a gold plan for $3,142 a month and a $3,900 family deductible. Blue Cross is the only insurer selling in their county. The couple, who each have chronic conditions and take multiple daily medications, said they would research whether buying a plan directly from Blue Cross would be cheaper.

Ms. Curry will also consider buying coverage only for her husband, who is getting follow-up care for cancer.

¡°I don¡¯t know what we¡¯ll be doing for insurance,¡± Ms. Curry said, looking at rates under the Affordable Care Act, ¡°but it won¡¯t be this.¡±
