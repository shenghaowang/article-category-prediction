Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, described as a mix of EBay, Amazon and Paypal is preparing to launch what may be the biggest share market listing of a Chinese company in the United States.

Alibaba is gearing up, for an initial public offering, probably sometime this week, in a move that could raise $US15 billion, just shy of what Facebook hit when it went public.

And the sentiment for Chinese companies is looking good - shares of Weibo, China's version of Twitter, soared on debut last week.
