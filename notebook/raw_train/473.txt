LONDON: Gold hit a near six-month high on Wednesday, as fears of more corporate defaults in China and the geopolitical tug-of-war between Russia, Ukraine and the West hurt equity markets, boosting the metal's appeal as an insurance against risk.

Spot gold rose as much as 1.4 per cent to its highest since Sept. 19 at $1,368.40 an ounce in earlier trading and was up 1.2pc at $1,365.50 an ounce by 1457 GMT.

US gold futures also rose to a near six-month high of $1,369.00 an ounce, before trading at $1,365.70, up 1.4pc.

In China, the world's biggest gold consumer, local prices are at a discount to spot prices of about $3 an ounce. Demand has waned since the Lunar New Year holiday, before which prices were at a premium of $20. In other precious metals, silver gained 1.2pc to $21.10 an ounce.¡ªReuters
