As the "Candy Crush" developer heads to the IPO counter, some wonder if it has what it takes to keep momentum going.

King Digital Entertainment created the undisputed champion of games last year with the highly addictive, virtual, sugar-filled game "Candy Crush." Players number 97 million everyday, which is helping to lead King to the IPO counter later this month.

At the time of the public offering, King expects to be valued at about $7.6 billion, with shares pricing between $21 and $24 per share.

"The valuation is hard to argue when you look at the numbers," said Brian Blair, principal at Wedge Partners. " 'Candy Crush' was a top three game last year and in nearly every geography that had an iPhone app store. Universal appeal and distribution like that is hard to find," he said.

While the company offers 180 other games, it's "Candy Crush" which brings in three-quarters of its revenue. So what happens when players get tired of "Candy Crush"?

Take a look at rival Zynga 's stock price, which has been cut in half since its 2011 IPO as the popularity of its own game "Farmville" fell by the wayside.

"As Rovio has done with 'Angry Birds,' there are many ways to milk a franchise. We've seen this in the console gaming world too with numerous iterations of 'Call of Duty' or the Tony Hawk franchise. So 'Candy Crush' will have a long tail, but investors will want to see new titles and franchises emerge," Blair said.

King is scheduled to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KING" on March 26.
