BRENT futures slipped towards US$108 a barrel yesterday as data showing an unexpected fall in China's exports added to fears of a slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy, though geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya limited the decline.

Brent crude declined 55 cents to US$108.45 a barrel by 05h22 GMT, snapping two straight days of gains. US fell 23 cents to US$102.35, after touching a high of US$102.82. It settled up US$1,02 on Friday.







Gold drops as US



growth optimism weighs







GOLD extended losses to a second session yesterday after strong US jobs data eased worries of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal.



Fears among Chinese investors over a slowdown in the world's second biggest economy also hurt prices, with investors in Shanghai futures and spot contracts dumping bullion.



The drop in prices after five straight weekly gains comes despite weaker Asian equities and a geopolitical crisis in Ukraine, which would typically support gold. Spot gold, which fell as much as 0,8% on Monday, was down 0,5% at US$1 333.11 an ounce by 02h47 GMT. It dropped nearly one percent on Friday.







Shanghai copper slides five percent on China concerns







SHANGHAI copper dropped by its five percent daily limit yesterday to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country's first domestic bond default last week.



China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide. The most traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell five percent to 46 670 yuan (US$7 600) a tonne, its lowest since September 2009.



Three month copper on the London Metal Exchange had dropped 1,1% to US$6 709.25 a tonne by 02h56 GMT. It earlier slid as far as US$6 608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at US$6 602, the lowest since July 2010. ¨C Nampa-Reuters
