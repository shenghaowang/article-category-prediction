Before dawn this morning, US Navy commandos boarded and took control of a North Korean-flagged tanker loaded with crude oil smuggled out of Libya, the Pentagon has confirmed.

The move foils attempts by a breakaway Libyan militia to sell the cargo, which is owned by the Libyan government¡¯s National Oil Company, on the black market. It¡¯ll now be returned to Libyan authorities.

The oil was loaded on at the rebel-held port of Sidra, where the tanker¡¯s been docked. Local daily al-Wasat report last week that the ship has $36m of crude oil on it.

Sidra is currently under the control of Ibrahim Jadran, the 32-year old warlord with a history in oil.

Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan had ordered an attack on the North-Korean-flagged tanker, but his failure to stop the activity saw him sacked by the country¡¯s Islamist-led congress last Tuesday; he then fled to Europe.

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement today that nobody was hurt "when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans.¡±

North Korea has denied providing authorisation for the action. News reports have said it was being operated by a company based in Egypt, and was in the Mediterranean looking for buyers for the oil.
