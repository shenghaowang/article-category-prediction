MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - UniCredit, Italy¡¯s biggest bank by assets, is confident it has done more to clean up its balance sheet than what will be required to get a clean bill of health from European regulators, its CEO Federico Ghizzoni said.

UniCredit posted a shock 14-billion euro loss for 2013 after massive writedowns on past acquisitons and rising bad loans.

It said the clean-up was an autonomous decision and was not dictated by the sector-wide health check being conducted by the European Central Bank.

UniCredit is cutting its workforce by 8,500 units by 2018, with more than 5,700 job cuts in Italy.

¡°I believed the group has turned the page. We could have staggered the losses on several years, we decided to take them all in one year,¡± Ghizzoni told reporters.

¡°I am serene we have done more than what will be required by the AQR.¡±

He said the bank did not plan any merger with other lenders and confirmed it would issue an additional Tier 1 bond by mid-2014 to boost its capital base.
