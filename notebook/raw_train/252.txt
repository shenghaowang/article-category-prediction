NEW YORK (AP) ¡ª U.S. stock futures are edging lower after a weak Chinese trade report outweighed optimism on corporate earnings.

Dow Jones Industrial futures are down 9 points at 15,213. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 futures are down 3 points at 1,643. Nasdaq futures are down 4 points at 2,971.

A decline Wednesday would break a four-day winning streak for the market.

Later Wednesday, investors will study the minutes from June's meeting of the Federal Reserve board of governors, along with a speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.
