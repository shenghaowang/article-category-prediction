The Mouvement du 22 Mars (Movement of 22 March) was a French student movement at the University of Nanterre founded on 22 March 1968, which carried out a prolonged occupation of the university's administration building. Among its principal leaders was Daniel Cohn-Bendit.

After occupying the building, the school dean called the police, and a public scuffle ensued that garnered the movement media and intellectual attention.[1] This event was one of a series of clashes that led to the nationwide protests in May 1968 in France.

The events of 22 March became the subject of Robert Merle's 1970 novel Derri¨¨re la vitre (published in the US in 1972 as Behind the Glass).
