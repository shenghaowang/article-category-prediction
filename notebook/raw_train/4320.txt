PARIS¡ªA leading international economic body warns global growth could remain sluggish as a slowdown in the developing world undercuts gains in Europe and the United States.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says in an update to November¡¯s World Economic Outlook that developed economies are suffering a temporary slowdown, mainly due to one-time factors like the harsh winter weather in North America. But it said the underlying trend is one of growth.

The OECD said that emerging markets, by contrast, ¡°are experiencing a marked loss of momentum.¡±

In its report Tuesday, the OECD, a think-tank for the world¡¯s most developed economies, predicts global growth of 3.5 per cent this year from an estimated 2.7 per cent last year.
