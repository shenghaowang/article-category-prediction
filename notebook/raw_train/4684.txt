 Symantec also reiterated its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which was previously provided on January 29, 2014:
 Revenue of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, compared to $1.748 billion in the year-ago period.
 GAAP operating margin of 18.0 to 19.5 percent compared to 14.6 percent in the year-ago period.
 Non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5 to 26.0 percent compared to 24.1 percent in the year ago period.
 GAAP diluted earnings per share between $0.29 and $0.31 as compared to $0.27 in the year-ago period.
 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.42 as compared to $0.44 in the year-ago period.

On behalf of Symantec's board, chairman Daniel Schulman said, "We recognize Steve's contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness. These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec's future, and we remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17. Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company's assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety."
