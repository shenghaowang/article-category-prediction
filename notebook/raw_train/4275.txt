Zacks reaffirmed their underperform rating on shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (NASDAQ:BGFV) in a research note issued to investors on Tuesday. The firm currently has a $11.00 price target on the stock.

 Zacks¡¯ analyst wrote, ¡°The near-term prospects of Big 5 Sporting seem gloomy, given its projections for a challenging second-quarter 2014, which will be characterized by a continued decline in the demand for firearms and ammunition products and a soft consumer environment. As a result, the company formulated a disappointing second-quarter guidance that projects a low negative to low positive single-digit comps growth along with earnings in the range of $0.12 to $0.20. This compares to comps growth of 4.4% and earnings of $0.28 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Moreover, the entry of DICK¡¯s Sporting¡¯s into smaller and mid-sized markets and Sports Chalet and Sports Authority¡¯s venture into the small store format may take a toll on the company¡¯s performance. Taking cue from the troubles ahead, we have downgraded Big 5 to Underperform.¡±
