DENVER (AP) ¡ª In the world¡¯s first accounting of a recreational pot industry, Colorado officials say the state has made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, the first month of sales.

The tax total reported Monday by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

The state legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn¡¯t begin until January.

The taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. The first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school construction.

Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, though not all were open in January.
