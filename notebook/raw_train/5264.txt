The world's biggest retailer is doubling down on the used video game business: Wal-Mart Stores announced today that it has begun selling certified, pre-owned video games in 1,700 stores across the United States.

"With 117 million gamers in the U.S., we are constantly looking to provide new and game-changing offerings to those customers," Laura Phillips, SVP of entertainment for Walmart, said in a statement. "We've said that we would focus on the $2 billion pre-owned market, and we're continuing to deliver on that today."

Walmart launched a video game trade-in program in March, offering customers store credit in the form of gift cards if they turned in their old, used games. Now the company will start selling those used games in selected stores.

By launching a used game program, Walmart --already the nation's second biggest video game retailer-- is increasing its pressure on number one retailer GameStop Corporation, which has an extensive used games program.

Walmart also announced that Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, one of the biggest games of the year, will go on sale in its stores a day before the game's official release date, without requiring a pre-order. The "Day Zero Edition" will be available starting at 12:01 a.m. local time on Monday, Nov. 3 in more than 3,600 stores. Walmart will also offer a 50% bonus on trade-ins for customers who purchase the game.
