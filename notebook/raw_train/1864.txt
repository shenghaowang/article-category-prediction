Today, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney testified at a hearing of Parliament's Treasury Committee on the central bank's February Inflation Report. The Governor pushed his message that there is no rush to increase interest rates, saying that there may be more slack in the economy than the Bank estimated. He repeated that any rate increase will be gradual and limited and agreed with BoE Deputy Governor Charlie Bean statement that the benchmark rate will stay in a range of 2%-3% after increases begin. Specifically, Carney said: ¡°I don¡¯t think that¡¯s an unreasonable sense to get across¡±. He said that spare capacity is ¡°at the upper end¡± of the 1%-1.5% of GDP estimated by the BoE, while another MPC member testifying today said the level of spare capacity in UK may be overstated and is probably under 1%, underlining an area of divergence among BoE officials. On questions about the unemployment rate, the Governor said that recent data suggest a slowdown in the pace of decline in the unemployment rate. As for QE, he said that the Bank will consider unwinding its purchases only after several rate increases.

¡¤ The other noticeable economic event today was the release of Sweden¡¯s CPI for February. The country remained in deflation for a second consecutive month (-0.2% yoy). The Krone fell on the news, but recovered within the next few minutes.
