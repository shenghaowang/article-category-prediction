Americans are riding the rails and buses in greater numbers than anytime since the beginning of the suburban sprawl in the 1950s.

A study by the American Public Transportation Association reports nearly 10.7 billion trips were taken last year, which is the highest number of trips since 1956.

The uptick is not confined to cities like New York and Washington, D.C., which have average high populations of ridership. Cities including Seattle, Denver and San Diego have also seen a huge gain as they expand their public transportation offerings.

Cardiff Garcia of The Financial Times joins Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson to discuss the increasing use of public transportation.
