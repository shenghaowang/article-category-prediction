(Staff and Bloomberg)¡ªStrong e-commerce growth allowed Dick¡¯s Sporting Goods, No. 54 in the Internet Retailer 2018 Top 1000, to grow total revenue by 4.6% year over year despite a 0.9% decline in comparable same-store sales.

Online sales reached 11% of total sales, or roughly a 24% increase in e-commerce sales. That comes to about $210.1 million in e-commerce sales for the first quarter ending May 5, compared with 9% of total sales or about $164.3 million during the first quarter last year.

Total revenue for the quarter beat expectations at $1.91 billion, despite the retailer¡¯s move to end sales of assault-style rifles in February after a shooting at a Florida high school. CEO Ed Stack has since met with elected officials, spoken publicly about the need to increase regulations and hired a lobbying firm to push Congress.

How much those decisions helped or hurt the retailer remains to be seen. Dick¡¯s was struggling to grow revenue before it took these measures, and Stack warned in March that the company would receive some ¡°blowback¡± that would hurt sales. But the chain¡¯s main customers also are parents of school-age children, so the brand could have received a boost of goodwill in some parts of the country.

Dick¡¯s also raised its earning forecast for the year to as much as $3.12 a share, up from $3, because of fewer promotions and more revenue coming from its more profitable private-label brands.
