So maybe it¡¯s no surprise Goldman¡¯s equity strategists call the niche ¡°the next frontier¡± for asset managers. If you¡¯re new to the subject, some liquid-alt funds package access to hedge-fund managers in a mutual-fund format. Others are built to act upon risk-parity, long short, merger arbitrage and other strategies besides conventional stocks and bonds.

It¡¯s still notable that strategists Marc Irizarry, Danielle Matsumoto and Stephen Jones go so far as to compare liquid alts¡¯ promise to the fast-growing early days of exchange-traded funds.

In a note Friday, the group predicts so-called retail liquid alternatives are in the early stages of a 5-10 year growth cycle, one which could produce 15-20% annual asset growth. (That¡¯s 15-20% asset growth for the fund managers, not investor returns.) The market could reach $2 trillion in assets, they predict, a ll of which would be much like ETFs¡¯ heady growth.

Here¡¯s what¡¯s certain: The pace of fund launches is white hot, having tripled since 2009, as f und managers are keen to sell strategies that command a premium.

Liquid alts are twice as costly as traditional actively managed funds. The hope is that this year¡¯s pummeling in the bond market and recent years¡¯ stock volatility will make investors appreciate the slow, steady returns of liquid alts when they work. This runs against the opinion more frequently heard of late that ¡°liquid alts¡± are just too complex for the average investor to understand
