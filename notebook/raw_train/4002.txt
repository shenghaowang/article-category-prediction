The country¡¯s air force chief, Gen. Rodzali Daud, released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had managed to track the aircraft turning back from its original course, crossing the country and making it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Rodzali referred to a statement he said he made March 9 in which he said the air force has ¡°not ruled out the possibility of an air turn back¡± and said search and rescue efforts had been expanded to the waters around Penang Island, in the northern section of the strait.

¡°It¡¯s stretching belief a little bit that someone¡¯s going to be capable enough in the (777) to do all that,¡± Middleton said. ¡°It¡¯s a very curious outcome, you just can¡¯t rule out the possibility that the captain or the first officer have gone crazy,¡± he said.
