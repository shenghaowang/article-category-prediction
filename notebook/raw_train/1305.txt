The government says it is satisfied with REMPEC＊s oil spill prevention efforts, but Environment Minister Leo Brincat yesterday refused to go into detail regarding preparations for a possible ecological disaster in the Mediterranean as the Libyan government has stepped up its threats of blowing up an oil tanker loaded with ※illicit oil§.

The situation in Libya has turned from bad to worse as rebels in command of a number of ports are trying to export oil illegally from the country from three ports they occupied months ago.

The ship in question 每 the North Korean flagged ＆Morning Glory＊ 每 is currently moored in Al-Sidra port, near Ras Lanuf, some 300 kilometres from Malta. Libyan officials said on Monday that the ship had finished loading its bunkers with illegal oil, estimated to be worth some $36 million.

The Libyan authorities yesterday turned things up a notch, with the country＊s Culture Minister, Al-Habib al-Amin insisting that the ship would be blown out of the water should it attempt to leave port. ※It is final and decisive. Any attempt by the tanker to move and it will be turned into scrap.§

The tanker is currently besieged by Libyan Navy ships and loyalist militias, who insisted that if the ship did not surrender it would be ※shelled completely.§ According to reports the loyalist militias have placed 22 fishing vessels armed with mortar and rocket launchers around the tanker.

But the rebels have insisted that an attack on the vessel would be considered an act of war and they would retaliate. Abb-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement, said: "harming any tanker or sending navy ships into the waters of Cyrenaica. It the tanker is harmed the response from Cyrenaica's defense forces, oil guards and revolutionaries will be decisive. Such a move would be a declaration of war."

Situation could turn into an ecological disaster

Sources told this paper that any attack on the ship could result in an ecological disaster off the coast of Libya with thousands of tons of oil pouring into the Mediterrenean.

When asked if he was concerned by these developments Environment Minister Leo Brincat said that the government had taken immediate action.

※The moment we were alerted about the problem we took immediate action and asked REMPEC to take all the necessary measures. This was done to our satisfaction throughout Sunday wherein we were kept updated about the situation.§

REMPEC is the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea, which is based in Malta. However, when asked to be more specific on these ※necessary measures§ Mr Brincat curtly replied that ※he has nothing to add.§

The port of Al-Sidra has been under militia control since the summer, slowing the country's oil output 〞 once estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day 〞 to a trickle. For months the Libyan government has been threatening to use force against the Eastern militias, who are demanding greater self-rule and equal distribution of the oil wealth. Libya has been gripped by unrest since the ousting of dictator Muammar Ghaddafi in 2011 as militias from different tribes have seized power over different areas and refused to give up control, and their weapons.

Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said on Sunday that he had given the order for more troops to move into the al-Sidra area and the Prosecutor General has issued an arrest warrant for the tanker captain and its crew members. He also ordered the tanker to be confiscated.

It seems that the Libyan government has Washington＊s backing. The US Department of State said on Sunday that it was deeply concerned by reports that a tanker is loading illicitly obtained oil.

※This action is counter to law and amounts to theft from the Libyan people,§ it said, insisting that the oil belongs to the Libyan government and private oil companies, including US firms.

On the other hand experts have noted that the ship is not actually controlled by Pyongyang but is likely to be using the North Korean flag as a flag of convenience.

In January, Libyan forces had fired warning shots and stopped a Maltese registered tanker 每 the mv Baku 每 from reaching the port.
