Investigators say the plane was intentionally diverted, and could have flown on either a northern or southern arc from its last known position. 



The northern arc, as you can see here, stretches from northern Thailand to central Asia. Aviation experts say that it would have been difficult for the plane to dodge radar surveillance on this route. This means whoever flew the plane is more likely to have chosen the southern arc, which stretches from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.
