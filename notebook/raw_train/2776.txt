BEIJING¡ªChinese Premier Li Keqiang promised to keep economic growth humming this year and to further rein in corruption by limiting the powers of government officials to interfere in business.

Speaking at what is typically just one news conference a year for Chinese premiers, Mr. Li said China had surmounted a credit squeeze, flagging demand and other economic headwinds last year. This year, he said, the difficulties are greater.
