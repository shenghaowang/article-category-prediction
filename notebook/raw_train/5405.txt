The last thing we heard about Mt. Gox, was that the company was allowing users to log in and check their Bitcoin balance, this was after the company filed for Bankruptcy in the US and Japan.

Mt. Gox lost around 850,000 Bitcoins belonging to their customers which were worth around $400 million, and now the company has found 200,000 Bitcoins in an old wallet.

¡°On March 7, 2014, MtGox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC,¡± the statement said.

It added that it moved the 200,000 bitcoins from online to offline wallets on March 14-15 ¡°for security reasons.¡± ¡°These bitcoin movements, including the change in the manner in which these coins were stored, had been reported to the court and the supervisor by counsels,¡± it noted.

Hopefully this will mean that people who lost money which will held in Bitcoin through Mt. Gox will get at least some of their money back, although nothing has been confirmed as yet.
