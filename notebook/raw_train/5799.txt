eBay CEO John Donahoe beat out rival Jeff Bezos of Amazon on Glassdoor's list of the top 51 CEOs of large U.S. companies as rated by employees over the past 12 months. That's a long way from 2008 when Donahoe made Glassdoor's "naughty list," a term it coined for the CEOs with the highest disapproval ratings (with at least 50 reviews) and at risk of being ousted.



Donahoe came in 20th place this year with a rating of 91%, while Bezos came in 33rd place with a rating of 86%. Glassdoor compiled the list by looking at U.S.-based companies with at least 1,000 employees and with at least 100 CEO approval ratings between February 1, 2013 - January 31, 2014. 



Bezos came in 16th place last year for the second consecutive year with a 93% approval rating in 2013, up from 80% in 2012. Donahoe did not appear on the career site's list last year. (Note that due to an error in omitting one CEO from the list, Glassdoor had placed Donahoe at 19th place and Bezos at 32nd when it first published the 2014 list this week.)



eBay does not fare as well as Amazon on Glassdoor company ratings, however. eBay garnered a 3.3 out of 5 on Glassdoor reviews; 60% of employees recommend eBay to a friend; and 62% approve of the CEO.



Amazon.com garnered a 3.4 out of 5 on Glassdoor reviews; 65% of employees recommend Amazon to a friend; and 87% approve of the CEO.



Tech firms placed well on Glassdoor's list of top CEO's this year: LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner came in 1st place with a 100% approval rating. Qualcomm, Intuit, Facebook, Google, Salesforce and Apple CEOs also made the list.



Shipping carrier FedEx CEO Fred Smith came in just above eBay's Donahoe. And as for retailers, Costco Wholesale, Starbucks, J.Crew, Nordstrom, Publix, Gap, Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, The Home Depot and Best Buy also made the list of top-rated 50 CEOs by employees.



Presumably a high ranking on Glassdoor will attract talented workers, though company reviews may be more helpful to prospective employees than the popularity of CEOs.
