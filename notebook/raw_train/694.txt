Men¡¯s Wearhouse has finally agreed to consider a takeover offer from Jos. A. Bank ¡ª at least, that¡¯s what a Men¡¯s Wearhouse shareholder says.

Hedge-fund manager Ricky Sandler of Eminence Capital disclosed in a letter that he spoke on the phone with Men¡¯s Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert on Monday, and that Ewert told him the retailer will consider a $2.3 billion buyout offer from Jos. A. Bank it had spurned in September.

Eminence ¡ª which has became the largest shareholder of Men¡¯s Wearhouse, having disclosed a 9.8-percent stake last week ¡ª said he was ¡°encouraged¡± by the phone call and that other options included distributing ¡°significant¡± cash to investors.

Jos. A. Bank, which has offered $48 a share for Men¡¯s Wearhouse, said in a letter Nov. 1 that it would consider raising the offer if it is allowed access to its rival¡¯s books, adding that it would walk away if it got no response by Nov. 14.

¡°We also fully expect you and the board, given the explicit commitment to explore all options, to actively engage with Jos. A. Bank before their deadline,¡± Sandler said.

Eminence previously said reasons for rejecting the Jos. A Bank takeover offer were ¡°reckless and misinformed,¡± though it agreed with Men¡¯s Wearhouse that the $2.3 billion bid was too low.

Shares of Jos. A. Bank rose 3.5 percent to $50.26 on Tuesday, reflecting rising optimism that Jos. A. Bank is gathering support for its bid.

Still, shares of Men¡¯s Wearhouse rose just 2.4 percent to $44.08, well short of the $48 bid price ¡ª a sign of lingering doubts on Wall Street that a deal will get done.
