The eurozone's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly in April, in a setback for the European Central Bank as it considers whether and when to end its bond-buying stimulus program.

The European Union's statistics agency said Thursday that consumer prices were 1.2% higher than in April 2017, a fall from the 1.3% rate of inflation recorded in March. It said the core rate of inflation--which excludes more volatile items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco--fell to 0.7% from 1% in March, hitting its lowest level since March 2017.

The ECB halved its monthly bond purchases in January, encouraged by a pickup in economic growth during 2017 that it hoped would help raise inflation to its target of just below 2% over the coming years. Policy makers must now decide whether to extend the program beyond its tentatively scheduled end in September, and for how long.

Inflation has remained stubbornly low since the turn of 2018. Coupled with a slowdown in economic growth at the start of the year, those weak price readings are likely to reinforce the ECB's caution as it approaches that big decision.

The drop in inflation was driven by a sharp deceleration in prices paid for services. They were up just 1% on the year in April, having been 1.5% higher in March. Some of that pullback had been expected, since March prices were boosted by the Easter holiday.

The decline in inflation will come as a surprise to ECB policy makers. ECB President Mario Draghi said in a late April news conference that they expect the inflation rate to "hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year."

Some ECB policy makers, including Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, have called for an end to the bond buying program this year, and a first rise in the key interest rate around mid-2019. They believe that the economy's continued expansion, along with declines in unemployment, will help raise the inflation rate to their target by 2020.
