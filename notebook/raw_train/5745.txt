The Justice Department is expected to announce a settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. as early as Wednesday that could cost the auto maker more than $1 billion to end a criminal probe into its disclosure of safety issues, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.
