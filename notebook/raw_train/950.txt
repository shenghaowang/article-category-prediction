King Digital Entertainment, maker of hit mobile phone game "Candy Crush Saga", expects to be worth up to $US7.6 billion ($8.5 billion) when it goes public this month in the United States, amid concerns about its over reliance on the game.

King will hope to benefit from its focus on the estimated $US17 billion market for mobile game apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga, which has struggled to make its games as popular on phones as they are online.

"Candy Crush," which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app and top revenue-grossing app in 2013. The game accounts for nearly three-quarters of King's revenue.

Dublin-based King said it expects to price its IPO at $US21-$US24 per share, valuing it at up to $US7.6 billion - slightly higher than Hasbro, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

"I think the bankers have priced the deal in a way so that initial investors can realize a first-day pop in the stock," said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.
