Patrick Drahi, the controlling shareholder of French cable operator Numericable Group, has said he will not be increasing his bid for Vivendi¡¯s SFR.

In an interview with French daily Les Echos, Drahi said he had no reason to raise his offer. ¡°I have worked seven years on this,¡± he commented. ¡°I have no reason to modify it.¡±

Drahi¡¯s comment comes as Altice, the Luxembourg holding group that controls Numericable, finds itself in a bidding war with French conglomerate Bouygues to buy SFR.

Altice has confirmed it had made a firm offer to Vivendi which includes 10.9 billion in cash and would grant a 32 per cent stake to Vivendi in the newly merged Numericable-SFR unit.

Bouygues on the other hand offered 10.5 billion in cash and a 46 per cent stake in a newly merged Bouygues Telecom-SFR group.

Drahi reiterated that his offer stands until Friday (March 14th). He said a merged Numericable-SFR would be based and listed and pay taxes in France, in a bid to reassure French officials. He also said he would be the president of a merged group if his offer is picked.
