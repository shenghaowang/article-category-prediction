Colorado made about $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world¡¯s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Revenue Department indicates that $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected about $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn¡¯t begin until January. Sales in Washington state will begin in the coming months.

The pot taxes come from a 12.9 percent sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax. Voters approved the taxes last year. They said that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go toward school construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers.

The United Methodist Church announced on Monday that it is dropping its case against a New York clergyman accused of defying church policy by officiating at his son¡¯s same-sex wedding.

The church said a trial over the actions of the Rev. Thomas Ogletree, a former dean at Yale University¡¯s divinity school, could cause ¡°harmful polarization¡± during the ongoing debate about the church¡¯s stance on same-sex unions.

The move came three months after a Pennsylvania pastor was defrocked after he was found guilty of officiating at his son¡¯s same-sex wedding. Instead of facing trial, Ogletree will participate in conversations about the church¡¯s policy on such unions.
