A GENERALLY lacklustre and mixed session on Thursday ended with the Straits Times Index 10.07 points lower at 3,268.88 and the broad market excluding warrants at an almost even 222 rises versus 234 falls.

It was the third consecutive loss for the index after Monday's 29-point jump. Between Tuesday and Thursday, the index has fallen back by about 40 points.

Lingering geopolitical uncertainties, a fall in the Dow futures and a weak opening for Europe were cited as the main factors behind the softness here, though equally likely as far as the local market is concerned is that most of the positive earnings news has already been priced in.
