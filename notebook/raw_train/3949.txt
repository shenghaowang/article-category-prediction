Having done two stints as a writer and performer on ¡°Saturday Night Live,¡± Sen. Al Franken knows a thing or two about NBC. This morning on CBS, the Minnesota democrat said NBC parent company Comcast¡¯s acquisition of Time Warner Cable ¡°will be bad for consumers of TV, of cable TV and of the Internet.

¡°I think consumers will end up paying more, there will be less competition, there will be less innovation and worse, even worse service,¡± Fraken said on ¡°CBS This Morning.¡±

As chairman of the Privacy, Technology, and Law Subcommittee, Franken also discussed Steve Kroft¡¯s report on personal data being harvested by marketing companies.

¡°You saw it last night on ¡¯60 Minutes,'¡± said Franken. ¡°I really believe that Americans have a right to privacy, that they have a right to know what¡¯s being taken, what of their private information¡¯s being taken, and to give permission if you¡¯re going to take their private information.¡±
