KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Satellite images on a Chinese government website may show debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner floating a few days ago off the southern tip of Vietnam near the plane's original flight path, China's Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.

The revelation could provide searchers with a focus that has eluded them since the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard just hours after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday. Since then, the search has covered 92,600 square kilometres, first east and then west of Malaysia and even expanded toward India on Wednesday.

The Chinese sighting, if confirmed, would be closer to where the frantic hunt started.

The Xinhua report said the images from around 11 a.m. Sunday appear to show "three suspected floating objects" of varying sizes in a 20-kilometre radius, the largest about 24 by 22 metres.
