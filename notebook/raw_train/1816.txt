Vodafone Group Monday jump-started its post-Verizon future, but AT&T remains in the wings.

The U.K. mobile giant says it is accelerating its plan to be a ¡°unified communications¡± player following its 7.2 billion ($10 billion) buy of Spain¡¯s cable operator Ono, the first acquisition since Vodafone sold to Verizon Communications its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, the U.S.¡¯s biggest wireless operator, for a landmark $130 billion. But Vodafone itself is targeted.

Last week, AT&T warned the window for a wireless deal in Europe may be closing. The company has been open about its interest in Europe, and people familiar with the matter say it has explored a bid for Vodafone.
