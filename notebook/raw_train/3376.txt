As we observed in recent quarterly letters, market returns have continued to be dominated by 4 companies from the group that CNBC's James Cramer has dubbed the FAANG stocks: during the first 9 months of 2018, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google accounted for a majority of the S&P 500's gains. More broadly, the top 10 contributors for the S&P 500, virtually all of them high-multiple technology businesses, were responsible for more than 110% of the indices' gain for the first 9 months of 2018. The S&P 500, inclusive of dividends, advanced 10.56% for the first 9 months of 2018, but this movement was driven by a dwindling number of stocks.
