CNBC reports that The Federal Trade Commission [FTC] has opened a formal investigation into Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) following more than a year of scrutiny over its business practices. Shares of the company, which sells vitamins, shakes and other supplements, nosedived as much as 15% after being briefly halted.

After reiterating its willingness to fully cooperate with the FTC, Herbalife said it ¡°welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace.¡±

On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has called the company a ¡°massive pyramid scheme¡± and has placed a $1.16 billion short bet against it, stepped up his battle against Herbalife by accusing it of operating illegally in China.

¡°We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Herbalife is a financially strong and successful company, having created meaningful value for shareholders, significant opportunities for distributors and positively impacted the lives and health of its consumers for over 34 years,¡± the company said in a statement.

Herbalife¡¯s shares have recovered slightly in midday trading and are currently down $5.82, or 8.90%, at $59.67. HLF hit an intraday low of $54.59, or 17%, at one point after the FTC news hit the wires. Today¡¯s range: $54.59 ¨C $69.41.
