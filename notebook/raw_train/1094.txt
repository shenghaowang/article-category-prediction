The European Union¡¯s to-do list isn¡¯t long this week, but anyone interested in financial regulation should get ready for some late nights. The bloc is pushing for a final deal on a new bank-resolution framework for the euro zone and more transparency on foreign bank accounts. The crisis in Ukraine will certainly also occupy minds in Brussels.

On Monday, euro-zone finance ministers meet for some ordinary business: Cyprus, whose third review a year after its bailout was just completed, is expecting a fresh injection of cash to be approved. The money won¡¯t reach the island till April. There had been hopes that Greece, too, could get the finance ministers¡¯ backing for a fresh disbursement of aid, but the required work in Athens hasn¡¯t been concluded. Experts from the troika of institutions overseeing the Greek bailout ¡ª the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank ¡ª will report to ministers and then return to the Greek capital to wrap up their review.
