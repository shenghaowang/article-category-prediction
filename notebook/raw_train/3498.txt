Starbucks will soon let customers leave tips with its mobile payment app, which raises the question ¡ª how often do people tip their baristas?

The coffee chain says the mobile tipping option, which it announced more than a year ago, will be available on its updated app for iPhones starting March 19. The rollout comes as the company¡¯s app has surged in popularity, with roughly one out of every 10 purchases now made with a mobile device.

After paying with the app, Starbucks says customers will be able to leave a tip of 50 cents, $1 or $2 anytime within two hours of the transaction. The tipping option will only be available at the 7,000 of the roughly 11,000 Starbucks locations in the U.S. that are owned by the company.

The move puts a spotlight on what can be a sensitive topic for customers, workers and even Starbucks, which has faced lawsuits over how it divvies up the contents of tip jars. Some customers are happy to tip for friendly service, knowing baristas don¡¯t earn that much. Others say they already fork over enough money and shouldn¡¯t be made to feel like they should throw money into a tip jar as well.

Starbucks said mobile tips will be paid in cash in line with how workers get regular tips.

Exactly how Starbucks divides up the tip jars varies. Shannon Liss Riordan, an attorney who represented baristas in lawsuits saying shift supervisors shouldn¡¯t share in tips, said the cash is typically distributed on a weekly basis.
 ¡°They keep it in a safe and dole it out to employees ... based on the number of hours worked,¡± she said.
