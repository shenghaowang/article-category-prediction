Statement: Anti-Lock Brakes

 March 7, 2014 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Chrysler Group is recalling approximately 25,250 SUVs to improve pedal feel during certain aggressive braking maneuvers.

 

 A supplier raised with the Company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop. Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations.

 

 Chrysler Group is unaware of any related injuries or accidents.

 

 An investigation discovered brake-fluid flow was being restricted too much. A software update optimizes flow and restores appropriate pedal feel.

 

 Affected are certain Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs from model years 2012 and 2013 ¨C approximately 18,700 in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico and 5,200 outside the NAFTA region.

 

 Chrysler Group will notify affected customers when to schedule service. Repair costs will be borne by the Company.

 

 Customers who remain concerned may call 1-800-853-1403.
