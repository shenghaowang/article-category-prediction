The Response:

Elliott Management issued a public response Tuesday to statements made by executives of Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), which the activist investor labeled as "grossly misleading." Elliott filed a presentation by Moelis & Company (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/904495/000119312514093183/d691370dex99f.htm) as part of an amended 13D, which Elliott says "validates the attractiveness of Elliott's $21-per-share bid for Riverbed."

Elliott was responding to comments Riverbed CEO Jerry Kennelly and CFO Ernie Maddock, who told Bloomberg that no ¡°serious¡± party had made a ¡°credible¡± bid for the Company.

Riverbed has rejected offers of $19.00 per share and $21.00 per share from Elliott.
