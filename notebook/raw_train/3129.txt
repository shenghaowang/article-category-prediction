In Japan, disappointing economic data upstaged the exchange rate for the yen as the dominant factor in stock market activity on Monday. The nation¡¯s GDP expansion during the fourth quarter of 2013 fell short of expectations, reaching only 0.70 percent. The result indicated a retreat from the preliminary estimate of 1.0 percent growth and it fell short of economists¡¯ expectations for 0.90 percent expansion.

Japan¡¯s Ministry of Finance had more bad news on Monday. The nation¡¯s current account deficit expanded to the equivalent of over $15 billion ¨C its highest level in almost 30 years.

The Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 1.01 percent to 15,120 (EWJ).

In China, Saturday¡¯s release of the nation¡¯s trade balance report brought bad news. The nation¡¯s exports decreased by 18.1 percent on a year-over-year basis in February, resulting in a trade deficit. The awful report is expected to put pressure on the People¡¯s Bank of China to weaken the yuan. The report re-ignited concerns about the state of the global economy, sending the spot price of copper 1.62 percent lower (after a 4.27 percent nosedive on Friday) to $3.03 per pound.

The Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.86 percent to 1,999 (FXI). Hong Kong¡¯s Hang Seng Index fell 1.75 percent to 22,264 (EWH).

The bad news from China caused mining companies to drag the major European stock indices lower. Ongoing tension over Russia¡¯s plans for Crimea kept European investors in a risk-averse mood. The Euro STOXX 50 Index finished Monday¡¯s session with a 0.08 percent dip to 3,092.79 ¨C remaining just a whisker above its 50-day moving average of 3,092.38. Its Relative Strength Index is 48.12 (FEZ).

Technical indicators revealed that the S&P 500 remained above its 50-day moving average of 1,827 on Monday, despite taking a 0.05 percent dip to 1,877. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) declined from 66.40 to 65.92. The MACD and the signal line are both climbing above the zero line, suggesting that the S&P could resume its advance during the immediate future.

On Monday, four sectors advanced and five sectors declined. The industrial sector took the hardest hit, falling 0.43 percent.

Bottom line: Russia¡¯s Crimean adventure combined with disappointing export data from China to send stocks moderately lower on Monday.
