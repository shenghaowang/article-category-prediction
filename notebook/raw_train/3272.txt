This mortgage has set payments, like all mortgages, but you are free to increase them by any amount, at any time. Of course, if you increase the amount you pay, you¡¯ll save money on overall interest.

With a variable rate mortgage, the interest rate can fluctuate along with any changes in our TD Mortgage Prime Rate. Your principal and interest payment will stay the same for the term, but if the TD Mortgage Prime Rate goes down, more of your payment will go towards the principal. If the TD Mortgage Prime Rate goes up, more will go towards interest. If your interest rate increases so that the monthly payment does not cover the interest amount, you will be required to adjust your payments, make a prepayment, or pay off the balance of the mortgage.

You can also lock in your interest rate by converting to any fixed rate mortgage at any time. Your regular payments will remain the same.
