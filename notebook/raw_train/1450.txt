Almost 25 years ago, banana giants Chiquita and Fyffes were embroiled in a turf war in the fields of Honduras. Now though, the companies are merging in a billion dollar deal that would create the biggest banana company in the world. WSJ's Neil Hickey reports.

Chiquita Brands International Inc. agreed to merge with Irish tropical-fruit company Fyffes PLC to create the world's largest banana company, catapulting it past Dole Food Co.

In a $1.07 billion all-stock deal, the new company¡ªto be called ChiquitaFyffes¡ªwould have 32,000 employees and $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas.
