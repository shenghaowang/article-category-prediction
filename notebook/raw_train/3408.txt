The Federal Trade Commission has launched a civil investigation into Herbalife, the Los Angeles-based nutritional-products maker said Wednesday.

Herbalife, which did not disclose any details of the probe, has been battling a hedge fund manager¡¯s allegations that it is running a thinly disguised pyramid scheme.

¡°Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC,¡± the company said in a statement. ¡°We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.¡±

Herbalife¡¯s shares sank, closing down more than 7percent at $60.57, after the company disclosed that the federal agency had sent it a civil investigative demand.

The company sells nutrition and health products through independent salespeople in more than 80 countries.

Its products are not available in stores.
