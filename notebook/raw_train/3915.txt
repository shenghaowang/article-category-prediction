Furious about your Mt. Gox losses? You¡¯ll have to cool your heels.

U.S. legal actions against Mt. Gox ¡ª notably a lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court that sought class-action status ¡ª are on temporary hold after the bitcoin exchange submitted a bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday.

Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection, designed for cases where the parties are based in multiple countries. The Tokyo company, once the world¡¯s largest bitcoin trading post, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28.

At the time it said 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox bitcoins were missing, meaning a cool $450 million had gone up in smoke.

The U.S. bankruptcy eventually could benefit stranded investors, giving the U.S. a structure to work with other countries to track down any remaining assets.

Over the weekend, furious bitcoin users hacked the website of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, posting data that appears to show that the exchange still holds customer investments in the millions of dollars.

¡°It¡¯s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities¡¯ wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,¡± an anonymous hacker wrote.

So on the downside, Mt. Gox has imploded. On the upside, it¡¯s vaulted into the echelons of companies whose names became common verbs. Of course, being synonymous with total flakiness is not something most CEOs aspire to.

Believe it or not, getting ¡°goxed¡± first showed up in Urban Dictionary almost three years ago after a spate of Mt. Gox closures and trading delays, but it¡¯s caught fire in the past couple of weeks.
