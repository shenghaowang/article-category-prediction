The head of the world¡¯s biggest bond fund, Pimco¡¯s has promised to loosen the reins of control over his portfolio managers just weeks after details of a heated feud between him and his former executive were brought to light.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal published details of an open-office argument between Mr Gross, who co-founded Pimco in 1971 and Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco¡¯s chief executive, who was quoted saying ¡°I¡¯m tired of cleaning up your s---", in reference to conduct by Mr Gross he felt was hurting Pimco.

It has since been revealed in a Financial Times report Morningstar analyst Eric Jacobson, who recently met with Mr Gross, said the 69-year-old seems ¡°very contemplative about mistakes he may have made in shaping that atmosphere in the past".

He added Mr Gross ¡°has speculated there may have been a lot more silence in the room when he and Mohamed [El-Erian] were dominating the [investment] committee, because members of the group were anxious about taking positions that might upset one of them or the other," the Times reported.
