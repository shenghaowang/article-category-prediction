An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world¡¯s most valuable life insurance policy. The man who cobbled the deal together said on Saturday that it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100 million (R1.1 billion at current rates) policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

¡°Not one company can afford to take a $201m hit,¡± said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a man he called ¡°a well-known billionaire¡±.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen¡¯s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Frances said. ¡°It was worse than any audit you can think of.¡±

Guinness credits Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK insurance salesman Peter Rosengard who helped put together Geffen¡¯s policy.

Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG, which has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

He said the billionaire wanted to remain anonymous for the sake of privacy, and to keep the news from his beneficiaries. ¡°He wants his next of kin to keep working hard.¡±

He said the man purchased the policy to help his heirs avoid paying a 45 percent inheritance tax on his death. ¨C Daily Mail
