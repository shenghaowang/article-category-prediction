WASHINGTON, D.C. (WKZO) -- The recall of 1.6-million General Motors vehicles for ignition switch problems is now under investigation by the Justice Department according to sources speaking to the "Detroit News."

Congress and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are already seeking answers on what took the automaker roughly a decade to issue the recall after engineers first noticed the problem in 2004. To date, 12 people have died in 31 crashes from the ignition switches being able to be turned off when the vehicles are moving.

GM's new CEO, Mary Barra, has also ordered an internal probe.
