Looking for a good boss? This list might be the place to start. Glassdoor has released its annual list of the Highest Rated CEOs for 2014, determined by employee feedback. As you can imagine, several technology names are near the top of the list, including Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn (#1); Paul Jacobs of Qualcomm (#4); and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (#9).

Also worth noting is the number of Seattle retailers who score high in the list, including Craig Jelinek of Costco (#5); Howard Schultz of Starbucks (#8); Blake Nordstrom of Nordstrom (#23); and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com (#32).

Microsoft¡¯s new boss, Satya Nadella, does not make the list. But Ford¡¯s Alan Mulally, who was in the running for the top post, finished in the second slot with a 97 percent approval rating.

¡°Top rated CEOs are commonly seen as relatable, accessible and transparent,¡± said Robert Hohman, Glassdoor CEO and co-founder.

Glassdoor also released for the first time a list of the top 25 CEOs at small and mid-sized companies. Several tech CEOs make the list, including a few from the Seattle area such as Zillow¡¯s Spencer Rascoff and Edifecs Sunny Singh.
