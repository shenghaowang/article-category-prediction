"While certainly there are healthy companies in every restaurant category, our analysis suggests that, without aggressive intervention, up to 40 percent of chains face the possibility of a severe liquidity crisis, which could mean failure, within a year," said Andy Eversbusch, a managing director at AlixPartners and leader of the firm's Restaurant and Food Services practice. "Overall, we found declining growth rates and declining same-store sales in all four sectors, as well as declining EBITDA in three of the four sectors, with only quick-service restaurants bucking that latter trend."
