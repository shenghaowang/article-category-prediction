An update to Starbucks¡¯ iPhone app, arriving on March 19, will let users add a tip of $0.50, $1 or $2 while paying for coffee. According to Engadget, the app will also send a push notification encouraging users to tip after they¡¯ve paid. Users will have up to two hours to alter their tip amount.

¡°As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have also asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to store partners,¡± Cliff Burrows, Starbucks¡¯ group president for the United States and Americas, said in a statement. Starbucks says mobile payments account for 11 percent of all transactions, 5 million transactions per week.

The update also adds a way to immediately bring up the payment screen from within the app by shaking your phone. Android phones will get the update later this year.
