Winter-weary northerners can get their Florida fix via JetBlue¡¯s new daily flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Fort Myers, Jacksonville, and West Palm Beach. Until Jan. 4, departures are twice-daily for all destinations, but after that, Fort Myers and West Palm will revert to once a day.

These additions augment JetBlue¡¯s status as a warm-weather carrier at Reagan National. Earlier in the year, they established a route to Nassau, Bahamas, and increased service to Tampa to two flights a day. Travelers can also fly to Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood, Orlando, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

"Washington has been a major focus of investment and growth for JetBlue in recent years,¡± noted Rob Land,senior vice president, government affairs and associate general counsel in a press release.

"We welcome JetBlue's new nonstop flights to these popular Florida destinations," said Jack Potter, president and CEO of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. "The expanded service further enhances the travel experience for our passengers."
