Washington - US Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker late on Sunday that had been seized earlier this month at a Libyan port by three armed men, the US Department of Defence said.

No one was hurt in the boarding operation, approved by US President Barack Obama, requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters south-east of Cyprus, said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.
