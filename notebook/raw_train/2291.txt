Residential property prices in the UK rose to an all-time high in March as the ongoing economic recovery and a favourable mortgage market boosted demand, while rising prices lured more sellers back into the property market.

However, the growth rate was lower than February's 3.3%. The average asking price for a new property coming to market climbed to GBP255,962 from GBP25,1964 in February, setting a new record.

The Chinese government is set to allow its currency, the renminbi or yuan, to fluctuate more widely against the dollar in the latest sign that the country is loosening its grip on the economy. China's Central Bank said that beginning on Monday, the daily trading band would double to 2% on either side of a government-regulated parity rate, which could result in wider price fluctuations. "The widening is within rational range and is a tentative step towards the liberalization of the yuan's exchange rate," said Yi Xianrong, a senior financial researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

China unveiled measures to speed urbanization in a bid to provide impetus to economic growth through lifting income and consumption among rural residents. In its urbanization plan for 2014-2020, the government said Sunday it will reform "hukou" registration, and improve water safety as well as air quality. The "hukou" a complex household registration system discourages rural residents to move and settle in urban areas. Easing controls on residency status will unlock huge income potential and raise domestic demand.

China sharply criticized Malaysia for its handling of an investigation into the disappearance of a commercial aircraft with 239 people aboard nine days ago. The criticism came as a Malaysian police source ruled out a connection between the pilot's political affiliations and the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370. China's official state news agency Xinhua said valuable time was lost due to the "lack of authoritative information" about what happened to the aircraft, which had radically changed course and had its communication system deliberately turned off.

Malaysia is to deploy its ships and aircraft in the "southern corridor" as it refocused its search operations for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, which disappeared more than a week ago. The area in question stretches approximately from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. The refocus in search and rescue operations came after Prime Minister Najib Razak announced Saturday that the plane's communication system was intentionally disabled and the aircraft flew for up to seven hours toward an unknown destination. Malaysia's announcement that it would deploy its assets in the southern corridor came as Australia's Pirme Minister Tony Abbot said his country had agreed to take the lead in the search and rescue operations in the Indian Ocean.

US Secretary of State John Kerry set the stage for Abbas' meeting with Obama on Sunday when he held a "frank and productive" discussion with Abbas about reaching a framework for negotiations in Middle East peace talks, according to a statement released by a senior State Department official.
