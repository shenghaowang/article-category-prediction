Yes, said Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on Tuesday and raised his price target to $11 from $7.50. The move sent Penney shares up as much as 10.2% in early trading.

Chen said the company may be successful in getting back the shoppers lost during former CEO Ron Johnson¡¯s failed reign. Penney has brought back its key private-label products including St. John¡¯s Bay, Worthington and Ambrielle taken out under Johnson as Chief Executive Mike Ullman has said he aims to increase store brands, which are more profitable than national brands, to a level of about 50% of sales from 30% under Johnson. Meanwhile, a better assortment of national labels including Levi¡¯s, Nike and Carter¡¯s also are helping to bring customers back, the analyst noted.

He also applauded the company¡¯s /quotes/zigman/237947/delayed /quotes/nls/jcp JCP ¡°taking the pain now to go narrow and deep¡± with its move to remove merchandise including Justin Timberlake¡¯s William Rast label as well as JCP Everyday, the home furnishings line designed by home maven Martha Stewart /quotes/zigman/250056/delayed /quotes/nls/mso MSO that had been at the center of controversy with Penney¡¯s key rival Macy¡¯s Inc. /quotes/zigman/467976/delayed /quotes/nls/m M . While exiting those merchandise has hurt gross margin in the fourth quarter, Chen said he doesn¡¯t expect discontinued labels to continue to hurt first-quarter margin. He sees ¡°significant¡± improvement in margin this year.

Meanwhile, the company¡¯s home merchandise, the worst performing section under Johnson that had declined to 12% of sales in 2012 from nearly 20% in 2008, may also get a boost as Penney overhauls the segment. The analyst said merchandising changes in the kids¡¯ department also will be a boost.

Penney ¡°isn¡¯t taking substantial fashion risk but just going back to what worked before and marketing to drive prudent traffic,¡± Chen said, adding investors¡¯ fears on the company¡¯s liquidity position ¡°are overdone.¡± He said he sees the company to end the year with $2 billion liquidity, in line with company projection. ¡°Achieving (first quarter) and (fiscal year) guidance will mitigate investor fear on liquidity concerns and drive profitability and the stock higher.¡±
