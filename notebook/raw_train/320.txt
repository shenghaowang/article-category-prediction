The company behind the addictive blockbuster game Candy Crush Saga believes it could raise nearly $US613 million ($A685 million) in an initial public offering.

In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, King Digital Entertainment said it plans to sell 15.3 million shares in the offering.

Candy Crush was the most downloaded free app on iPhones and iPads in 2013, beating Facebook, Google Maps and YouTube.

The shares are expected to be priced between $US21 and $US24, for a total of between $US466.2 million and $US532.8 million.

Underwriters have the option of buying up to an additional 3.3 million shares. That could raise an additional $US69.9 million to $US79.9 million.

Shares would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KING.
