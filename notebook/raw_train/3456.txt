Hong Kong has experienced a notable increase in the number of young mainland Chinese women marrying elderly Hong Kong men to obtain residency, and in many cases, housing.

The South China Morning Post cites the Hong Kong Social Welfare Department reporting an increase in the number of documented elderly abuse cases, from 589 in 2013, 408 in 2012, and a mere 368 from 2011-2010. More specifically, Against Elderly Abuse, a Hong Kong welfare agency, noted a trend of Chinese women in their thirties from Hubei and Hunan provinces marrying public tenants ¡°over 60 years old living on welfare,¡± and cautioned such men to ¡°use caution¡± as such marriages often turn out ¡°too good to be true.¡±

The eagerness of some elderly Hong Kong men to walk down the aisle with much younger Chinese women seems to be against the grain in terms of overall Hong Kongers¡¯ distaste for Chinese, but in line with cross-border male preferences for younger female partners.
