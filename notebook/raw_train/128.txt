Colorado raked in more than $2 million in tax revenue in the first month of recreational marijuana sales.

If sales keep the same pace, revenues will be less than the $70 million projected for the year, the Denver Post reported.

According to the report, the state collected $1.4 million from a special 10 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana and $416,690 from the state's standard 2.9 percent sales tax.

This means that cannabis shops sold more than $14 million in product during the month of January. Most of those sales came out of the city of Denver.

The first $40 million generated from excise taxes are earmarked for a state school construction fund. So far, $195,318 has gone into that fund, the Los Angeles Times reported.

According to the Denver Post, 59 recreational marijuana businesses filed returns in January. That number will continue to grow as a total of 167 stores were approved for marijuana sales by the end of February.

Legalized recreational sales in Washington State will launch in June.
