WASHINGTON, DC (WUSA9) -- Chrysler has issued a recall for about 25,000 SUVs.

There's a problem with the anti-lock system in the 2012 and 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango model years.

The automaker says the fix will improve the feel of the pedal during aggressive braking.

Chrysler says there are no reports of injuries or accidents related to this issue.
