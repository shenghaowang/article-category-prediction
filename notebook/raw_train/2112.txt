The China Gold Association, in contrast, sees domestic demand to buy gold falling this quarter compared to the record level of January-March 2013, according to Bloomberg.

"People bought a lot of gold, and I think demand will start climbing again once the festive and marriage season begin later this year."

Shanghai's local price to buy gold, typically quoted at a premium to the international guide of London settlement, held at a discount of $3.20 per ounce.

Last week's default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. 每 the first non-payment on a regulated bond since the People's Bank took over two decades ago 每 will see the company raise cash by selling foreign assets, press reports say.
