Bruce Berkowitz made clear in letters to the boards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two weeks ago that he believes the companies should be run for the benefit of private shareholders and not just the government.

But those letters raised an intriguing claim that received less attention: Mr. Berkowitz said the companies don¡¯t need to pay the U.S. government its required dividend payments in cash and could instead do so with non-cash payments by issuing more stock to the government. This alternative, he said in an interview, undercuts the government¡¯s entire rationale for controversial changes that it made in 2012 to the companies¡¯ financial support.
