 Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 34 points, or 29.72 points below fair value, to 16,414. S&P 500 futures were off 3.5 points, or 2.59 points below fair value, to 1,874.5. Nasdaq futures were off 3.3 points, or 1.85 points below fair value, to 3,701.
 Freescale Semiconductor (FSL) featured prominently in the headlines Monday after the company confirmed that 20 of its employees were among the 239 passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 that mysteriously went missing over the weekend. Twelve of the passengers were from Malaysia and eight were from China. CNN reported that despite a wide-scale search for the plane and its passengers and crew involving 34 planes, 40 ships and search crews from 10 countries, no signs of the plane have turned up.
 A WSJ.com article published over the weekend said that the flight's disappearance could reignite debates about global air security flaws after the investigation exposed stolen passports and sparked concerns about outdated black box technology.

 Year five of this bull market is now over and S&P Capital IQ's chief equity strategist Sam Stovall says in a morning note that it "won the silver medal" relative to the six other bull markets since WWII that celebrated their fifth birthdays.
 Stovall comments that the S&P 500 rose a cumulative 178% in price from March 9, 2009 through March 7, 2014, second only to the bull market that started in August of 1982, which gained 225%. "Even though outlooks are very different today than they were in 2009, the same question remains: When will it end? As Brooke Benton once sang, 'It's Just a Matter of Time,'" Stovall wrote in his note.
