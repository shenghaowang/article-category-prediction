With two weeks left to register, officials said Monday that Obamacare signups now have hit the 5 million mark, perhaps putting enrollment goals within reach.

Marilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted the milestone on her blog Monday. Tavenner said the 5 million mark was reached over the weekend, a little less than three weeks after CMS officials announced on Feb. 25 they had reached 4 million enrollees. That February mark was reached slightly more than one month after enrollment hit 3 million on Jan. 24.

With the March 31 deadline to enlist in Obamacare, the pace of enrollment clearly is quickening, putting new expectations of 6 million signups now in sight for the Affordable Care Act through public exchanges. The 6 million goal was lowered by the Congressional Budget Office from 7 million after difficulties with HealthCare.gov prompted researchers to rethink the numbers.

A brisk campaign waged by President Obama along with members of his administration hopes to boost enrollment via either a handful of state-run exchanges or the federal HealthCare.gov site. Obama himself has made some unusual appearance in hopes of getting young adults to sign up.

The president last week showed up on the website ¡°Funny or Die¡± with Zach Galifianakis and traded a few barbs with the comic actor as he plugged his signature legislative achievement. Then he showed up on WebMD.com to answer questions from readers.
