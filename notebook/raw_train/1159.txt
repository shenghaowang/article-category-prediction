There certainly have been reasons for investors to feel edgy lately, including weakness in China, plunging oil prices and disappointing retail sales figures.

Those industries closely tied to commodity markets where prices are dropping showed real weakness last month. Stripping out seasonal adjustments, oil and gas drillers laid off more than 2,000 workers in January, wiping out four years of employment gains. The overall mining industry, which includes the oil sector, has shed 146,000 jobs since September 2014.

But jobs in manufacturing, in a reversal from its weakness in the second half of 2015, surged last month, rising by 29,000. The strong dollar and weak export markets in Asia and Europe have hurt factory employment, but some experts suggested that the worst might now be over.

¡°It¡¯s a sign the manufacturing sector may be stabilizing,¡± said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the factory sector in the United States is not nearly the size it once was, it plays an important role in the ups and downs of the business cycle and is a source of better-paying jobs for blue-collar workers who have fared poorly in recent decades.

The construction industry, another source of higher-paying working-class jobs, also held up well, adding 18,000 jobs despite the colder weather in the eastern half of the country.

The overall figures for job creation, as well as the sector-by-sector data, are likely to be revised in future months as more data comes in. The proportion of Americans who are in the labor force, which has been stuck at lows not seen since the late 1970s, ticked up slightly in January.
