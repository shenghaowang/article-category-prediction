Sbarro LLC filed for bankruptcy protection Monday after winning support for a debt-for-equity swap that is intended to speed the restaurant chain through its second trip in Chapter 11 in less than three years.

The company said lenders holding 98% of its debt voted to back the so-called prepackaged plan that entails an exchange of $140 million in debt for control of the reorganized business.
