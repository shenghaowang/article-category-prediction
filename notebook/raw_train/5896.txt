The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.7 percent to the upside after a morning of mixed trade. All major bourses and most business sectors were in positive territory.

Technology surged ahead in afternoon trade to close as the best performing sector, 1.4 percent in the green. British software firm Micro Focus led the sector and was trading second on the Stoxx 600, pushing up in afternoon trade to close 7.6 percent higher.

Several other sectors, including banks and insurance, closed above 1 percent.

Oil and gas stocks swung lower in late afternoon deals, despite hovering at around 0.5 percent earlier in the day. The sector closed just 0.18 percent higher, despite oil prices supported by exacerbated geopolitical tension in the Middle East. London-based offshore contractor Subsea 7 was the top performer in the sector after RBC Capital Markets upgraded its stock recommendation to "perform" from "underperform." Its shares closed over 4.8 percent higher.

By contrast, basic resources rose in the last few hours of trade after a morning of losses, closing 0.72 percent in the green. Imerys was the worst performer in the sector after its U.S. unit, Imerys America Talc, and Johnson & Johnson were ordered to pay $117 million in damages by a New Jersey state court on Wednesday.

The food and beverages sector was the poorest performer, down approximately 0.3 percent. Heineken Holding fared the worst, ending the day 1.2 percent lower.
