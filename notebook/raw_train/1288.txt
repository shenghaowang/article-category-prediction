Would say be careful. If it sounds to good to be true that¡¯s because it is.

Typical issues of FBA are lost stock, high and varied shipment costs, no respect for your items, inability to book items in correctly. Having used FBA for 3 years it has now become extremely costly. The fees change all the time. When they do the scan for a new product you get one shipment cost and then later if you add another variation it magically is more expensive even though identical packaging and weight.

Just had a load of stock returned as we pulled the line to sell elsewhere and to be honest if I received one of these items I would send it back. All need repackaging. There is no care for products.

Currently we have issues with a delivery that was not checked in correctly with over 30 mid cost items that are missing also have many products stranded in France which no one seems to be able to find. Seller support are useless and after 3 weeks there is still no sign of my stock.

Cost of shipping goods via the Amazon preferred supplier UPS has now increased again, this keeps changing. We are slowly moving away from FBA except for some larger products that are actually cheaper to send via this service.

Our sales actually went down we now sell less via Amazon than we ever have (from over 200 orders a month to less than 100). All other channels we sell on have seen a steady increase in line with predictions however within the space of a few months our sales dropped massively. Amazon tell us we have no problems with our account!! Our own site which until recently had no money spent on it sells almost as much as Amazon. So definitely cant say it improved our sales!!

It isn¡¯t going to make a 500% increase in your sales unless you have exactly the right product.

Test a few items and see how you get on would be my advice but don¡¯t expect miracles.

We would not recommend though.
