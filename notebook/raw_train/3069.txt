Fed risks falling 'behind the curve', Charles Plosser says

As the US economy continues its recovery and the US Federal Reserve nears its 6.5 per cent threshold for the unemployment rate, the central bank needs to be less vague about what it is trying to achieve through its policy framework of forward guidance and runs the risk of falling "well behind the curve".



Since the onset of the financial crisis, the Fed shifted to a more 'interventionist' approach, versus a more 'rules-based' system, which could conceivably 'backfire', the President of the Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia, Charles Plosser, said in a speech delivered Monday morning at the French central bank.



The reason why the current 'interventionist' bias might backfire is that it could negatively affect economic agents decisions if it leads them to conclude that the central bank not only expects rates to be lower for longer but that it also expects the economy to be 'weaker for longer'. 



Also, the current communications policy is inconsistent with the Feds innate preference for maintaining policy discretion. Yet for an interventionist scheme to succeed - by lowering long-term nominal interest rates - it requires a commitment to deviate from what the Fed would otherwise do under more normal circumstances.



Pointing to the improvement in hiring seen throughout 2013, in comparison to the previous year, and given his expectation for less 'fiscal drag' over the course of 2014, Plosser believes the economy is now on a sounder footing and is on course to expand by 3%, in line with the Federal Reserve's base scenario.



However, that means that later this year the economy will be growing at a clip that argues in favour of tighter monetary policy instead of simply for a stop to increased accommodation, when the tapering of quantitative easing comes to a stop, the central banker explained. 



As such, Plosser seems to be calling for the pace of tapering to be increased.



Furthermore, in Plossers opinion, forward guidance ought to be more about providing greater clarity as to the rationale behind the Feds thinking.
