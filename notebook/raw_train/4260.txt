The Starbucks app will soon let you tip your barista and shake to pay. Customers will be able to add a tip ranging from $0.50 to $2 to their purchase. If you have tipper¡¯s remorse, you can adjust your tip up to 2 hours after the fact.

¡°Shake to pay¡± is a new feature that quickly pulls up your Starbucks card from anywhere within the app. If you¡¯re in line checking your rewards points and realize you¡¯re about to pay, give your phone a shake to pull up your card.

The Starbucks app is only available to Android and iOS users at the moment but Windows Phone users may not have to wait much longer. Starbucks is apparently working on a Windows Phone version of the app. The Twitter account for My Starbucks Idea, a verified account, says ¡°The team is working on something for this. Stay tuned.¡±

It¡¯s not surprising Starbucks wants to bring the app to more platforms. The app currently has over 10 million active users and accounts for 11% of all Starbucks transactions.

The updated app will be rolling out March 19th in the US, UK, and Canada.
