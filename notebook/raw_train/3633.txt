China aims to cut energy intensity by 3.9 percentage, which is equivalent to cutting coal burning by 220 million tonnes, says Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

He made the remark at a press conference Thursday following the closing meeting of the second session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2014.

With the growing public complaint about China's severe air pollution, Li has said in his work report that the government will "declare a war" against pollution, including smog, which is the first time that the country's top leadership used such words.

"What we mean is to declare a war against our extensive production and living pattern. Last year, we promulgated ten measures to control air pollution and monitor PM2.5 in 161 cities. On one hand, it aims to improve people's awareness, on the other hand, it urges related authorities to take their responsibilities more seriously." Li further explained to the press.

The government says it will severely punish those who emit pollutants illegally. Likewise, supervising authorities must be accountable if they turn a blind eye on polluting activities or fail to perform their duties.

"It takes time to tackle this problem, but we can't wait for wind and rain to drive smog away. I hope that our government, businesses and each and every individual will act together and make persistent efforts to win this battle." Li said.
