The current circular design is being done away with and a new, retro style 12-sided coin based on the Threepenny bit will be put into circulation from 2017 ¨C and it is said to be the hardest in the world to fake.

Described as a "giant leap into the future" the new coin will replace the old one, after the Treasury announced that 3% in circulation are fake - a total of over 45 million.

The coin is based on the historic three pence piece, which was the first coin to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But unlike its predecessor, the new coin - which will be roughly the same size as the existing one when introduced in 2017 - will contain technological advances that make it difficult to forge.
