WHAT IT MEANS: The Federal Reserve is meeting next week and the Job Openings and Separations report is supposed to be one of Chair Janet Yellen's favorite indicators. It provides a look not only at what firms are doing but also at the behavior of workers. On the business side, while hiring did slow a bit in January, the deceleration was hardly due to an unwillingness to add workers. Indeed, job openings soared and are up sharply over the year. While available positions jumped by 7.6% between January 2013 and January 2014, the pace of hiring increased by only 3.3%. That points to a backlog in hiring that should start showing up. Similarly, in the March National Federation of Independent Businesses survey, it was reported that "40 percent of the respondents indicated that there were few or no qualified candidates for open positions" and "Twenty-two (22) percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period". Demand for workers is building and it is just a matter of time when the openings get filled. As for worker perceptions of conditions, a look at the quit rates points to growing confidence that jobs are becoming more readily available. While the number of quits was off in January, it was up solidly over the year. People haven't been leaving their jobs for a long time for fear of not finding another one. Now they are doing that, especially in professional and business services, where the number rose by 33% and in retail, where it was up by 16%.
