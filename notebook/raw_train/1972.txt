The deadline to enroll for Affordable Care Act health benefits is fast approaching. To get covered through state or federal health exchanges starting this year, most will need to enroll by March 31, 2014.

Maybe you¡¯re on the fence about signing up for ACA insurance. Is it worth it? Will you be able to get the kind of coverage you need? Do medical offices know how to deal with ACA billing? Is HealthCare.gov a glitchy nightmare?

Smart consumers know to read up on any big purchase before buying, so we asked Marketplace listeners to give us their ¡°user reviews¡± of being insured under the Affordable Care Act. Here¡¯s what some of them had to say:

Jan in El Cajon, CA says she¡¯s been pretty disappointed with what the Affordable Care Act has had to offer her 27-year-old daughter:

Jen in Collingswood, NJ says she¡¯s generally satisfied with the affordability of the ACA plans, and hasn¡¯t run into much trouble using her benefits:

And Cameron in Seattle, WA wishes the ACA offered drastically different coverage options than traditional plans, but she does appreciate how affordable it¡¯s made her medications:

We also asked people to write their ACA user reviews on Facebook:
