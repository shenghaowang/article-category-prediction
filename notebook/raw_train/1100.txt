Copper sank to 8-1/2 month lows on Monday, dropping steeply for a second session, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped after a surprise fall in China's exports heightened fears of an economic slowdown.



China's exports fell 18.1 percent in February from a year ago, confounding market expectations for an increase.



Chinese commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Shanghai copper sliding 5 percent, rubber by more than 4 percent and Dalian iron ore futures by nearly 6 percent. China's equities sank to a five-year low.
