NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq up for the first session in five, as investors grappled with the evolving situation in Ukraine but shrugged off concern over weakness in China¡¯s economy.

London copper prices, a proxy for economic health due to the metal¡¯s broad industrial use, hit their lowest since July 2010 on concerns about credit problems in China, but later rebounded. Copper has fallen 7.7 percent over four sessions. Spot gold hit a six-month high on its safe-haven appeal.

¡°The situation in Ukraine and a slowing China are going to matter, but they haven¡¯t mattered yet. Commodity prices are falling and that is tied to demand,¡± said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

However, money is on the sidelines. Investors, worried about missing another leg up in the five-year U.S. equity bull market, are keeping indexes near recent highs.

¡°People think they missed out and the market is going to do the same it did last year,¡± she said. ¡°There¡¯s more retail money flowing into the system, supporting stocks.¡±

Geopolitical developments have moved to the forefront this week on a lack of major corporate results and market-moving economic data. The S&P 500 rose 30 percent last year and, after a recent decline, hit a record high last Friday.

¡°We¡¯ve climbed so far, to continue to climb is definitely going to be a see-saw move,¡± said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
