FXStreet (¨®d) - Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said today in a speech delivered at the Bank of France alongside Governor Christian Noyer that he expected US unemployment to drop even lower than 6.2% by the end of the year.



The voting FOMC member suggested that the last three Nonfarm Payrolls monthly readings were weaker due to the ¡°effect of the unusually severe winter weather,¡± but that he expected the US labor market to improve from now on. 



He also suggested that the US economy would expand by around 3% this year and that upside risks to inflation existed in the longer term.



Plosser, a critic of the Fed's quantitative easing program, also expressed hope that the central bank's monetary policy would return to ¡°normalcy¡± as soon as possible.
