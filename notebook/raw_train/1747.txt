The complex financial manoeuvre will create the effect of a two-for-one stock split and dramatically reduce the voice of Google's common shareholders

But it will also change how the company is reflected in the value of the popular S&P 500 index. The share price will be cut in half from Wednesday's lofty per-share level of $1,207.30 , but investors will see their ability to have a say in the company greatly reduced.

The changes kick off on April 2, when Google will, using newly created class C stock, pay a dividend to existing holders of the company's class A and class B shares. The new class C shares will carry no voting rights, making them unusual relative to the common shares issued by most companies.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has reversed course on the way it will deal with the situation in the S&P 500. Originally, the index provider was going to replace Google's class A shares in the index with class C. But late Tuesday, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would include both the class A and the class C shares, meaning the S&P 500 will now have 501 stocks in it, representing 500 companies.
