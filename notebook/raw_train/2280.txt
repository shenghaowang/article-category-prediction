Vodafone has agreed to buy Spain¡¯s largest cable operator Ono in a deal worth just over 6 billion.

The acquisition, funded in part by the proceeds from the sale of its US arm, will see Vodafone take on 1.9 million customers, and create a stronger challenger to Spanish market leader Telefonica.

The deal for private equity-owned Ono is Vodafone¡¯s third purchase of a European fixed-broadband business in two years and will enable it to offer fixed-line and mobile services, pay-TV and broadband. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said the deal represented an ¡°attractive value creation opportunity for Vodafone¡±.

The agreement, which comes as the French market undergoes a similar transformation, could also spark more consolidation within Spain as players such as France¡¯s Orange seek out acquisitions to avoid falling behind. According to the Spanish regulator, Vodafone had almost 25 per cent of the mobile market there. The deal, which includes Ono¡¯s 1.1 million mobile customers, is likely to increase that by almost 2 percentage points. Orange has around 23 per cent of the market.

Ono, which had been in the process of preparing for a stock market flotation, has a network that covers 70 per cent of Spanish households.
