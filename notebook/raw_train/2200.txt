30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates climbed by double digits on the latest Zillow Mortgage Marketplace ticker, owing to a number of variables including an upbeat employment report.

According to Zillow, 30-year fixed mortgages added ten basis points from the previous week, climbing from 4.11 percent to 4.21 percent. Interest rates had actually peaked at 4.27 percent as of Monday, March 10, before settling at 4.21 percent as of yesterday. Rates for 15-year fixed mortgages, on the other hand, closed at 3.15 percent, while 5/1 adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, were at 2.74 percent yesterday. Compared to last year¡¯s figures, mortgage rates remain significantly higher than they were, though not as high as their levels in the late summer months of 2013.

¡°Rates rose on Monday to levels not seen since mid-January, as the situation in Ukraine appeared to improve and Friday¡¯s jobs report beat expectations,¡± said Zillow director of mortgages Erin Lantz, explaining the variables that caused this week¡¯s upticks. She added that for the coming week, rates should be ¡°fairly steady¡±, unless economic data released in the latter half of the week is ¡°strong enough to accelerate the gradual upward momentum¡± that had followed after the release of Friday¡¯s employment statistics.
