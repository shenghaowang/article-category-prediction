The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($453,100 or less) increased to its highest level since April 2011, 4.97 percent from 4.88 percent, with points increasing to 0.47 from 0.44 (including the origination fee) for loans with 20 percent down payments.

"Rates rose last week as investors looked past US-China trade tariffs and towards this week's Fed meeting," said Joel Kan, an MBA economist. "Treasury yields increased 8 basis points for the week, as the growth outlook for the US remained positive, and data on housing starts and home sales showed a reprieve after a few months of weak results."

Mortgage applications to purchase a home also rose 3 percent for the week and were 4 percent higher compared with the same week one year ago. More listings are finally coming onto the market, which may be helping to boost sales. Home prices are still very high and continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than they did earlier this year.

Given the high demand for housing, mortgage volume should be considerably higher, but rising mortgage rates are eating away at already strained affordability. Freddie Mac is now forecasting total sales for 2018 will be slightly lower than last year.

"Unfortunately, too many would-be buyers continue to be tripped up by not enough affordable supply and the one-two punch of much higher home prices and mortgage rates," said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. "Prospective buyers are being squeezed the most where demand is the strongest: the entry-level portion of the market. While price appreciation is welcomingly starting to ease in many markets, weakening affordability continues to hamper overall activity."
