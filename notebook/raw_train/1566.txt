Photos have appeared on a Chinese government website showing what could be floating debris from the plane. The images were taken one day after the aircraft vanished.

The unconfirmed objects were found in the vicinity of where the plane with 239 people board disappeared on its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

China is losing patience with Malaysian efforts to coordinate the search and has demanded more accurate information about the missing plane.

Vietnam¡¯s military has said the area where the photos were taken will be searched once more.
