Premier Li Keqiang says China can accommodate economic growth lower than its stated target of 7.5 per cent and signalled the government is comfortable with the "hardly avoidable" prospect of debt defaults within the nation's risky shadow banking sector.

Speaking at the closing press conference of the National People's Congress in Beijing on Thursday, China's No.2 leader said he was confident in the health of the country's economy, and that bearish talk of a 'hard landing' had consistently been proven wrong.

Mr Li conceded the "downward pressure" on the economy was the toughest challenge he faced last year, and said the challenge may prove even harder this time round as China continues to push through a painstaking restructuring of its economy.

"There is no denying we may encounter a more complex situation this year," he said, raising the difficult balancing act of maintaining jobs growth, keeping inflation in check, alleviating environmental problems, all while improving the efficiency and quality of China's economic growth.

"We need to strike a proper balance among all these goals and objectives."
