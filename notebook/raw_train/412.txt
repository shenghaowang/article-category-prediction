China's yuan weakened against the U.S. dollar Monday after the central bank doubled the currency's daily trading band. The WSJ's Jake Lee talks to CIBC's Asia strategist about the effects this move will have on the yuan.

BEIJING¡ªChina sent one of its strongest signals yet that it is pressing ahead on revamping its financial sector, despite a slowing economy, by further loosening its grip on the tightly tethered yuan.

Starting Monday, the yuan will be able to trade as much as 2% on either side of what is known as the parity rate, a daily peg for trading of the yuan against the U.S. dollar that is set by the central bank. Until now, the People's Bank of China had allowed investors to push the yuan's value 1% in either direction of parity.
