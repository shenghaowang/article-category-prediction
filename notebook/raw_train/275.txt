Asian markets tumbled following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.

"It's hard to ignore a number that looks like that," said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.

While authorities blame the country's holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness.

In Japan the government said Monday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2 per cent in the quarter to December and 1.5 per cent through 2013, slower than first thought.
