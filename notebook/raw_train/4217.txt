The Australian dollar is lower as increased political tension in eastern Europe spoils the market's appetite for riskier assets.

At 1200 AEST on Wednesday, the local unit was trading at 92.95 US cents, down from 93.34 cents on Tuesday.

Russia has reportedly increased its military presence on the Ukraine border, suggesting a possible escalation in the conflict.

Western Union Business Solutions currency strategist Steven Dooley said the possibility of Russian troops moving into Ukraine had encouraged a move into haven assets.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is an ongoing and increasing humanitarian crisis in east Ukraine, which is the kind of language you'd expect just before they roll in the tanks," Mr Dooley said.

"That's one of the mains reasons we've seen weakness in the market."

Mr Dooley said the Australian dollar in the past couple of days mainly had been driven by market sentiment rather than US interest rate expectation.

"This is a bit of a short-term movement back into risk-on risk-off. I think it will soon go back to the major theme, being US interest rate policy," he said.

"But six months down the track it will go back to risk-on risk-off."

Local investors are waiting for the release of Australian employment data for July, due out on Thursday.

The number of people with jobs is expected to rise by 12,000 in July and the unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at six per cent, an AAP survey of 15 economists found.

Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was weaker.

At 1200 AEST on Wednesday, the September 2014 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 96.510 (implying a yield of 3.490 per cent), down from 96.530 (3.470 per cent) on Tuesday.

The September 2014 three-year bond futures contract was at 97.290 (2.710 per cent), level with the previous local close.
