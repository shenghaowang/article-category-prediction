Patrick Drahi, CEO of Luxembourg-based investment fund Altice Group, has reportedly said that he will not raise his bid for Vivendi¡¯s telecoms arm SFR, according to French newspaper Les Echos. The executive was cited as saying: ¡®The offer I¡¯ve made has been valid since 5 March. I have no reason to modify it.¡¯

As previously reported by TeleGeography¡¯s CommsUpdate, last week Vivendi received two bids for France¡¯s second largest mobile provider in terms of subscribers, from domestic broadband operator Numericable, majority owned by Altice Group, and Bouygues Telecom; both suitors have valued SFR at around EUR19billion¨CEUR20 billion (USD26.08 billion¨CUSD27.45 billion). Numericable has tabled a bid which consists of EUR11 billion in cash (comprising EUR8 billion in debt and EUR3 million via a capital increase) and 32% of the new merged entity. For its part, Bouygues Telecom¡¯s proposal comprises EUR10.5 billion in cash and 46% of the share capital of the new entity. Further, Bouygues Telecom has promised to stage an initial public offering (IPO) for the new company ¡®as soon as possible¡¯, with Vivendi given the opportunity to sell an additional 15% stake in the enlarged company.
