When unassigning my till, sometimes something pops up saying ¡°digital tip payout¡± and every time i hit okay it says i am not authorized. Anyways, today it popped up again and i hit okay twice which it went through but one of my coworkers said that i was shorting our tips by not taking money out of the register and putting it in the tip jar? I¡¯m confused. I¡¯ve never been told this before since i started in April... is this true? this person is a 5 year partner so they know more than me but??? I¡¯ve never heard of taking out money from the registers to get digital tips?
