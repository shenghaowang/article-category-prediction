Customer here. Just out of curiosity, how does it work when I tip via the app? Does the tip go directly to the person that rang me up, or is it shared among the team? Do you get cash at the end of the day or is it put into your paycheck and taxed? Do you prefer me to drop cash in the jar to using the app to tip? Thanks!

P. S. - Keep up the great work. Every time I get Starbucks it makes my day.
