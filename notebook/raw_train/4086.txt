The Australian stockmarket looks set to open lower after Wall Street finished mixed as a better-than-expected United States jobs report helped offset anxiety over Ukraine that sent European equities lower.

At 645am (AEDT), the March share price index futures contract was down 16 points at 5,456.

The monthly US jobs report said the economy added 175,000 jobs in February, an improvement after jobs growth had plummeted the previous two months.

But Ukranian tensions continued with a threat from Russian gas company Gazprom to halt deliveries to Ukraine.

No major local economic or equities news is expected on Monday.

In Australia, the market on Friday ended the week with a slight gain as investors remained unfazed by Russia's incursion into Ukraine and drew comfort from local economic data.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 16.4 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,462.3 points.

The broader All Ordinaries index added 17.3 points, or 0.32 per cent, at 5,477 points.
