Malaysia has requested help from an additional 11 countries in the search for MH370, the Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight that mysteriously disappeared after takeoff over a week ago. There are now 25 countries involved in the search effort, including the US, France, China, Australia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, India, Myanmar, and others in Asia.

"The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort," Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a briefing today. "It has now become even more difficult."

The search area is now massive, spanning the borders of 11 nations and the Indian Ocean, which has poor radar coverage. "It is our hope with the new information, parties that can come forward and narrow the search to an area that is more feasible," Hussein said.

The plane continued to ping satellites for hours after losing communication, suggesting that it did not wreck. Investigators now suspect the plane may have been hijacked, or the pilots may have deliberately set a new course. They searched the homes of the two pilots as other countries were asked to look into the backgrounds of their citizens who were on board.

Authorities have not ruled out any possibilities, reports the Associated Press. It's possible, however, that the plane may never be found.
