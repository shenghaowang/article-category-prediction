The flight left at 5:30 p.m. from Orlando International Airport, but McDuff did not know when the panel popped off the right wing. The flight landed about 7: 30 p.m. at Hartsdale-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

None of the 179 passengers and six crew members suffered injury, according to Delta spokeswoman Lindsay McDuff.

An investigation is underway to determine why a wing panel fell off a Boeing 757 passenger jet Sunday on an afternoon Delta Air Lines flight from Orlando to Atlanta.

"It looks like the entire panel came off," according to Associate Professor Chuck Horning, chairman of the Department of Aviation Maintenance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach. "One of the first things they will probably do is look at the maintenance logs to see when it was last removed."

Having looked at a photograph taken by a passenger on the flight, Horning said the sizable panel came from the forward edge of the right wing close to the fuselage. Made of plastic composite material with a honeycomb core, the light-weight panel provides access to the right landing gear assembly and is attached to the wing structure with screws.

Besides routine maintenance, passenger jets commonly undergo complete overhauls about every 10 years.

"It does happen that panels do come off an airplane but it's not an everyday occurrence," Horning said.

A check of the federal Aviation Safety Reporting System maintained by NASA did not show any panels lost in flight in recent years. Much more common were incidents of flight crew fatigue, equipment failures and navigational errors.

The Boeing 757 first went into service in the 1980's but there was no information on when that particular aircraft was built. More than 1,000 of the twin-engine jets were built before the model went out of production in 2005.
