(Kitco News) - Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with modest gains Monday, supported on short covering by the shorter-term traders and on some bargain hunting. There may have been a bit of fresh safe-haven buying enter the gold market Monday, as news reports said more Russian troops were moving into Ukraine. April gold was last up $2.70 at $1,341.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $1.20 at $1,341.25. May Comex silver last traded down $0.043 at $20.885 an ounce.

The situation in Ukraine is presently simmering somewhere between the front burner and back burner of the market place. However, reports Monday said that additional Russian troops have been moved to the Crimea region of Ukraine. Russian president Putin did turn up the heat a bit over the weekend when he said he would back the Crimean region seceding from Ukraine. U.S. and German officials rebuked Putin over the weekend. A vote on the Crimean secession is scheduled for March 16, and that could be the flashpoint in the region. This matter will likely limit selling pressure in gold for at least the near term.

There was downbeat economic data coming out of China over the weekend. Its exports fell by 18% in February, year-on-year, it was reported Saturday. A 5% increase in exports was expected from the world¡¯s second-largest economy in February. China¡¯s trade deficit in February was $23 billion, compared to a $32 billion surplus in January. This surprising news put pressure on Asian and European stock markets, as well as the raw commodity sector, to start the trading week. The news also limited the upside in gold and silver markets Monday.

The Malaysian airliner that went missing over the weekend is not being credited with significantly moving markets, but the specter of terrorism being at blame is unsettling.

The London P.M. gold fix is $1,344.00 versus the previous P.M. fixing of $1,335.25.
