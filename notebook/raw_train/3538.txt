Employers posted more job openings in January despite cold and stormy weather, though hiring slowed slightly.

The number of job openings rose 1.5% to 3.9 million and was close to November's five-year high, the Labor Department said Tuesday.

Hiring dipped to 4.54 million from 4.58 million in December. While openings generally have returned to pre-recession levels, hiring is still lagging.

The number of available jobs and hiring held up fairly well in January despite a slowdown in job growth that some economists have partly attributed to unusually cold and stormy weather. The economy added just 129,000 jobs in January, turning in weak gains for the second straight month. Last week, the government said employers added 175,000 jobs in February.

Hiring picked up in professional and business services, construction and education and health. It fell in manufacturing, retail and trade, transportation and utilities.

The number of people quitting jobs slipped a bit in January for the second straight month. Quitting is evidence of a vibrant job market because it shows hiring is strengthening enough for more people to leave existing positions.

The number of layoffs, meanwhile, rose by 34,000 to 1.74 million.

Overall, the labor market has improved markedly since the recession. There were 2.57 unemployed people for every job opening in January, down from 2.64 in December and 3.33 in January 2013. The January ratio is only slightly higher than the average 2.18 unemployed people per job opening from 2002 to 2006, according to Labor and Barclays Capital.
