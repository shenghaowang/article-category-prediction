General Motors said on Wednesday that it had received reports as early as 2001 ¡ª three years earlier than previously disclosed ¡ª of a safety defect in its cars that the company has now linked to 12 deaths and at least 31 accidents over the past decade.

In an expanded chronology of events filed with federal safety regulators about the recall of 1.6 million cars, the automaker said that during the development of the Saturn Ion in 2001 it had found that the ignition switch could turn off easily, but that a design change ¡°had resolved the problem.¡±

Then, in 2003, an internal inquiry said that a service technician observed the car stall after the ignition had switched off while driving. After seeing that a heavy key ring had worn out the switch, the technician replaced it, the chronology said, and the inquiry was then closed. (In documents released on Tuesday, G.M. lowered the number of deaths tied to the faulty switch to 12 from 13, saying it had mistakenly counted one fatality twice.)

In its first version of the chronology, filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Feb. 24, G.M. said it had learned in 2004 that if a driver bumped the ignition switch in a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, it could turn off, shutting the engine.
