NEW YORK (PIX11) ¡ª After another fatality along Metro-North Railroad tracks, the agency¡¯s new safety protocols are being reviewed and questioned.

Metro-North says James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital after he was struck by a passenger train while working near 106th Street on the Park Avenue viaduct shortly before 1 a.m Monday morning. He had worked with the railroad for eight years.

He was working with a crew assigned to restoring power to track that had been closed for the weekend.

The railroad says he was struck at 12:54 a.m. by the 12:47 a.m. train en route to Poughkeepsie, on its regular schedule. Why the crew was along this certain section of track is being investigated.

Senator Charles Schumer held a press conference at Grand Central Terminal to question the safety improvements the MTA has put in place.

Senator Schumer said he did not think a federal take over of the railroad is an option to discuss now.

The NTSB and the FRA are investigating the incident along with Metro-North and the MTA Police Department.

¡°The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff¡¯s family,¡± said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti.

¡°Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad. With our partners at the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, we will re-examine our procedures and protocols to ensure we are performing our jobs with safety as the paramount concern.¡±
