Herbalife Ltd. reiterated Monday that William Ackman's allegation its business is a pyramid scheme has no merit, following a New York Times story about the hedge-find manager's push for lawmakers to investigate the nutritional-supplements maker.

The comments are the latest volley in a public battle between the company and the activist hedge fund manager from Pershing Square Capital Management LP, who disclosed in December 2012 that he had taken a $1 billion short position in Herbalife.
