Andy Greenberg just did a piece on Forbes with regards to hackers claiming to have hacked the Mt.Gox servers. The recent bankruptcy of the Bitcoin exchange has many up in arms and some are deciding to get answers on their own. Some of the data released and posted on Reddit has already been taken down. Greenberg reached out to disgraced Mt.Gox C.E.O. Mark Karpeles but has yet to get a reply back.

The Bitcoin community has been angrily pressing for details on what the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users¡¯ bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox¡¯s staff isn¡¯t talking. So another group of hackers say they¡¯ve broken into the company¡¯s servers to provide answers of their own.

On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox¡¯s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. ¡°It¡¯s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,¡± wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be ¡°goxed¡±¨Cto suffer from Mt. Gox¡¯s technical glitches.
