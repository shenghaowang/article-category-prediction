 The Health Insurance Marketplace will make it easier to shop for health plans in Michigan. All plans will be listed in one place, so consumers can make apples-to-apples comparisons of the benefits and prices. And all plans are required to describe what¡¯s included in simple language, so there¡¯s no guesswork about what¡¯s covered.

 The health insurance plans must cover the essentials. All plans offered on the Marketplace are required to cover important benefits, like doctor visits, emergency care, prescriptions, preventive care and more.

 For the first time, there¡¯s financial help to pay for health insurance. Now, health coverage is finally within reach for millions of Americans. In fact, many people who buy their plan on the Marketplace can get help covering the costs. And low-cost or free plans are available depending on your income.
