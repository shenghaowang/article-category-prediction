In another sign of continued pressures facing the fast-food industry, McDonald¡¯s Corp. on Monday reported disappointing monthly same-store U.S. sales, its fourth-straight month of declines despite its aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games where it plugged products like its $5 20-piece chicken nuggets.

Like retailers across the board, McDonald¡¯s /quotes/zigman/233369/delayed /quotes/nls/mcd MCD again cited weather as a negative factor. But that¡¯s not all. The absence of real per capita disposable income growth that has hurt retailers like Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT also has hurt restaurant chains like McDonald¡¯s, analysts said. The company also has faced increased competition from fast-casual chains including Chipotle /quotes/zigman/395806/delayed /quotes/nls/cmg CMG and Panera /quotes/zigman/65095/delayed /quotes/nls/pnra PNRA . More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald¡¯s struggling to make itself relevant for today¡¯s consumers.

According to the National Restaurant Association¡¯s 2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year¡¯s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.

¡°The U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald¡¯s hasn¡¯t kept up,¡± Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.

A case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain Sbarro on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.

To reverse waning demand, McDonald¡¯s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson also is ¡°enhancing the breakfast experience¡± at the chain to create ¡°more of a coffee culture.¡± After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory. It also will be offering a new Bacon Clubhouse sandwich featuring Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The company is also testing giving consumers the ability to customize their orders, taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.

U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters. Overseas, European comparable sales were up 0.6%, while sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, as well as a stronger dollar, which made its food more expensive abroad.

Without the weight of a stronger dollar, total world-wide sales would have risen 2.2% , instead of a 0.6% decline in February, the company said.

Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald¡¯s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.

¡°We believe the current more challenging reality is reflected in valuation,¡± said Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein, who rates the stock overweight. ¡°While not the strongest near-term performer, we expect

 MCD to regain lost U.S. share in ¡®14, and benefit from a European macro recovery.¡±

McDonald¡¯s shares dipped 0.4% to $95.11 Monday morning. They are down 3.6% during the past year, the third-worst Dow performer. In comparison, Chipotle jumped 82%, while Panera is up 11%, during the same period.
