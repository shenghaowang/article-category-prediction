FTSE 100 finished not far off a record closing high as the pound weakened amid the backdrop of a first interest rate rise by the for over a decade.

The index of UK blue chip shares closed up around 67 points at 7,555.

On October 12 this year, it made a new high, finishing that day at 7,556 - a gain of 0.3% on the day.

The Bank raised rates to 0.50% from 0.25% but it was widely expected. It said future increases would be at a ¡®gradual pace and to a limited extent¡¯.

Sterling fell heavily on Thursday, shedding 1.87% against the Euro and tumbling 1.54% against the US dollar at the time of writing.

Laith Khalaf at noted: "The FTSE 100 has ended the day within a whisker of a record high, with the falling pound helping to drive up the share prices of the international companies in the benchmark index."

He added: "The market has delivered yet another salutary lesson on why not to invest on the basis of macro-economic events like an interest rate rise."

The analyst noted that, in theory, the interest rate rise should have been positive for the pound and the banking sector, and negative for gilts and the FTSE 100 but the pound fell, as did Lloyds ( ) and RBS ( ) shares, while gilts and the broader Footsie rallied, turning the investment textbook on its head.

"This is largely because markets wanted more than a rate rise from the Bank of England today, and were pricing in a more hawkish stance on the future path of monetary policy.

"As things now stand, it looks like we¡¯re only going to get two rate rises in the next three years," he said.

3.45pm: Summary of events so far today

The FTSE 100 continued to jump ahead of the close as the pound dropped after the raised interest rates for the first time in a decade but said future hikes would be gradual.

Sterling fell 1.27% against the dollar to US$1.3077 and declined 1.47% versus the euro to 1.1231.

The Bank raised rates to 0.50% from 0.25% but it was widely expected and seen by analyst as merely a correction from last year¡¯s cut.

The central bank said future increases would be at a ¡®gradual pace and to a limited extent¡¯ and added that Brexit uncertainty was weighing on domestic activity.

¡°The pound reacted pretty damn violently to all this,¡± said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at .

¡°Even considering the potential damage the rate rise will do to consumer spending, and therefore the health of its retailers, the FTSE revelled in the pound¡¯s fall, surging 50 points to a 2 week peak.¡±

The Bank¡¯s policy decision overshadowed other market developments, including economic data and corporate results.

Markit¡¯s UK construction PMI rose more than expected in October but revealed the industry remains under pressure while the final reading on German manufacturing PMI for October was revised higher.

In the US, initial jobless claims fell in the latest week and beat expectations.

In companies, shares rose after reporting a jump in third quarter earnings.

2.50pm: Bank won't raise rates again until Q4 of 2018, says EY Item Club

EY Item Club¡¯s chief economic advisor Howard Archer thinks it will be some time before the raises interest rates again.

He expects the Bank will hold off on another rate hike until fourth quarter of 2018. At that point he predicts rates will rise to 0.75% from the current 0.50%

¡°There is still little evidence of pay growth picking up despite the tightness of the labour market, and there looks to be a very good chance that inflation will fall back markedly during 2018 as the impact of sterling¡¯s sharp drop over the second half of 2016 increasingly fades. Meanwhile, the economy is still subdued while Brexit uncertainties cloud the outlook,¡± he said.

¡°Furthermore, given that this is the first interest rate hike since 2007, the MPC may well feel a need to sit tight for an extended period to see how consumers and businesses respond.¡±

Across the Atlantic, US data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week.

US initial jobless claims dropped 5,000 from the previous week¡¯s revised level to 229,000, compared to expectations for an increase to 235,000, the Labor Department revealed.

The four-week moving average, which is considered a more reliable measure of jobless claims, fell 7,250 to 232,500 from the previous week's level, which was revised up by 250.

The report comes ahead of the all-important US non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which may influence the Federal Reserve on whether to raise interest rates in December.

Commenting on the ¡¯s interest rate announcement, ETX Capital¡¯s Neil Wilson thinks ¡°this was about as dovish hike as you get¡±.

¡°A hike was telegraphed but what was less certain was whether this would be the start of a tightening cycle or one-and-done,¡± he said.

¡°From the cautious language, it¡¯s more like one and wait-and-see. Further hikes will be ¡®at a gradual pace and to a limited extent¡¯.¡±

Wilson said with Brexit weighing on the outlook, this statement could just as easily be reversed next year.

¡°Brexit poses such a fundamental risk to the economic outlook to some extent the interest rate expectations are somewhat meaningless.¡±

BoE governor Mark Carney said the Bank expects the squeeze on household incomes to ease next year as wage growth picks up and inflation begins to fall.

The governor said there should be a ¡°gradual¡± pick up in real wages as productivity and investments improve.

However, pay rises are still expected to be below historical averages in a couple of years¡¯ time.

1.00pm: Inflation will continue to overshoot Bank's 2% target in 2020, says Carney

The has raised its inflation expectations for this year but cut its forecast for 2018 , and left its estimate for 2019 unchanged.

Carney said even with two rate hikes over the next three years, inflation will continue to overshoot the Bank's 2% target.

The GDP forecast was downgraded for 2017 but maintained for 2018 and 2019.

Governor Mark Carney said the Bank¡¯s forecasts are based on two more interest rate rises over the next three years.

In a press conference after the Bank raised rates to 0.50%, he said the future rate hikes will be needed to bring inflation back to the 2% target.

"The time has come to ease our foot off the accelerator," he said.

Pantheon Economics said the Monetary Policy Committee¡¯s new forecasts imply that markets are ¡°broadly right¡± to expect two further 25 basis point increases in the Bank Rate over the next two years.

12.40pm: FTSE up, pound down in lunchtime trading

The FTSE gained 51 points to 7,539 in lunchtime trading as the pound slumped on a dovish statement by the .

While the Bank has raised rates to 0.50% from 0.25%, this was widely expected and remarks that future increases would be gradual have disappointed the market.

In response, the pound is down 0.96% versus the dollar at US$1.3118 and down 1.23% versus the euro at 1.1259.

¡°The rights and wrongs of the decision will be debated ad infinitum, but it a 25-basis-point increase merely reverses last year¡¯s cut ¨C which was arguably unnecessary ¨C and returns rates to where they¡¯ve been for the entire post-crisis period. So not much has changed,¡± said Ben Brettell, senior economist at .

12.30pm: BoE drops warning that rates may need to rise more than expected

Contributing to the slide in sterling, has dropped its reference in the September meeting minutes that interest rates may need to rise faster than the market expected.

In the meeting minutes, the Bank had said: ¡°If the economy were to follow a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast than the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August Report.

Analysts' reaction to the Bank¡¯s rate hike is that the move was widely expected and is unlikely to rock the boat.

CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said: ¡°While it¡¯s the first rate rise in over a decade, it is only taking the rate back to the level seen in August 2016 and at 0.5% it remains near rock bottom.¡±

Newton-Smith added: ¡°Businesses will be watching the reaction of consumers closely and what¡¯s important is the pace of any future rises. As rates creep up, it¡¯ll be important to keep an eye on the impact for those at the lower end of the income scale.¡±

Investment Director Russ Mould said: ¡°A very gradual series of rate increases looks unlikely to rock the boat too much, at least for now, although if the Bank is right and inflation is coming then investors may need to revise their stock-picking strategy, shifting from growth stocks (like technology) and high-yielding names to more cyclical or value names, like real estate plays or oils and miners, as well as index-linked bonds.¡±

Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, said: ¡°Brexit uncertainty is likely to continue to hold back economic growth in 2018 and if inflation has peaked, the case for further rate rises until the economy is on a firmer footing will be weak to say the least. Another rate rise seems unlikely before the Autumn of 2018.¡±

The has warned that Brexit is having a ¡°noticeable impact on the economic outlook¡±.

¡°The overshoot of inflation throughout the forecast predominantly reflects the effects on import prices of the referendum-related fall in sterling,¡± it said.

The Bank expects inflation will peak above 3% in October as the depreciation of sterling and recent increases in energy prices continue to pass through to consumer prices.

It sees inflation fall back over the next year as the effects of rising import prices on inflation diminish.

The said it still only expects interest rates to rise gradually over the next three years, sending the pound plunging.

¡°All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,¡± the Bank said in a statement.

Sterling fell 0.75% versus the dollar to US$1.3145 and 1.09% versus the euro at 1.1275.

The Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI rose more than expected in October but the report still points to the sector struggling at the start of the fourth quarter after output contracted in the third and second quarters, said EY ITEM Club¡¯s Howard Archer.

He said the PMI of 50.8 marked the second lowest reading since August 2016.

¡°The construction sector¡¯s struggles in recent months points to heightened economic, political and Brexit uncertainties fuelling companies¡¯ caution over committing to new projects,¡± Archer said.

Looking ahead, he added: ¡°Slow economic activity and appreciable economic and political uncertainties threaten to be a highly challenging combination for the construction sector over the coming months. Elevated input costs are adding to the woes of construction companies.

¡°Furthermore, there is the possibility that house building activity could be pressurised by extended lacklustre housing market activity and subdued prices amid weakened consumer fundamentals.¡±

Away from the excitement and in company news, is in the spotlight after reporting its second quarter results.

Shares rose initially as BT maintained its dividend but slipped back 2.63% to 253.65p as investors took a closer look at the quarterly figures.

Profits fell on the costs of rising sports rights while the group is facing a bigger bill to maintain and expand its physical assets and invest in the roll-out of ultra-fast broadband.

¡°This may go some way to explaining why BT wants clarification on how the costs of the nationwide roll-out of superfast broadband can be recovered,¡± said George Salmon, equity analyst at .

Howden Joinery jumped after the British kitchen supplier said it was on track to meet full year expectation and reported an 8.2% rise in total UK depots revenue for the 20 weeks to 28 on October.

UK construction activity expanded October but optimism fell to the lowest level in nearly five years, according to the latest data from Markit/CIPS.

The UK purchasing managers¡¯ index for the construction industry rose to 50.8 in October from 48.1 in September, ahead of economists¡¯ expectations of 48.5. Decline in commercial building and civil engineering were offset by solid growth in residential building on strong demand for housing.

A reading above 50 signals an expansion in sector activity while a level below that indicates a contraction.

¡°Greater house building was the sole bright spot in an otherwise difficult month for the construction sector,¡± said Tim Moore, associate director at Markit and author of the report.

¡°Sustained declines in civil engineering and commercial activity meant that large areas of the building industry have become stuck in a rut.¡±

The index measuring construction firms¡¯ expectations for business activity over the year ahead showed that optimism fell 58-month low in October due to concerns about UK economic prospects and a lack of new projects in the pipeline.

¡°With the lowest optimism since December 2012, purchasing managers blamed a slowdown in work from commercial clients, vanishing civil engineering projects and an increasing weariness over Brexit for the lack of performance, weak pipelines and slowdown in job hires,¡± said Duncan Brock, director of customer relationships at .

If BoE Governor Mark Carney and his fellow Monetary Policy Committee members vote for the increase, it will be the first time in more than a decade base rates have gone up.

As the Guardian¡¯s Markets Live column pointed out, there is a genuine sense of anticipation in the Mile ahead of the midday announcement.

Craig Erlam, market commentator at OANDA, set the scene: ¡°Policy makers will discuss the merits of a rate hike in a bid to prevent inflation moving too far above target - or at least, that's what we're being told despite the acknowledgement that higher inflation is almost entirely down to the one-off currency depreciation that occurred since the Brexit referendum last year.

¡°Inflation reached 3% in September, far above the central bank's 2% target and at the top of the range that the government deems acceptable before Governor Carney must write a letter to the Chancellor explaining why the central bank is failing to achieve its mandated target.

¡°Interestingly, this is also around the level that the central bank expects inflation to peak at which begs the question why they've waited so long to raise interest rates.

¡°Also, why do they now deem it to be the right time to do so before we have a chance to find out how far it will fall again once the initial impact of the currency move falls out of the calculation?¡±
