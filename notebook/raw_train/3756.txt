Meredith Vieira and Lee Woodruff have attended a ceremony honoring the Books for a Better Life organization.

Vieira was the host Monday night and Woodruff was one of the presenters as prizes were given for inspirational books in 10 categories, including cooking, memoir and psychology. Among the winners were Katy Butler's "Knocking On Heaven's Door" for best debut and Todd and Tara Storch's "Taylor's Gift" for best inspirational memoir.

The event was sponsored by the Southern New York Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

Books for a Better Life was established in 1996 and has raised more than $2 million to help people living with MS. Vieira's husband, author Richard M. Cohen, wrote a best-selling book about dealing with it.
