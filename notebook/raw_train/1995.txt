The Prime Rate is the interest rate that banks use as a basis to set rates for different types of loans and lines of credit, with the exception of mortgage rates. Each bank sets its own Prime Rate, although for consumer products most banks will use the U.S. Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal in its column called "Money Rates," and this is the rate shown above. The U.S. Prime Rate is not always the lowest, the best or the favored rate of interest. Banks use different methods to determine what Prime Rate is applicable for each product and when adjustments will be made. Please see your Commerce Banker for more information.
