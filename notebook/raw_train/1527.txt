: Australia stands with Malaysia at this very difficult time following the missing of a Malaysian airliner and will be pleased to take on additional responsibility, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.In a statement emailed to Bernama by the Australian High Commission, Monday, Abbott said he told this to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak during a telephone conversation earlier today.Abbot said Najib called him to update the Australian government on the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370."In the light of developments in the investigation he (Najib) requested that Australia assumes responsibility for co-ordinating that part of the search effort that is now focusing on the southern Indian ocean."I also informed Prime Minister Najib that Australia will make additional maritime surveillance aircraft available to extend the effort to locate MH370.Defence has commenced planning to provide two additional AP-3C Orions within the next 24 hours," he said.Abbott said, Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will take the lead in co-ordinating the search effort in the southern Indian ocean through its rescue co-ordination centre - Australia, supported by the Australian Defence Force and other contributing agencies.He said the two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, which since last week had been assisting the search effort, off the coast of Malaysia, were being retasked to search in the southern Indian ocean."One Orion commenced searching the Indian ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands Sunday. The next sweep will take place this evening as an AP-3C Orion transits from the Cocos Islands to RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia," he said.In assumming overall responsibility for co-ordinating the search effort in the southern Indian ocean, Abbott said, Australia was preparing to work with assets from a number of countries, including surveillance aircraft from New Zealand and the United States.He added that the two AP-3C Orions assisting the Malaysian search effort had flown more than 60 hours on mission since March 9.
