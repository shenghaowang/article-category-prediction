Two weeks out from the ObamaCare enrollment deadline, a new survey shows about one-third of uninsured American have no plans to buy insurance -- despite the law's requirement to do so.

And despite the administration's aggressive campaign to spread the word about the health care law, the same survey shows a startling percentage of people still don't know about the Affordable Care Act's basic provisions.

The report from Bankrate.com was released Monday, in the final stretch of the government's effort to sign people up for coverage. After March 31, some who do not have coverage could face a penalty under the law -- though, in recent weeks, the administration has created wiggle room to let those who have trouble getting insurance avoid a fine.

The Bankrate.com report showed 34 percent of uninsured say they plan to stay uninsured. The most common reason cited was that they consider health insurance to be too expensive. Others are simply opposed to the health care law or think they are healthy enough to go without insurance.

But the poll revealed lingering hurdles for the Obama administration. Seventy-percent of uninsured Americans said they did not know about the law's subsidies, which are meant to defray at least some of the additional costs from buying health insurance.

"This is a staggeringly high percentage," Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman said in a statement

About half also said they hadn't heard about the looming enrollment deadline. This, despite increased efforts by the administration to urge Americans to sign up before March 31.

The poll of 3,005 adults was taken from Feb. 20 to March 9. It had a margin of error of 6.1 percentage points.
