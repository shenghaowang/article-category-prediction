London: World stocks edged off a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude oil tumbled yesterday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine. 



Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease. 



European shares faded through the morning and were back in the red as US trading loomed, and the continued weakness in the DAX and big German firms that sell to Russia offset gains by Portuguese, Italian and Spanish stocks. 



Merger activity in France helped the CAC 40, but mining firms sensitive to China's ferocious appetite for raw materials weighed on London's FTSE 100 as commodities and related currencies lost altitude.
