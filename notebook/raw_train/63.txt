TOKYO (AFP) - Toyota said on Monday it has suspended production at its two Indian auto assembly plants in response to threats against management and "deliberate" assembly-line stoppages, following failed efforts to reach a labour deal.

The world's biggest automaker said the lock-out of about 6,400 employees at the factories in southern India came after "certain sections of the employees...resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors, thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days".
