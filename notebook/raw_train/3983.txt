What strategists are saying

¡°The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)¡¯s decision to hike interest rates from 0.50% to 0.75% today comes as no great surprise¡ªit had been over 90% priced into markets ahead of the meeting. However, the minutes and Inflation Report lend some support to our view that interest rates will rise by more than markets currently expect over the next few years,¡± wrote Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics in a Thursday research note immediately after the decision.
