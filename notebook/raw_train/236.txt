DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White on Tuesday reiterated his concerns about Comcast Corp.'s proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc., though he said the cable deal wouldn't change DirecTV's strategies if completed.

"Clearly there are concerns when the top two cable companies merge," he said Tuesday at a media conference hosted by Deutsche Bank.
