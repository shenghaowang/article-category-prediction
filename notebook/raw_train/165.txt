A mounting clash between Rome and Brussels over the Italian government's spending plans also soured the mood.

Italy's FTSE MIB suffered the most, falling 2.4 per cent to its lowest in more than 17 months as banking stocks came under fresh pressure after Italy's borrowing costs soared further.

Italian banks, whose large government bond holdings makes them sensitive to political risk, declined 3.7 per cent, also weighing on the broader European banking sector.
