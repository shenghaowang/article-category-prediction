The Australian market looks set to open flat after international markets lost ground as investors retreated in the face of concerns about Ukraine, the Chinese economy and falling copper prices.

At 0645 AEDT on Thursday, the March share price index futures contract was down four points at 5,369.

Analysts said falling copper prices had continued the pressure after weak economic data from China.

The fall came a few days after China data showed that the world's second-biggest economy expanded 7.7 per cent last year, the same as in 2012, and the slowest since 1999's 7.6 per cent. It's inflation rate dropped to 2.0 per cent.

It also recorded an unexpected trade deficit of $US22.98 billion ($A25.50 billion) in February, compared to analysts' expectations of a $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Although copper prices have bounced slightly today, the drop through three-year lows yesterday unnerved markets," said Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at trading firm IG.

"Throw in some headlines about Russian movements in Crimea, and you have the recipe for a continuing selloff," he added.

Concern over Russia-Ukraine tension continues with Kremlin-backed forces seizing de facto control of the Crimea peninsula.

In local economic news on Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases February labour force data.

In Australia, the market on Wednesday closed lower, pulled down by weakness in the major banks, even though some mining stocks bounced back from recent losses.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 29.6 points, or 0.55 per cent, at 5,384.2 points.

The broader All Ordinaries index was down 28.8 points, or 0.53 per cent, at 5,400.5 points.

NEW YORK - For much of Wednesday, the US stock market appeared to be headed for its third decline in three days.

By late afternoon, the market began to slowly pare its losses as investors bought up oil refiners, mining companies and technology stocks.

The push was enough to nudge the Standard & Poor's 500 index into the green by half a point. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also finished higher.

The S&P 500 index added 0.57 points, or 0.03 per cent, to close at 1,868.20. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.17 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,340.08.

The Nasdaq composite rebounded in the early afternoon, gaining 16.14 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 4,323.33.

The three major US stock indexes are still down for the week. Stocks had a strong finish last week, setting three record highs.

Investors have been worried this week about a sharp drop in China's exports in February reported over the weekend, which raised concerns that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

Since China is a big consumer of raw materials and energy, commodities such as copper and iron ore have dropped sharply. Copper has fallen to its lowest level since 2010, but recovered somewhat Wednesday.

A dearth of major US economic news helped dampen trading Wednesday, leaving the market listless.

LONDON - Europe's main stock markets have closed down, with mining shares hit hard by renewed worries over China's economic outlook.

The London's FTSE 100 lost 0.97 per cent to 6,620.9 points on Wednesday, the Dax 30 in Frankfurt slumped 1.28 per cent to 9,188.69 points while Paris's CAC 40 ended the day down 1.0 per cent to 4,306.26 points compared with Tuesday's closing values.

"Equity markets have come under pressure around the world as copper prices continue to fall following weak economic data from China," said Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at trading firm IG.

"Although copper prices have bounced slightly today, the drop through three-year lows yesterday unnerved markets.

"Throw in some headlines about Russian movements in Crimea, and you have the recipe for a continuing selloff," he added.

The euro gained to $US1.3910 from $US1.3863 late in New York the day before.

HONG KONG - Asian markets sank, taking their lead from another selloff on Wall Street, while Tokyo took a hit as the yen climbed against the US dollar with profit-takers moving in following last week's greenback rally.

Despite a small pick-up on Tuesday, regional markets followed Wall Street's cues in the wake of the weekend's worse-than-expected trade and inflation data from China and a downward revision to Japanese economic growth in 2013.

Tokyo tumbled 2.59 per cent, or 393.72 points to finish at 14,830.39 and Sydney fell 0.55 per cent, or 29.6 points, to 5,384.2 while Seoul shed 1.60 per cent, or 31.33 points, to 1,932.54.
