Colorado's former top marijuana enforcement official has been hired by a Denver-based marijuana consulting business.

Laura Harris, former director of the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division, is now an advisor to Denver Relief Consulting, an arm of a company that includes a medical marijuana dispensary . Harris, according to Denver Relief's website , will advise clients on regulatory matters.

According to newspaper's report, which was published last July:

"We have control over this division at this point and will continue to have control," Brohl told a legislative committee earlier this year.

Harris is the latest example of the revolving door that's emerged between government and the marijuana industry. In December, I wrote about an Oregon-based federal drug enforcement agent who quit to work in the marijuana industry
