Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced on Tuesday a new program that will allow gamers to trade in used video games for store credit. The world¡¯s largest retailer said the game trade-in program will begin at Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club stores on March 26. Customers will be able to buy the refurbished games in those stores and online later this year.

Currently, Wal-Mart offers trade-ins online, but only in a limited capacity.

¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us, and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡± Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement. ¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They¡¯ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.¡±

The program will allow customers to exchange used games for store credit -- but not cash. Wal-Mart said the trade-in games will be sent out to be refurbished and ¡°made available for purchase in like-new condition.¡±

Games eligible for trade-in must be in their original packaging, and they will be evaluated for damages by electronics department staff. Customers will receive a specific trade-in value for each game, which they can use immediately at any Walmart or Sam¡¯s Club store, or online at Walmart.com and SamsClub.com. USA Today reported that values will vary by game ¡°from just a few dollars for older games to $35 and more for newer ones.¡±

Customers will be able to purchase pre-owned, used video games in stores and online later this year. Games will be marked ¡°Certified Pre-Owned,¡± or ¡°fully refurbished and in like-new condition.¡±

¡°While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we¡¯re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,¡± Mac Naughton said.
