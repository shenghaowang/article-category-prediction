New documents show GM was aware of the problem in 2001 with the Saturn Ion.

General Motors has formally expanded its ignition-switch recall to include vehicles sold in the Canadian market.

The company has begun distributing recall notices to owners of approximately 235,000 vehicles, including certain Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac G5 and Solstice, and Saturn Ion and Sky models.

As the automaker faces a handful of parallel investigations into its handling of the recall, new documents reveal that the company was first aware of the problem in 2001 during preproduction testing of the Saturn Ion.

Previously the issue was said to have been discovered in 2004 with the Chevrolet Cobalt, which already represented a decade of inaction.

Following reports that GM's 2009 bankruptcy effectively absolves the current company from liability in pre-2009 deaths related to the defective switches, the Center for Auto Safety has called on GM to establish a $1 billion victims fund to honor claims that "have been extinguished by the bankruptcy" or by statutes of limitations.

"While GM has said it knows of 13 deaths in 31 crashes with injury, this is just the tip of the iceberg," said CAS executive director Clarence Ditlow in an open letter to GM CEO Mary Barra. "The 13 deaths don't even include Brooke Melton who died in March 2010 and whose family's lawsuit broke the cloak of secrecy this past month."

GM has yet to publicly respond to the CAS call for a victims fund.
