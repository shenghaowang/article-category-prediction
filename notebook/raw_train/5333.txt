Update - Citing a person "close to the board", the New York Times wrote that as well as the lack of pace of innovation at Symantec, the firing had much to do with recent departures at the company. The executive in charge of the cloud business, the CFO the Senior Vice President and the heads of both enterprise and consumer business at Symantec have left since Bennett's appointment. On top of that Symantec has failed to attract new talent as engineers are attracted instead to new competitors such as FireEye and Palo Alto networks as well as to security roles within other technology companies.

One thing that public markets really hate is ongoing executive churn within a company. So the news today that Symantec Corp has fired its president and CEO Steve Bennett, the second such move in less than two years, will cause real concern.

is well known for producing the Norton AntiVirus software, but it's fair to say that the move away from PCs, the increasing use of software subscription models and related lessening appetite for licence-based products alongside the rise of mobile applications have all created a very unstable marketplace for the company. While other companies have seen the mid-term horizon and managed to make some big changes (a good example being Dell which went private in order to have the freedom to embark on a new strategy built on the back of becoming a services-based business), Symantec has been less successful at navigating this path.

The company has been working through a reorganization plan to deal with weak earnings, but reorganization is different from reinvention and this is something that Symantec will come to realize. This is perhaps the rationale for the firing, said Chairman Daniel Schulman;

As a temporary measure, the company has named Michael Brown as interim president and CEO, effective immediately but, at the same time, has begun a search for a permanent replacement. Bennett joined the Symantec board in 2010 after stints at and Intuit. He took the CEO role in July 2012 after the board "requested" that Enrique Salem step down from the role.

As for the interim CEO, Brown joined the board following the merger with Veritas Software in 2005. Previously he served as both chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.

I reached out to Symantec to see what the move means in light of the company's need to truly reimagine what it fundamentally does as a business. Symantec declined to comment and referred me to their press release which, unfortunately for the company, flags some turbulent waters to come, at least in terms of revenue.
