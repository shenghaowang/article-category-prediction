BEIJING, March 13 (Yonhap) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged the United States on Thursday to focus on mutual interests, admitting some "frictions" in their bilateral ties amid tensions with Washington over Beijing's increasingly assertive naval reach in Asia and maritime disputes with its neighbors.

Speaking at his annual press conference, Li, however, gave a relatively upbeat assessment about the prospect of the relationship between the world's top two economies and militaries, saying, "There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of China-U.S. cooperation. We need to make the most of our complementarity."



 China's rise and military modernization have increased tensions with its Asian neighbors at a time when it is embroiled in bitter territorial disputes with Japan and other nations over islands in the East China Sea and South China Sea.
