The big news from overnight in the search for MH370, via the Associated Press:

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. One of the objects spotted was said to be 24 meters (nearly 80 feet) in length and the other 5 meters (about 15 feet) long. Both were in an area that officials described as being about a four-hour flight off Australia's southwestern coast.



The satellite images represent the first significant new lead investigators have had in days, but there is still plenty of reason for caution. This search has already contained more than its fair share of red herrings, including (most notably in this particular case) satellite images released by China in the days after the jetliner went missing that appeared to show debris floating roughly in the area the 777 disappeared from air traffic control radar. A search of that area, however, turned up nothing and investigators have since shifted their attention to the opposite side of the Malaysian peninsula and well beyond.

The new images were actually recorded four days ago！on March 16！but were somewhat lost in the shuffle given the massive scale of the area being searched. "Due to the volume of imagery being searched, and the detailed process of analysis that followed," the info wasn't brought to the attention of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority until Thursday morning local time, according to an official statement from the agency.



Australia quickly dispatched four planes to investigate the area in question！described as a 23,000 square-kilometer area about 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth！but the search produced no debris sightings by the end of the day local time. (The fact that it's a four-hour flight out and a four-hour one back isn't making things any easier for the planes doing the sweep.) The search will begin again Friday morning, according to officials.
