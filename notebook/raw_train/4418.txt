3M Earnings: Is More Pain in Store for MMM Stock?

3M (NYSE:MMM) announces third-quarter 2018 earnings Tuesday before the markets open, and the consensus is that the industrial conglomerate will provide negative guidance for the fourth quarter, sending 3M stock further into negative territory in 2018. Down 15.1% year to date through Oct. 19 and 9.8% over the past year, a negative earnings report is the last thing 3M shareholders want. Is there any hope that MMM will deliver better than expected earnings and won¡¯t guide lower in Q4 and beyond? ¡°Unless the company announces some significant changes to its worldwide portfolio, I figure it¡¯s going to guide down again thanks to the weakness in autos,¡± CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer said Oct. 19.
