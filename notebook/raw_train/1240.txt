Comcast (Nasdaq: CMCSA) Cable President-CEO Neil Smit said today that things will start to move fast once the communications giant has the OK to acquire Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC) because, among other things, "we are very well aligned."

Speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, Smit reportedly said that the two companies "differ slightly" in some areas of the triple play bundle on which Comcast tends to put more focus. Overall, he said, he's spent time with TWC execs and thinks things will work well and happen quickly, according to a story in The Hollywood Reporter.

"Some markets we will go into more aggressively. We intend to go at a fairly quick rate. I would like to see a lot of initiatives rolling out in the first year," he said.

While Smit, like other Comcast executives, sees the merger creating a mammoth force to drive cable television innovation and control prices--while opponents see it driving prices and limiting innovation--one of those most likely to be affected is apparently not sweating the details.

Verizon (NYSE: VZ) CFO Fran Shammo, speaking before Smit came on, said his company isn't overly concerned about a merged giant MSO.

"I'll just compete against Comcast tomorrow," Shammo said. "We're ready to compete."
