An unnamed Silicon Valley billionaire has purchased the world¡¯s most valuable life insurance policy, worth $201m (120m).

The man who cobbled the deal together said it took seven months and 19 insurance companies to put together a deal that surpasses a $100m dollar policy sold to Hollywood mogul David Geffen in 1990.

¡°No one company can afford to take a $201m hit,¡± said Dovi Frances, the financial adviser who represents a ¡°well-known billionaire¡±.

The Guinness Book of World Records announced the surpassing of Geffen¡¯s record on Thursday. Guinness officials spent about three months reviewing records, Mr Frances said. ¡°It was worse than any audit you can think of,¡± he said.

Guinness credits Mr Frances with the record for selling the policy, surpassing UK life insurance salesman Peter Rosengard, who helped put together Geffen¡¯s policy.

Mr Frances is president of Santa Barbara-based SG LLC. The firm has represented the billionaire since he responded to a direct mail solicitation in 2010.

Mr Frances said the tycoon wants to remain anonymous for two reasons: privacy and keeping the news from his benefactors, adding: ¡°He wants his next of kin to keep working hard.¡±

He said the annual premium is in ¡°the low single digits of millions of dollars¡±. He said the insurance companies benefit from the deal by immediately investing the premium, and their risk is if the billionaire dies too soon. Mr Frances would not disclose the billionaire¡¯s age.

Several billionaires have connections to Mr Frances¡¯s firm, including Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Elon Musk, the founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors and other start-ups, declined to tell the San Jose Mercury News whether he was the policyholder.
