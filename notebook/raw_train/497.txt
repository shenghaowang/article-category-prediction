The American company Chiquita has struck a deal with the Irish Fyffes to create ChiquitaFyffes, the world¡¯s largest banana firm with an approximate worth of $1 billion.

¡°This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,¡± said Chiquita head Ed Lonergan, in BBC.

The newly formed company will be listed in New York, and shareholders will get shares in both firms, BBC reported. Fyffes¡® shareholders will own just at 49.3 percent of the merged firm, BBC said.

The deal was made with both cost cuts and expansions in mind, Mr. Lonergan said.
