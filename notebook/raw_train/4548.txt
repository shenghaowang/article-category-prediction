OTTAWA--Canada on Friday joined the U.S. in broadening its sanctions against Russia, adding the co-founder of major commodity-trading firm Gunvor Group as well as Bank Rossiya, which Ottawa described as the personal bank of senior Russian officials.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Ottawa is acting against those "responsible for undermining Ukraine's sovereignty." The 14 individuals named Friday included Gennady Timchenko, a founder of Gunvor Group, one of the world's largest commodity-trading companies.

Canada's move came a day after the U.S. included Mr. Timchenko in a new round of economic sanctions against Russia for its takeover of Ukraine's Crimea.

Others on Ottawa's latest list for "economic sanctions and travel bans" include an aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin, senior government officials, and Yuri Valentinovich Kovalchuk, the single largest shareholder of Bank Rossiya. Rossiya and Kovalchuk were also put on the U.S. sanctions list Thursday.

Ottawa also imposed economic sanctions against the bank itself "for its support of Russian officials who bear responsibility for the crisis."

Mr. Harper is currently traveling to Ukraine, where he is meeting officials before heading to the Netherlands and Germany.
