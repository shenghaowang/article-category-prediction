The Internet is abuzz with the news today that that Amazon will increase its annual fee for Amazon Prime by 25%, from $79 to $99. Starting April 17, customers will have to decide how much they're willing to pay for the unlimited two-day delivery service. Many are moaning about the price hike！and startup delivery services are jumping at this window of opportunity to grab disgruntled Amazon subscribers.

The folks at SF-based ShopRunner, for example, are offering free two-day deliveries for a year (it's typically $79 annually) to Amazon Prime members who haven't renewed their subscription. Shoprunner has set up a dedicated page on its site detailing the offer. And we're guessing same-day delivery services like Google Shopping Express, Walmart, and Six Doors are scheming their own ways to lure customers from their biggest competitor. Will you renew your Amazon Prime at the new price, or will you be shopping around come next month?
