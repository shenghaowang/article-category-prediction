3M Co. stock dropped nearly 6% in heavy Tuesday trade after the company reported third-quarter profit and revenue misses and issued downbeat 2018 guidance. Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $1.54 billion, or $2.58 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $2.33 per share in the year-earlier period. The FactSet adjusted earnings-per-share consensus was $2.70. Revenue declined to $8.15 billion from $8.17 billion in the year-earlier period, below the FactSet consensus of $8.41 billion. The latest results include flat sales in the company's industrial business, an increase in its safety and graphics division sales, and declines in its health care business (2.8% decline), electronics and energy business (down 4.8%) and consumer business (down 3.4%). 3M also revised its 2018 adjusted EPS expectations from a range of $10.20 to $10.45 to between $9.90 and $10 per share, below the FactSet consensus of $10.28 per share. The change reflects a full-year earnings headwind of 5 cents per share from foreign currency, while the prior expectation had been of a benefit of 10 cents per share, 3M said. Company shares have dropped nearly 5% over the last three months, compared with a 3.3% decline in the S&P 500 and a 0.2% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
