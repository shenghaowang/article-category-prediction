Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer took a swing on Friday, filing a lawsuit against the region's largest pay TV provider. The federal suit, filed on behalf of the city of Los Angeles, alleges that Time Warner Cable has "stiffed" the city out of nearly $10 million in fees -- during the financial crisis when the city was struggling to make ends meet, as the cable company was raking in billions of dollars from its customers.
