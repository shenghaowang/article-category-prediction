Relatives of passengers from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Xu Jinghong (L) and Dai Shuqin sit at a table at Xu's home in Beijing on December 30, 2014.

Chinese national Dai Shuqin, 61, who lost five family members on board MH370 - her sister Dai Shuling and brother-in-law Jiao Wenxue, both 58, their daughter Jiao Weiwei, 32, and son-in-law Wang Rui, 35, and the couple's son Wang Moheng, two.

My sister, my sister's husband, my niece, my niece's husband and their little son were returning home after a vacation in Malaysia.

Look at these photos we took together in 2013 ... see how chubby and adorable the baby was? I want to find my sister.

While some next of kin have chosen not to face the cameras, I want to speak to the media. I need to tell the world our pain, our anxiety.

My mother died several months before the tragedy, and I haven't been to her grave since last March 8. What am I going to say to her when my sister is still missing?

The last thing my younger brother said to me was: "Take care of yourself. Be more alert as your job is dangerous."

We were very close when we were growing up. I am now an odd job worker in (China's autonomous region) Xinjiang. He worked in Beijing and lived there with his wife and son, while our parents live in Gansu province.

I called him on March 4 after I fell from an electrical pole at work. I was all right, but I phoned him to tell him about the accident.

That was the last we spoke. He did not tell me his company was sending him to Malaysia on a working trip.

Our family is not rich and it was my brother who was the breadwinner in the family. He was our pride and pillar of strength. He took care of everything at home.

I don't always come to this family support centre in Shunyi (on the outskirts of Beijing).

The elders at home could not sleep and eat since the flight's disappearance.
