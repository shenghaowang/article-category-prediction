Twitter Is Going Beyond Advertising

As much as the digital advertising market is expanding, with global spending on digital ads on track to hit $227.1 billion in 2018 according to Zenith estimates, Twitter (TWTR) and many of its peers in the digital advertising business have sought to diversify beyond advertising. When Twitter reports its third-quarter results on October 25, there will likely be a lot of investor attention on how its diversification efforts are progressing. Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Snap (SNAP) are also making efforts to diversify their businesses beyond advertising, which currently accounts for the vast majority of their revenues.
