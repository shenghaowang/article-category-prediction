The Bank of England (BoE) could remain the lender-of-last-resort for Scottish banks should the country secede from the UK, but retain the pound outside a formal monetary union, governor Mark Carney has said.

The BoE has the discretion to lend to foreign entities, but it "doesn't have to", Carney told a parliamentary committee today, suggesting the issue would have to be resolved as the situation arose citing parallels to the European Union's ad-hoc response during the euro crisis.
