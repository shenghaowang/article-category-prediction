Join us for an interactive evening with Dr. Thomas Showalter, a medical oncologist with INTEGRIS Cancer Institute, and Dr. Kenneth Seres, gastroenterologist with Digestive Disease Specialists Inc., as they share the information on digestive health and discuss new developments in genetic screening for colon cancer. Participants will receive a free genetic screening questionnaire about Lynch syndrome, hear directly from a patient advocate about her experience with Lynch syndrome and the impact of genetic screening and enjoy a complimentary dinner.

The dinner will be at 6 p.m. March 26, at District 21 Restaurant, Francis Tuttle Technology Center, 12777 N. Rockwell Ave., Oklahoma City. For more information or to register, call the INTEGRIS HealthLine at 951-2277.
