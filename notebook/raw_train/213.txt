Gold climbed for a second session on Wednesday to its highest in 5-1/2 months, as global uncertainty over economic growth and tensions in Ukraine burnished the metal's safe-haven appeal.



Weakness in equities and base metals, along with technical buying, propelled gold prices through resistance at $1,355 an ounce, traders said.



Other precious metals were higher too, with silver climbing nearly 2 percent.



"There is quite a lot of attention on moves in other metal markets, like base metals," said one Hong Kong-based precious metals.



"It is possible we are seeing some move from base to precious metals. We are seeing some technically fuelled buying as well," he said.



"With temperatures rising in the market, people are sensing that gold's downside maybe more limited than some of the other markets."



Spot gold had gained 0.7 percent to $1,358.10 an ounce by 0710 GMT, after earlier hitting $1,362.24 - its highest since September 20. The metal gained 0.8 percent on Tuesday.



U.S. gold futures rose over 1 percent to their 5-1/2 month high of $1,364.10.



Bullion has gained 13 percent this year following a 28 percent drop in 2013, on escalating uncertainties around the world.
