7 CBO: Estimating the Budgetary Effects of the Affordable Care Act:

What the ACA means for you

The Affordable Care Act is perhaps the greatest overhaul of the US health-care system, and it will provide coverage for over 94% of Americans. In addition, one of its key reforms includes health coverage for adults with pre-existing conditions, which generally hadn¡¯t been available up until now.

These great changes in health-care insurance can benefit you and your loved ones, and this is why it¡¯s important for you to become familiar with the history of the Affordable Care Act.

To learn about the specific Obamacare-compliant health insurance plan options available to you¡ªplus see if you¡¯re eligible for a government subsidy to help pay for a plan¡ªget started on the eHealth site.

To understand the history of the Affordable Care Act, it¡¯s also helpful to review how a bill becomes a law in the United States government.

Congress is made up of two houses, the 435-member House of Representatives and the 100-member Senate. For a bill to become law, both houses typically need to vote on and pass the same bill. Once both houses pass a bill, the US president signs it, and the bill becomes law.

There are typically five steps for a bill to become law:
 Step 1: A simple majority ¨C 218 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives ¨C vote to pass their version of a bill.
 Step 2: A two-thirds majority ¨C 60 of 100 Senators ¨C vote to pass their version of a bill.
 Step 3: Both houses of Congress have a conference to create one revised version of the bill on which both houses agree.
 Step 4: A simple majority of both houses of Congress vote a second time to pass the revised version of the bill on which they both agree.
 Step 5: The president signs the bill into law.

Why the ACA was different

What makes the history of the Affordable Care Act different is that steps three and four (described above) did not take place in the traditional fashion.

Instead, the following happened prior to passing the Affordable Care Act:
 Budget reconciliation: The Senate used a process called budget reconciliation, to get their version of the bill, which was created by lawmakers, as a way to bring down the deficit by easing the path for budget and tax deals.
 Simple majority and no filibusters: With budget reconciliation, the Senate only needs 51 votes (instead of 60) to pass a piece of legislation. Debate on an issue in a bill is limited to 20 hours, and ¨C most importantly ¨C no Senate filibusters are allowed.

A filibuster is typically a process in the US Senate that allows one party to delay or entirely prevent a vote on a bill. Presently, the only way to end a filibuster is to get 60 Senators to vote to break a filibuster.
