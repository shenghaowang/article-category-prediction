Hertz announced today that its board of directors has approved plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.

The companies will be "Hertz," which will be comprised of the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly car rental business as well as Donlen, a provider of fleet leasing and management services; and "HERC," the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, according to a news release.

The separation is planned to be in the form of a tax-free spinoff to Hertz shareholders, the company said. The company has received a ruling from the IRS that allows it to separate the business in a tax-efficient manner.

Hertz expects the separation of HERC to close by early 2015. The company expects it will receive net cash proceeds of about $2.5 billion from the HERC spin-off, which it will use to pay down debt and support a newly approved $1 billion share repurchase program, according to a news release.

"Our rental car and equipment rental businesses are leaders in their respective markets with valuable assets and tremendous long-term potential," CEO Mark P. Frissora said in a prepared statement. "Through unbundling these undervalued assets, we unleash current and future shareholder value."

Frissora is expected to continue leading Hertz as chairman and CEO. HERC will determine and announce its board of directors and management positions as the separation plans are finalized.

Hertz announced last year that it is relocating its world headquarters from New Jersey to Estero. The company broke ground on its new headquarters in November.

Hertz is expected to discuss the separation and announce its fourth quarter and year-end results in a conference call at 10 a.m.
