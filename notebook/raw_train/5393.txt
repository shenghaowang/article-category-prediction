A redesigned bridge in Saudi Arabia could help 3 million Muslims complete their holy pilgrimage. 



Every year, millions of Muslims flock to Mecca during the 5 days of the Hajj. But because of overcrowding, some Muslims die each year. As many as 300,000 will cross the Jamarat Bridge every hour. 



Recent upgrades, including 308 escalators, six elevators, and two helipads, will help accommodate the massive crowds, which should help relieve the dangerous crowding that has claimed many lives.
