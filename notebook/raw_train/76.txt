Stock indexes in the greater China region fell significantly on Tuesday, tracking steep losses seen overnight on Wall Street.

Meanwhile, the Shanghai composite closed 3.4 percent lower at 3,369.71, posting its steepest loss in two years. The blue-chip CSI300 Index closed 2.9 percent lower at 4,148.33.

Markets were already under pressure this week following the pullback in the U.S. market.

Risk aversion was high, with bond and gold prices gaining amid the equities sell-off.

"There's really nowhere to hide. If you review the market, across the board, there is very heavy selling pressure," said Hao Hong, chief strategist at China's Bank of Communications.

Hong recommended watching for dangers rather than potential gains in the near-term, although bonds ¡ª particularly government bonds ¡ª and gold appeared to be safe havens.
