Alibaba's latest deal shows the extent of investors' frenzy for China's Internet. The e-commerce giant announced Tuesday it had agreed to buy 60 percent of Hong-Kong listed ChinaVision for $804 million. The film group's market value promptly soared to almost $5 billion. Star-struck investors are too easily excited.



Investors may be betting on Alibaba moving into digital entertainment - it launched a set-top box and TV operating system last year. ChinaVision's movies and film rights could help give it a toehold in online video and entertainment. But even if Alibaba is successful, it's not clear that would transform the Hong Kong unit's prospects.



Another possibility is that Alibaba wants to use ChinaVision as a backdoor route to a stock market listing. Jack Ma Yun's company is locked in an impasse with Hong Kong stock market regulators over its corporate governance structure. In the unlikely event that Alibaba tried, it's hard to imagine the authorities would allow a company with a likely valuation of more than $100 billion to sneak onto the market.
