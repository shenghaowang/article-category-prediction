Neil Woodford, one of the country's most prominent fund managers, has axed bonuses at his firm for all staff in a bid to discourage "short-term" decision-making.

All 35 staff at Woodford Investment Management, from fund managers to IT staff and sales people, have been put on a flat salary as of April 1, the Times reported.
