TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) -- Florida's unemployment rate is on the decline.

New numbers released today show that the state's unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since june 2008. There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.

Governor Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies. But state economists say it's due to people leaving the labor force or those who have delayed their job search. Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.
