Airbnb¡¯s projected $10 billion valuation represents a stunning rise for the online home rental company, which started modestly in San Francisco in 2007 and had several stumbles before finding its footing.

A promotional foray involving ¡°Obama O¡¯s¡± breakfast cereal during the Democratic National Convention in 2008, as well as a big public push at the South by Southwest conference that same year, both failed to boost the company¡¯s business.

But Airbnb¡¯s venture capital investors saw something potentially huge, even in the company¡¯s earliest days. They thought the market opportunity was big and they were impressed by the founding team.

Luck also played a big part. If it wasn¡¯t for Barry Manilow¡¯s drummer, the company may never have gotten on the right track.
