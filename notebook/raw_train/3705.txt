I never really understood the MLM model, so the distinction between an MLM and a pyramid scheme is one that is too subtle for my understanding. In a true pyramid scheme it's just moving money around. In MLM there are actual products being sold. Of course the products are incidental. MLM promises that you can recruit a team to be under you and sell and you will get a cut of everything they sell and anything the people they recruit sell.

 

 Thing is the products are either the same stuff you can get at a store for the same price or specialty goods that people don't buy that often. Also the "sales people" have to buy all of their demo products with their own money . That and charging for classes to teach you to be a better sales person is how the company makes money.
