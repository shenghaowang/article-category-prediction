All three of Ohio's largest banks passed the latest round of stress tests mandated by regulators, meaning they would be expected to survive if the economy collapsed like it did six years ago.

Only one of the 30 banks most significant to the U.S. financial system, Zions Bank of Salt Lake City, didn't pass the stress test imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Locally, KeyCorp of Cleveland, Fifth Third of Cincinnati and Huntington of Columbus all passed, as did three other banks with a significant presence in Northeast Ohio: PNC, Chase and U.S. Bank.

The tests have been assessed four times since 2009 on the 18 most significant banks. This year, however, 12 banks with more than $50 billion in assets were added. That added banks like Huntington.

The tests look at how the bank would fare if it were pounded by loan losses and were hemorrhaging capital.

Specifically, regulators looked at the health of the banks if the economy was hit by a deep recession with high unemployment, a tanking stock market and a drop in home values to 2001 levels.

In addition, the tests this year looked at what would happen if a bank's largest counterparty defaulted.

One part of the stress test looked at potential loan loss rates among the banks. Key, Fifth Third and Huntington all were below the average of 5.6 percent.



In this post-meltdown era, banks must get approval for things they spend capital on, such as dividends paid to shareholders and purchases of other banks. The Federal Reserve next week will release results on whether the banks' requests for their capital have been approved.
