Speaking to KMGH, Luke Barrington of DigitalGlobe said: "This is a real needle-in-the-haystack problem, except the haystack is in the middle of the ocean."

"I will ask you to mark anything that looks interesting, any signs of wreckage or life rafts."

DigitalGlobe's images have been taken from 400 miles above the Gulf of Thailand but are so advanced they can capture the smallest of details in the ocean, CNN reported.

The technique of asking members of the pubilic to gather information like this is known as "crowdsourcing".

The firm's website crashed today because so many people from around the world attempted to help out .

Mr Barrington added: "In many cases the areas covered are so large, or the things we're looking for are so hard to find, that without the help of hundreds of thousands of people online, we'd never be able to find them."

The search for the missing flight is now in its fourth day with the search parameters being expanded further.

The flight is presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast after losing contact with air traffic controllers.
