LONDON ¨C Britain¡¯s finance ministry is set to name a new Bank of England deputy governor for monetary policy to replace Charlie Bean on Tuesday, a source familiar with the appointments process said.

BoE Governor Mark Carney is due to give a speech at 1805 GMT on Tuesday announcing wide-ranging changes to the Bank¡¯s organisation, including details of a separate new post of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.

¡°The Treasury is likely to announce the new deputy governor for monetary policy before Mr Carney¡¯s speech,¡± the source said.

Britain¡¯s finance ministry has advertised for a successor to Bean, who retires on June 30.

The BoE¡¯s chief economist, Spencer Dale, is the favourite to succeed Bean, according to bookmakers Paddy Power, although other recent senior appointments ¨C including that of Carney himself ¨C have not gone to BoE insiders.

Carney is also keen to have more women in senior positions at the BoE. None currently serve on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates.

The Bank of England declined to comment on when the appointment would be announced.
