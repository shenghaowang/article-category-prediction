Your training is a central part of your overall experience. No two clients learn the same way, or have the same needs, which is why all of our classes are tailor-made to suit your individual objectives. Our trainers understand that every client is different, and their teaching style is flexible to adapt to the students in each group.

At The London School of English, every group is different. We don¡¯t use standard textbooks, which allows us to create course content each week built around your goals, and those of your classmates. Every part of the course is developed with you in mind. It is the closest you can get to individual training within the context of a group course.

Our trainers are carefully selected for their experience, their enthusiasm and their specialised knowledge. Our trainers have been teaching English for a number of years and have a huge wealth of experience. All of our contracted trainers hold a Diploma in English Language Teaching for Adults (DELTA) qualification and many of them have prior experience in a number of industries, which enables them to offer valuable subject knowledge on our specialised professional courses.

We believe it is essential to be able to track your progress throughout your course. If you are studying for a long period of time, continued tracking helps us to ensure that you are making progress at the right rate in order to hit your goal. Our long-stay student consultant will meet with you on a regular basis to assess your development and discuss the remainder of your course. If you are studying for a short period, tracking your progress allows you to demonstrate the value of your course. Our end of course report breaks your language level down into 15 categories, offering you a clear and concise analysis of your strengths and weaknesses as well looking at how your confidence in English has developed.
