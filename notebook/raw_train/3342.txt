Coffee chain behemoth Starbucks has revamped its iPhone app to let customers tip baristas digitally and pay with a shake of their handsets.

The app upgrade will see visitors to around 7000 of Starbucks' 11,000 US stores given the option to tip either $0.50, $1.00 or $2.00 when they pay with their phone. Tipping will be added to the Android app later this year. 



Another new feature aims to make the mobile payment process easier by letting users shake their phone to bring the barcode of their Starbucks card front and centre of the app, saving them the hassle of swiping through pages of menus.



Starbucks has pioneered m-payments and now claims 10 million customers for its app, with 11% of transactions going through mobile devices. As well as its own hugely popular offering, the firm has a partnership with, and has invested in, Square.



Adam Brotman, chief digital officer, Starbucks, says: "This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we'll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come."
