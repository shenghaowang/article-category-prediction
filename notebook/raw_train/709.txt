SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Alibaba's eye-popping IPO plans in the U.S. just sent ripples from Hong Kong to New York to Sunnyvale, Calif.

The decision by the Chinese e-commerce leviathan -- whose online properties handle more goods than eBay and Amazon.com combined -- to hold its long-awaited public offering in the USA is a blow to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which was initially the company's preferred venue.

But it is a boon to two of Alibaba's largest shareholders: Yahoo, which owns 24%, and Japan's Softbank, which controls 37%.

Alibaba's success has essentially propped up the Silicon Valley Internet giant's shares hugely, even as its core business has languished. Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimated in a recent research note that Alibaba alone is worth $21 of Yahoo's stock price, which closed at $37.60 on Friday.

Alibaba Group doesn't report its finances. But Yahoo, which initially invested in it in 2005, said Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ending in September rose 51% from a year earlier to $1.8 billion.

While the Hong Kong market mourns its lost golden goose, U.S. investors have billions of dollar signs dancing in their heads and calculators.

Alibaba, which controls about 80% of China's e-commerce, is sure to add sizzle to the New York financial scene: Its public offering could be one of the biggest ever in the U.S. Some estimates peg its valuation at $130 billion.
