PARIS--Bouygues SA (EN.FR) has raised its bid for Vivendi SA's (VIV.FR) telecom unit SFR, a spokesman for the company said Thursday, confirming several earlier press reports.

"Bouygues submitted its reviewed offer to Vivendi Wednesday," the spokesman said. He declined to provide any detail of the improved offer but said the group will communicate financial details to the market before it opens.

Reuters late Wednesday said an improved bid could take the cash portion of Bouygues' offer up to as much as 11.4 billion euros ($15.8 billion) from 10.5 billion last week, citing two people familiar with the matter.

Vivendi's board is due to meet Friday to review bids it has received for its telecoms unit, people familiar with the matter have said.
