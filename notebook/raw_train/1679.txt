Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would return nearly twice the amount of money they received from the U.S. Treasury if the current bailout arrangement isn¡¯t changed over the next decade, according to the White House budget office.

By the end of March, the two mortgage-finance companies that were seized by the U.S. in 2008 will have returned $202.9 billion in dividend payments, after receiving $187.5 billion in federal support between 2008 and 2011. The budget projections released Monday by the White House Office of Management and Budget show that the companies could return an additional $163.8 billion through the 2024 fiscal year if the bailout arrangement remains in place.
