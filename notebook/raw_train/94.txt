The main attractions of Master of None co-creator Alan Yang¡¯s newest project, Forever, are its stars, Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen. That¡¯s all that we really know ¡ª the show is being strangely coy about its premise. For now, all we have is this summary: ¡°Married couple June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) live a comfortable but predictable life in suburban Riverside, California. For 12 years they¡¯ve had the same conversations, eaten the same meals and taken pleasant vacations at the same rented lake house. But after June talks Oscar into shaking things up with a ski trip, the pair suddenly find themselves in completely unfamiliar territory.¡± What does that mean? Who knows, really ¡ª but it could be really good. Arrives September 14.

A two-part BBC2 adaptation of the classic play, King Lear stars Anthony Hopkins as the titular monarch and moves the setting to the present day for a grim take on an exceptionally dark tragedy, and the king¡¯s gradual descent into madness is made even more unsettling in the gray light of the 21st century. Arrives September 28.
