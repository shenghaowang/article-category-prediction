TRIPOLI, Libya, March 11 (UPI) -- A spokesman for Libya's General National Congress said a North Korean-flagged oil tanker was intercepted by military forces and escorted to the Misurata port.

Libya's National Oil Corp. said Monday the tanker Morning Glory had taken on a load of crude oil illegally from Sidra, a port under rebel control in eastern Libya. Omar Hemidan, a spokesman for the General National Congress, confirmed to the Libya Herald the tanker was intercepted and was on its way to the port at Misurata.

Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan threatened to use force against the North Korean-flagged ship. The Libyan company said it would pursue "all of its remedies" to protect its interests "and to hold responsible all the parties participating in illicit transactions relating to it in any jurisdiction, both within and outside of Libya."

Libya's oil production has suffered as a result of ongoing security issues and internal rivalries. Libyan militia leader Ibrahim Jadran seized the eastern port of Sidra in July.

Last week, Italian energy company Eni said Libya was an important natural gas partner for the region, though BP said it was exploring other options for exploration drilling onshore in Libya because of security concerns.
