In a note released Monday, Imperial Capital voiced concerns that J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) may need to ¡°issue additional equity to pay down debt or eventually restructure.¡± Analyst Mary Ross-Gilbert maintains an Underperform rating and $2.50 price target on the shares, but also maintained a Buy rating on J.C. Penney bonds maturing 2020-2097.

Ross-Gilbert recommends that investors ¡°hedge a long [bond ] position by shorting the shares and/or the shorter-dated bonds.¡± Longer-dated bonds ¡°create the company at 33% of revenues (43% excluding excess cash), which compares favorably to other major departments store retailers trading in the 43%-92% range,¡± says the analyst.

The Imperial analyst believes ¡°debt leverage would be nearly 10x, potentially requiring a restructuring unless JCP raises additional equity.¡± Ross-Gilbert views this as a possibility based on ¡°anticipated positive operating momentum.¡±
