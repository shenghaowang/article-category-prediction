Malaysian authorities have released the transcript of the final words exchanged between the control tower in Kuala Lumpur and the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.

In a statement, authorities maintained the last words received by ground controllers were "good night Malaysian three seven zero" and not "all right, good night" as previously stated.

Malaysia's transport ministry said that the transcript was initially withheld "as part of the police investigation".

"Previously, Malaysia Airlines had stated initial investigation indicated that the voice which signed off was that of the co-pilot," the statement read.

"The police are working to confirm this belief, and forensic examination of the actual recording is ongoing.

"The international investigations team and the Malaysian authorities remain of the opinion that, up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, MH370's movements were consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane."
