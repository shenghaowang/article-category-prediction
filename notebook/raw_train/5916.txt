FRESNO, Calif. - A congressional committee is taking up California's drought crisis in Fresno at the heart of the state's agricultural region.



The House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday will hear testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state water officials - all grappling with the drought.



The hearing at Fresno's City Hall is titled "California Water Crisis and its Impacts: The Need for Immediate and Long-Term Solutions."



California is in its third consecutive dry year. Gov. Jerry Brown in January declared a drought emergency, and in February President Barack Obama visited to see the crisis firsthand, delivering millions in relief aid.

Democratic Rep. Jim Costa, who serves on the committee, says he hopes the hearing in his hometown will bring solutions rather than enflame partisan politics over water.
