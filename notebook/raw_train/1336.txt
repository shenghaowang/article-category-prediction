All eyes are on General Motors. The Detroit-based automaker¡¯s recall of 1.6 million vehicles last month has prompted federal prosecutors to investigate whether GM broke the law by failing to disclose vehicle flaws¡ªsuch as the Chevrolet Cobalt¡¯s defective ignition switches, which have been linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths¡ªin a timely matter. Additionally, a Senate panel overseeing consumer-product safety plans to hold hearings for GM in the coming weeks, and a separate House committee plans to conduct its own investigation into the company¡¯s widespread vehicle recalls. GM isn¡¯t the first car company to come under federal scrutiny. The Justice Department is discussing a settlement to a four-year investigation into Toyota¡¯s multimillion-vehicle recalls in 2009 and 2010.
