China made one of its strongest moves yet to show that it believes the yuan is ready to become a global currency by loosening daily trading limits.

The move to widen the currency's trading range, which went into effect on Monday, doesn't eliminate Beijing's tight grip on the yuan. China's central bank still sets a daily reference rate for its currency. On Monday in China, the yuan opened modestly weaker in currency trading, after the central bank set a reference rate for the yuan stronger than Friday's market close.
