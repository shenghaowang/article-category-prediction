Shares of Herbalife started the week up more than 2 percent after it was recently reported by The Wall Street Journal that government investigations cleared the company of allegations of having a fraudulent business model.

Probes by the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office failed to find sufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing within Herbalife, a multilevel marketing company that focuses on nutritional supplements, sources told the newspaper, which first reported it late Friday.

The investigations similarly cleared activist investor Bill Ackman, who has a $1 billion short position against Herbalife, the Journal said. The inquiry focused on allegations that Ackman's closed-end fund, Pershing Square Holdings, might have manipulated Herbalife's stock price.
