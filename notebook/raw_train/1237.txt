The most camera-ready opponent of Comcast¡¯s merger plans with Time Warner Cable ¡ª who, ironically, owes his big break to Comcast-owned NBC ¡ª went on CBS This Morning to again blast the proposed merger, saying ¡°consumers will end up paying more, there will be less competition, there will be less innovation and, worse, even worse service.¡± Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) this morning said he sent out an email to his constituents to get their ¡°feelings about what kind of service they get from Comcast¡± and whether they think the proposed deal ¡°will be good.¡± ¡°I got 60,000 responses, and believe me, people don¡¯t like their service from Comcast, and they don¡¯t think this deal is going to help them,¡± said Franken ¡ª who, before entering politics in a big way was a writer and performer on the now Comcast-owned NBC¡¯s Saturday Night Live from its launch in the mid 1970s until 1980, returning in 1985 for another decade. Watch his appearance here:

Franken matters because he sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee which, later this month, will hold hearings on the reported $45 billion deal that would give Comcast 30 million subscribers in 43 of the nation¡¯s top 50 markets ¡ª aka about 30% of pay TV customers. Franken reminded CBS This Morning anchors this morning he hadn¡¯t been any too happy about the Comcast/NBCU merger either.

Franken laughed when CBS News¡¯ Senior Business and Economics Correspondent Anthony Mason brought up Comcast¡¯s argument that it and Time Warner Cable don¡¯t overlap in markets, explaining, ¡°I¡¯m laughing because we¡¯re supposed to take great comfort from the fact that this is the No. 1 cable company and the No. 2 and they don¡¯t compete in any market, so they¡¯re saying you should be happy that we have these monopolies and now we¡¯re going to be one company with twice as much of a monopoly.¡±
