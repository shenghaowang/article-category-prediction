The company behind the compulsively addictive cellphone game Candy Crush Saga is expected to be worth up to $7.6 billion when it starts publicly trading later this month. Turns out that getting people to spend their subway rides moving three same-colored candies into a row is a very lucrative industry.

Talks of an IPO were first heard last June, but as Aman Shah and Neha Dimri report for Reuters, King Digital Entertainment Plc are looking to capitalize on a strong demand for technology investments. Facebook's recent $16 billion purchase of mobile messaging app WhatsApp and Twitter¡¯s successful IPO in November have boosted confidence ¡ª but just don't mention Zynga.

Shah and Dimri also report that the King IPO could prompt other technology companies, many of whom are known for their ¡°disruptive¡± ethos, including Spotify, AirBnB, and Square, the payments company, to go public sooner rather than later.

King Digital, who announced they were going public in February, has 180 games in 14 languages for Facebook, mobile platforms and their website. But its main draw is Candy Crush, which was the most downloaded free app of 2013 and has been downloaded more than 500 million times since it launched in 2012.
