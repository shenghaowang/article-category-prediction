TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Florida's latest unemployment numbers are coming out and could signal whether the state's economic recovery is continuing.

 

The state's unemployment numbers for January will be released on Monday. The rate in the month of December was 6.2 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.

 

Payroll provider ADP reported that the state added 11,610 private sector jobs in January and 10,840 additional jobs during the month of February. ADP's survey is separate from the one that is conducted by government agencies.

 

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

 

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.
