LONDON: Gold recovered from early losses to edge higher on Monday as support from the standoff in Ukraine offset pressure from last week's strong US payrolls data and weakness in other commodities after a sharp drop in Chinese exports.

Spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at $1,342.60 an ounce at 1214 GMT, while US gold futures for April delivery were up $4.70 an ounce to $1,342.90.

The precious metal fell as low as $1,328.86 in earlier trade, extending a 0.8pc drop it made on Friday after US payrolls data beat forecasts, suggesting the Federal Reserve's stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.

Among other precious metals, silver was flat at$20.88 an ounce. The gold/silver ratio hit a fresh five-week high at 64.4 as silver underperformed on Monday.

Spot platinum was down 0.2pc at $1,475 an ounce, while spot palladium was down 0.9pc at$772.40 an ounce.¡ªReuters
