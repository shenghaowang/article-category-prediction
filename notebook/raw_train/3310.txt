U.S. Navy Seals have reportedly seized control of a rogue oil tanker that was fueled and controlled for more than a week by Libyan rebels.

¡°The boarding operation, approved by President Obama and conducted just after 10 p.m. EDT on March 16 in international waters southeast of Cyprus, was executed by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs attached to Special Operations Command Europe,¡± said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby in a press release published on Monday.

Earlier this month, rebel forces in eastern Libya had managed to load the 37,000-ton tanker Morning Glory with crude oil owned by the state-run National Oil Company and elude the country¡¯s naval forces.

Following the weekend¡¯s operation, the U.S. Department of Defense reported that the tanker was headed back to Libya where it would be returned to the authorities.

¡° will be underway soon to a port in Libya with a team of sailors from the USS Stout (DDG-55) embarked. The sailors will be supervising the transit,¡± said Kirby.

The tanker crisis is that latest such incident to underscore the fragile hold the country¡¯s interim central government has over the restive country and the myriad militas that have operated freely in the three years since the execution of former strongman Muammar Gaddafi.
