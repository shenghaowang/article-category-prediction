The widening of the yuan trading band by the People's Bank of China is an important milestone on the path to further reforms but it also means that the Chinese currency is less of a sure bet for speculative investors.

The reform, announced on Saturday, means that the limits within which the yuan is allowed to trade against the US dollar have been doubled to as much as 2 per cent above or below the daily fix as of Monday.

In reality however, the yuan has been a largely one-way bet attracting enormous capital from investors. It has appreciated almost uninterrupted against the greenback for at least the past seven years until the PBOC intervened in foreign exchange markets last month to intentionally devalue the currency. That exercise was designed to introduce some volatility into the market as a precursor to the widening of the trading band and served as a warning to speculators.

National Australia Bank's global co-head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attrill, said that investors trading offshore yuan for the currency appreciation and also higher yield on offer could no longer count on it being as concrete a bet. "It's going to be a more treacherous playground for people playing the carry trade," he said. "They can be much less confident those gains are assured."

Even so, NAB still takes a bullish view on the yuan in the medium-term.
