Oracle acquires DataFox, a developer of 'predictive intelligence as a service' across millions of company records

Oracle today announced that it has made another acquisition, this time to enhance both the kind of data that it can provide to its business customers, and its artificial intelligence capabilities: it is buying DataFox, a startup that has amassed a huge company database -- currently covering 2.8 million public and private businesses, adding 1.2 million each year -- and uses AI to analyse that to make larger business predictions. The business intelligence resulting from that service can in turn be used for a range of CRM-related services: prioritising sales accounts, finding leads, and so on. "The combination of Oracle and DataFox will enhance Oracle Cloud Applications with an extensive set of AI-derived company-level data and signals, enabling customers to reach even better decisions and business outcomes," noted Steve Miranda, EVP of applications development at Oracle, in a note to DataFox customers announcing the deal.
