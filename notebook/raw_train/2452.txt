
 Fears plane will never be found

As dozens of ships and aircraft from 10 nations scour the seas for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, a US-based satellite imaging company has launched its own search effort with a crowdsourcing campaign to locate the Boeing 777.

DigitalGlobe, which operates commercial imaging satellites, has made available high-resolution images from the weekend of the area where evidence suggests plane with 239 people on board may have crashed into the water.

It is asking volunteers to log onto its Tomnod website and comb through images in the hope of locating something of interest.

So far, 3,200 square kilometres of imagery has been made available for volunteers to search online. More images will be released over the next 24 hours.
