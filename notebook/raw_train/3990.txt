US employers have advertised slightly more jobs, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.

The Labor Department says employers in January posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 per cent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped four million since March 2008.

The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.

Total hiring slipped 0.9 per cent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly five million people are hired each month.
