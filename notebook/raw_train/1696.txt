This is the moment the pilots of the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight walked through security for the

final time before take-off. 



CCTV footage captures Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, pilot of the Boeing 777 flight, being frisked while walking through security at Kuala Lumpar International Airport. 



He is then joined by co-pilot Fariq Hamid who is also searched before the pair walk onto the plane.



Officials revealed today that it is possible the aircraft could have landed and transmitted a satellite signal from the ground.
