HONG KONG ¡ª Asian markets moved lower on Thursday, with Japan and Hong Kong leading the region down, as an important measure of Chinese manufacturing activity dropped to a seven-month low.

Hong Kong¡¯s Hang Seng Index HSI, -3.08% finished 1.2% lower at 22394.08 after the initial February reading on HSBC¡¯s preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index slid to 48.3 from a final score of 49.5 in January. A score below 50 points to a contraction in factory activity, while a reading above 50 indicates an expansion.

The impact of the data was felt in Australia ¡ª a country with strong trade ties to China ¡ª where the Australian dollar fell to US$0.8964 compared with US$0.9002 late Wednesday in New York.

The yen also strengthened after the Chinese data came out, a sign of increased risk aversion, with the dollar USDJPY, -0.54% falling below 102 yen. The greenback was last at 101.70, compared with 102.31 late Wednesday in New York.

A firmer local currency resulted in Japanese stocks extending their losses from earlier in the session, with the Nikkei NIK, -2.67% losing 2.2% for the day to 14449.18. Before the data came out, the market was already lower as it continued to come down from Tuesday¡¯s sharp 3.1% rise ¡ª the market¡¯s best daily gain since August, which was brought about by the Bank of Japan¡¯s surprise move to double incentives to spur bank lending.

Elsewhere in Asia, Australia¡¯s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -1.05% was up 0.1% to 5412.30, nearly paring all of its previous gains after the factory data was released, while South Korea¡¯s Kospi SEU, -2.57% was down 0.6% to 1930.57 and Singapore¡¯s Straits Times Index STI, -1.52% was 0.1% lower late in Asia.

The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -2.26% fell only 0.2% to 2138.78, as the market was supported by oil companies. The sector was in focus due to news that China¡¯s largest oil refiner, Sinopec 600688, -1.04% , 0338, -3.95% plans to open up its domestic marketing and distribution operations to outside investors. Shares in Sinopec were up 10%, after hitting the daily upper trading limit, while shares in PetroChina Co. 601857, -2.07% PTR, -3.57% added 4.7%.

Also weighing on regional sentiment was Wednesday¡¯s negative session on Wall Street, where stocks fell after U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed that some Fed officials argued for raising interest rates sooner than expected. A warning from the International Monetary Fund about the current problems in emerging markets also weighed on sentiment.

In corporate news, the Australian earnings season continued. Shares in Leighton Holdings AU:LEI shot 4.9% higher, after Australia¡¯s largest contractor reported that its annual net profit had risen by 13%, as it replaced contracts in the weakening mining sector with projects in areas such as hospitals and hotel resorts.

Also in Sydney, shares in AMP AMP, +2.50% jumped 9.3% higher, as the company¡¯s full-year underlying profit was above expectations. However, the life insurer and pension manager reported a 2.5% fall in its annual profit as a rise in income-protection claims and a drop income on shareholder funds offset growth in other areas.
