Sbarro¡¯s, the pizza chain for hungry travelers and mall shoppers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, its second time in less than three years.

Sbarro¡¯s and its affiliates have between $100 million and $500 million in debt, according to court filings. The company previously filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was working its way out of debt.

In February, the New York-based pizza chain said it was closing more than 150 stores nationwide in a bid to improve its finances. The company faces a problem plaguing many retailers: dwindling mall traffic. Many of its stores are located in shopping-center food courts.

The number of people shopping at malls has dropped during the past decade as Americans increasingly shop online. Earlier this year, RadioShack, Staples, J.C. Penney and Macy¡¯s announced that they were closing locations around the country.

Sbarro¡¯s, including franchises, has more than 1,000 locations in 45 countries. The chain opened its first location in Brooklyn in 1956.
