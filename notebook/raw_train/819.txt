DETROIT (WKZO) -- A new report finds the cost of a replacement part for faulty ignition switches in 1.6-million General Motors vehicles may be as little as two-dollars per part. Auto analysts at JP Morgan released their findings related to the recall this week. GM supplier Delphi Corporation may incur some of the costs for the new part. Officials say 13 deaths and 31 accidents were caused by the failure of the ignition switch.
