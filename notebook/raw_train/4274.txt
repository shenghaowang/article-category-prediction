"Multiple snowstorms and the polar vortex during the December and January periods resulted in a sharp decline in traffic and, therefore, we were unable to achieve our comparable store sales goals in the fourth quarter," said Brendan Hoffman, the Bon-Ton's president and chief executive officer in a prepared statement.

The harsh winter contributed to a 7 percent drop in fourth-quarter sales at The Bon-Ton Stores, company officials announced Tuesday.

Despite the loss, the company's gross margin rate was slightly better than in the previous year, Hoffman said. And the company's inventory level was 5 percent below the previous year's.

The company also announced that Hoffman will step down due to personal reasons after his contract expires next year.

"I am extremely proud of the Bon-Ton team and what we have accomplished since I joined in 2012," Hoffman said in a prepared statement. "I truly enjoyed working for the company these past two years."

The company's board of directors will undertake a national search to find a new chief executive officer.

The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., with corporate headquarters in York and Milwaukee operates 270 department stores, which includes 10 furniture galleries, in 25 states in the Northeast and Midwest under the Bon-Ton, Bergner's, Boston Store, Carson's, Elder-Beerman, Herberger's and Younkers nameplates.

There are seven Bon-Ton stores in the Lehigh Valley area, including at the South Mall in Allentown and the Palmer Park Mall.
