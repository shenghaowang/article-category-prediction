Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick maintained a Neutral rating and $150 price target on Red Hat (RHT) after the company's "disappointing" Q1 results and lowered FY19 guidance. Unlike recent disappointments in Oracle (ORCL), Adobe (ADBE) and Workday (WKDAY), Zelnick said he believes this event may be too difficult to dismiss as a "harbinger of deceleration in enterprise IT spend." Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow, while acknowledging current investor skepticism for the name, says Oracle's current valuation remains attractive given its underlying fundamentals. The analyst believes, however, that Oracle "will remain in the penalty box in the near to mid-term" as investors digest the reporting structure changes and wait for additional metrics in lieu of the condensed financial reporting. Nonetheless, Lenschow continues to see upside in the shares and reiterates an Overweight rating with a $58 price target. Jefferies analyst John DiFucci kept his Buy rating and $61 price target on Oracle but lowered his FY19 EPS target to $3.34 from $3.42. The analyst notes that he is updating his model based on the new ASC 606 accounting standard, and the changes in his valuation model are driven by modestly reduced license revenue due to the requirement to recognize declining term license upfront. DiFucci contends that this requirement translates negatively to the bottom line.
