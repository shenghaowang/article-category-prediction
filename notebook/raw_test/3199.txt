Attention Walmart shoppers: you may now trade-in games at the media department at select store across the United States.

The trade-in incentive launches March 26, and will roll-out at 3,100 Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club stores across America in conjunction with CE Exchange.

Later this year, pre-owned games will be placed on shelves, so the games you trade-in for store credit next week won¡¯t be available for re-sell immediately.

The retailer has posted a video tutorial showing you how to go about trading your unwanted games in, and we¡¯ve posted it below.

Pre-owned games are already available through the firm¡¯s website.
