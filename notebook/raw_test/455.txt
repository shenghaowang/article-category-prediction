It has been revealed Chinese satellite images which were believed to show debris from the missing Malaysian plane were released by mistake.

Officials in Malaysia say their Chinese embassy has confirmed the pictures of objects in the sea near Vietnam were not of flight 370.

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said they were not told this until after teams had been out searching.

Minister Hussein alsodenied a report that engine data from the plane indicated it may have kept flying for four hours.

The report claimed the Rolls-Royce engines sent data to the engine manufacturer as part of a maintenance programme.

But Mr Hishammuddin insisted both Rolls-Royce and Boeing said the report was wrong.
