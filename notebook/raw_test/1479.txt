Officials familiar with the situation say that the ongoing tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the US are likely over for the time being, at least on the Russian side, as President Putin is rejecting calls for more retaliation.

Russia¡¯s Foreign Ministry urged the US not to make any more hostile actions either, warning that imposing yet more sanctions would not serve America¡¯s interest and was an irresponsible threat to bilateral ties.

As a practical matter, the sanctions on both sides have had little to no real impact, and even the US sanctions against ¡°wealthy Russians¡± were blunted by apparent anticipation on that side, with billionaire Gennady Timchenko selling all his shares in a US firm the day before the sanctions came out.

Russia¡¯s central bank has similarly promised to back the sanctioned Rossiya Bank, which President Putin suggested he wants to open an account at now that it is a target. If anything, the sanctions might serve as a publicity coup for the company.

On both sides that¡¯s been the story so far, with US hawks bonding over inclusion on a Russian travel ban list, and Russian officials similarly united by being part of the ¡°targeted¡± faction.

The one practical harm the sanctions have done is Visa and MasterCard cutting ties with Russia¡¯s SMP bank, which is odd because the bank wasn¡¯t actually sanctioned. Rather, the companies appear to have acted unilaterally because some of the sanctioned ¡°wealthy Russians¡± owned stock in the bank.
