WASHINGTON (AP) ¡ª Unemployment rates rose in 43 states last month, the government said Friday, painting a bleak picture of the job market and illustrating nationwide data released two weeks ago.

The rise in joblessness was a sharp change from November, when 36 states said their unemployment rates fell. Four states ¡ª Delaware, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina ¡ª reported record-high jobless rates in December.

New Jersey¡¯s rate, meanwhile, rose to a 33-year high of 10.1 percent while New York¡¯s reached a 26-year high of 9 percent.

Analysts said the report showed the economy is recovering at too weak a pace to generate consistent job creation. A lot of states that had started to add jobs in November gave up the gains in December, Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director at Moody¡¯s Economy.com, said.

Texas and Georgia lost more jobs in December than they had gained the previous month, Ms. Koropeckyj noted, while Arizona and South Carolina lost nearly as many as they had gained.
