Harper also issued an economic sanction against Bank Rossiya, a financial institution that serves as the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation following the ¡°so-called¡± referendum that annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

¡°Together with our international allies, our government is taking a strong stance in our support for Ukraine. We continue to take additional actions to limit the capabilities of specific individuals and Bank Rossiya, which are responsible for undermining Ukraine¡¯s sovereignty,¡± he said in a statement.

The Russian officials include Andrei Alexandrovich Fursenko, aide to President of the Russian Federation, Victor Petrovich Ivanov, member of the security council of the Russian Federation, as well as various military and foreign policy advisors.

Harper left for a trip to Ukraine Friday morning to meet with that country¡¯s prime minister and show support for Ukrainians during the Russian incursion into the Crimean peninsula.

The brief trip to Ukraine comes a few days before Harper is expected to make the case for a tough, united G7 front against the Russians.
