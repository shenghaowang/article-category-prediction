Boeing's (BA) 787 Dreamliner is safe, according to authorities Wednesday, despite several incidents related to the plane's battery that resulted in its grounding last year.

Without mentioning the battery or any prior issues, the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing said the plane meets the "intended high level of safety," following a joint review that was initiated in January 2013.

Boeing shares were flat on the stock market today.

The review gave Boeing several recommendations on its processes, such as improving the flow of information, improving standards and expectations from the company and its suppliers, and implementing a process to follow when a new model aircraft is being developed.

Boeing said it has already made some of the improvements and will continue implementing the recommendations. It restructured its commercial airplane development under one organization last year.

The review came after two fires on 787s last January that led to the grounding of the aircraft for several months. No cause for the fires was found, but Boeing issued a fix for the battery and the planes took flight again in April.

Meanwhile, other incidents have been reported with the brakes, electrical panels and hydraulics. Despite issues with the 787, Boeing has more than 1,300 orders for the next-generation aircraft.
