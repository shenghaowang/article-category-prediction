A business brief serves different purposes depending on context. It is generally defined as a document that presents reasons why a certain strategy or model will lead to success in a given situation. A business brief is written in a persuasive active voice to persuade clients and companies to invest in your idea or business, similar to the way a legal brief argues on behalf of a client's interests.

Organize your thoughts and make an outline of your brief before you start writing. Remember the purpose of the document is to succinctly persuade your readers to see things from your point of view. Thoroughly research the company and/or executive you plan to target with your brief. Keep the length to two pages, if possible (no more than four).

Be creative. Use relevant quotes and citations to sell your argument. Consider your selling points from an analytical and an emotional angle. If you were in the position of your audience, what kind of information would sway you in the right direction? Pepper your text with action verbs and calls to action.

Use a simple memorandum format. The date should go at the top. Put the target's name next, with his or her title on the following line (/). "To: Grant Farmer / CEO, Farmer Industries."

Include the name of you and your company. For example, "From: John Simmons / Vice President, A and E Advertising."

State the brief's topic, e.g. "Project: Sales campaign for Joe's Deli."

Write a one-paragraph overview that describes the purpose of the business brief. For example, you may be trying to sell something, attract new partners or raise funds for a new venture.

Keep in mind your audience and mention them in your brief, clearly stating how helping you would benefit them.

Present your credentials and what experience you have that qualifies you to have credibility regarding the proposed purpose of the brief.

Explain what it is about your company that makes it specifically ideal to manifest the endeavor put forward in the brief. What has your company done in the past that is relevant to what you are trying to accomplish?

Identify your target customer for the product, promotion or partnership, clearly outlining the demographics for your readers. You want them to envision the customer base and to fully understand the potential earnings to be gained.

Explain what you want from the reader ¡ª exactly what they would be expected to do to make your vision a reality. It should be written so that the readers of your business brief are excited to fulfill this role, and motivated to begin a lucrative relationship with you and/or your company.

Include a timeline that estimates how long it would take to put your business brief's plan into action. Be sure that you have done your homework regarding the business or individual you are soliciting, so that your time frame is realistic.

End on a positive note, emphasizing your strongest argument for your business brief's call to action.
