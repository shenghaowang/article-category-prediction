Sbarro, the private-equity-owned pizza chain, filed for bankruptcy on Monday as it looked to cut its debt and restructure its balance sheet.

The restructuring, according to a court filing, will allow Sbarro to reduce its debt by $195 million, or more than half. The company will also get a $30 million capital infusion.

¡°Sbarro is a strong company with an unsustainable balance sheet,¡± the company said in a court filing. ¡°Sbarro intends to emerge expeditiously from Chapter 11 as a stronger, well capitalized and more competitive company.¡±

Founded in 1956 as a Italian grocery store in Brooklyn, Sbarro evolved into an Italian restaurant chain, with its first mall location in 1967. Today, the company has 1,045 locations in 42 countries.

In 2007, the company was acquired by MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm, with current and senior management retaining a stake. MidOcean, whose executive board includes a former New York governor, George E. Pataki, owns a number of other consumer brands, including the gym chain L.A. Fitness International and the apparel maker totes Isotoner.

Shortly after the buyout, Sbarro got hit by rising food costs and the global economic crisis. The price of ingredients like cheese and flour surged in 2007 and 2008, just as mall traffic began to fall off during the recession.

¡°Price increases and cost-cutting measures taken to combat commodity inflation and maintain earnings during this difficult period contributed to challenges with the brand, and performance lagged the rebound in

 mall traffic beginning in early 2010,¡± the company said in its court filing.

To help revitalize the business, MidOcean Partners installed a new management team last year, including appointing one of its managing directors, Nicholas McGrane, as chief executive. Although the financial situation improved somewhat, the changes were not enough, and Sbarro breached a covenant on one of its loans last year.

Since then, the company has been working with its advisers to ¡°refine their business plan¡± in the hopes of improving ¡°liquidity and overall financial condition.¡± Sbarro has also been negotiating with its creditors.

As part of the reorganization plan, MidOceon and another private equity firm, Ares Management, which owns some of Sbarro¡¯s debt, are committing $30 million in capital. The company expects to earn $30 million in fiscal 2011, down from roughly $38 million last year.

During the bankruptcy proceedings, Sbarro said its locations would continue to operate and customers would still be able to use their gifts cards and coupons.

Sbarro is being advised by Kirkland & Ellis, Rothschild and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
