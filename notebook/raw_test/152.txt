SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) ¡ª Gold futures closed 1% lower on Friday, suffering from their biggest one-day point and percentage loss in more than a week, after a closely-watched jobs report signaled stronger-than-expected employment trends, dulling the metal¡¯s investment appeal.

The U.S. added 175,000 jobs in February, topping the 140,000 positions expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6%, edging up because more people entered the labor force in search of jobs but not all of them found one.

Safety plays like gold and Treasurys fell sharply in the wake of the jobs report.

Gold for April delivery US:GCJ4 fell $13.60, or 1%, to settle at $1,338.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was trading around $1,351, near Thursday¡¯s settlement, immediately before the jobs data. For the week, prices held onto a gain of around 1.3%, based on the most-active contracts, according to FactSet data.

May silver US:SIK4 sank nearly 65 cents, or 3%, to end at $20.93 an ounce following a 1.4% climb a day earlier. Prices have lost about 1.5% week to date.

The jobs number was ¡°not a blockbuster event, [but] it does end a downtrend of the past couple reports and turns around labor participation, which has been at levels last witnessed in the late 1970s,¡± said Jeffrey Wright, managing director at H.C. Wainwright.

The end result is a higher U.S. dollar DXY, -0.36% and gold is moving lower in reaction to that, he said.

The market had also been looking to the economic data for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

¡°Investors were looking for a number that could potentially ¡®taper the taper¡¯ but obviously that concept is completely off the table,¡± especially after New York Fed President William Dudley¡¯s hawkish comments Thursday, said Tyler Richey, an analyst for the 7:00¡¯s Report, which offers daily markets commentary.

Gold is also experiencing a ¡°lack of safe-haven demand,¡± with the situation in Ukraine having stabilized, said Wright. Still, ¡°the end game is not currently clear and gold can still be viewed for safe-haven status in the coming weeks if the situation in Ukraine further degrades.¡±
