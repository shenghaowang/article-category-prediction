There¡¯s a reason that the administrators of Obamacare haven¡¯t revealed how many people who have enrolled were previously uninsured: They don¡¯t know.

Enrollees in the federal exchange and most of the 15 state exchanges are not asked if they had insurance before signing up, CNBC reports.

¡°All applicants who are seeking subsidies must answer questions about future access to insurance, but they are not asked about prior or current coverage,¡± the network reports on its website.

CNBC surveyed the state exchanges and 12 of the 15 replied. Of those, only Kentucky and New York ask applicants if they previously had insurance.

Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it should have been obvious that whether those signing up are uninsured would be a common question.

"A lot of people could have anticipated this is a question everyone would be asking," she said. But it¡¯s still understandable that the information isn¡¯t being collected as program administrators single focus is on signing people up before the March 31 enrollment deadline, not conducting research or an evaluation, she told the network.
