¡°The World¡¯s Most Ethical Companies embrace the correlation between ethical business practice and improved company performance. These companies use ethics as a means to further define their industry leadership and understand that creating an ethical culture and earning the World¡¯s Most Ethical Companies recognition involves more than just an outward facing message or a handful of senior executives saying the right thing,¡± said Ethisphere¡¯s Chief Executive Officer Timothy Erblich. ¡°Earning this recognition involves the collective action of a global workforce from the top down. We congratulate everyone at Avnet for this extraordinary achievement.¡±

The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute¡¯s Ethics Quotient (EQ) framework, developed over years of research to provide a means to assess an organization¡¯s performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. The EQ framework and methodology is determined, vetted and refined by the expert advice and insights gleaned from Ethisphere¡¯s network of thought leaders and from the World¡¯s Most Ethical Company Methodology Advisory Panel.

Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%), and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%).
