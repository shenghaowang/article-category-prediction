Symantec confirms receipt of five director nominations from activist shareholder Starboard

Antivirus software company Symantec Corp. confirmed that it has received five director nominations from activist shareholder Starboard Value. "Symantec maintains open communications with its stockholders and values constructive input that advances the goal of creating value for all stockholders," the company said in a Thursday release. "Over the last several weeks, we have had a dialogue with Starboard and we plan to continue these discussions." The release comes after The Wall Street Journal reported that Starboard has built a roughly 5.8% stake in Symantec and is pushing for change. The stock has fallen 34% in the last year amid an internal audit in response to claims made by a whistleblower. Symantec has not offered details of those claims but has said it does not expect any material impact on past earnings. The company has not yet set a date for its annual shareholder meeting as it awaits the conclusion of the audit. Shares were up 6.2% premarket. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.5%.
