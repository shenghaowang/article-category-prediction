19.49 We're wrapping up our live coverage of today's developments in the search for MH370. We leave you with our latest report Malaysia Airlines MH370: Investigators focus probe on 'deliberate act' by pilots .

19.30 Dr John Blaxland, a senior fellow from Australian National University, has told Chinese state news agency Xinhua that if the measures of the latest object are correct, it could be a wing:

Dr. Blaxland, from ANU's Strategic and Defense Studies Center, said if the measurements of 22 meters long and 13 meters wide are correct, they are more consistent with a wing of a Boeing 777 airliner.

Asked about whether the newly spotted object would be the one spotted in an earlier satellite image, Blaxland said they don't seem to be the same object.

"It's similar shaped, but if the measurements (are correct), then this is slightly wider," he said. ...

The object is said to be 120 km west to the object spotted by American satellite on March 16 which has formed the basis for the current search operation coordinated by Australia.

Blaxland said if that is the case, then the two objects are " highly unlikely" to be the same object or the two wings of the same plane because the ocean current is from west to east.

But in a later email reply to Xinhua, Blaxland said this picture suggests the new imagery is not to the west but in the south of the area currently being patrolled.

"That changes things as it is quite possible that the currents would move, in a swirling pattern, to move the object further south in to the area. If that is the case, then this very well may be the first new evidence of the same object identified on March 16. If that is the case. Tomorrow's surveillance flights will most likely be redirected onto this area," he said.

19.25 Here is the full AMSA statement on the results of today's search and plans for tomorrow:

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority search operation for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has concluded for today.

During Saturday¡¯s search activities a civil aircraft tasked by AMSA reported sighting a number of small objects with the naked eye, including a wooden pallet, within a radius of five kilometres.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion aircraft with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left but only reported sighting clumps of seaweed.

The RNZAF Orion dropped a datum marker buoy to track the movement of the material. A merchant ship in the area has been tasked to relocate and seek to identify the material.

The search area experienced good weather conditions on Saturday with visibility of around 10 kilometres and moderate seas.

The Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, two chartered civil aircraft and two merchant ships supported Saturday¡¯s search effort in a 36,000 square kilometre search area in the Australian Search and Rescue Region.

Since AMSA assumed coordination of the search on Monday 17 March, 15 sorties have been flown and more than 150 hours of air time has been committed by the air crews to the task.

Four military aircraft assisted in today¡¯s search, as well as two ultra-long range jets. Ten State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers from Western Australia were tasked as air observers today, along with two AMSA mission coordinators on the civilian aircraft. AMSA runs a training program across the country to train SES volunteers in air observation for land and sea searches.

The Royal Australian Navy¡¯s HMAS Success has arrived in the search area. Two merchant ships are also in the search area.

The search will resume tomorrow and further attempts will be made to establish whether the objects sighted are related to MH370.

This evening China provided a satellite image to Australia possibly showing a 22.5 metre floating object in the southern Indian Ocean. AMSA has plotted the position and it falls within Saturday¡¯s search area. The object was not sighted on Saturday.

AMSA will take this information into account in tomorrow¡¯s search plans.

18.08 AMSA has released this map showing the locations of both the initial search area and of the latest sighting:

16.21 Now that today's search efforts have been called off, to begin afresh tomorrow with the new lead of the Chinese sighting, let's have a quick reminder of the assets involved in the mission.

In the search zone now:

Three RAAF P3 Orion aircraft, a New Zealand P3 Orion and two long-range commercial jets

14.05 The Australian agency coordinating southern search efforts has issued a statement on the object detected by Chinese satellites. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said the coordinates given fell within the area that they had been searching today.

"AMSA has plotted the position and it falls within Saturday's search area. The object was not sighted on Saturday. AMSA will take this information into account in tomorrow's search plans."

There has been no comment on whether the earlier and the latest objects detected could be one and the same. The larger of the two objects discovered earlier this week was 24m in length, while that announced today by China is said to be 22.5m. But it seems plausible, at least, that measurements taken by distant satellites of items moving in rough seas might have a certain margin of error.

13.45 Watch our latest Telegraph video on today's announcement of the detection of a further floating object in the southern corridor by Chinese satellite imagery:

12.21 Today's efforts in the original Australian search zone have concluded as night falls. It is unclear how the search area might be affected by the recent Chinese announcement - will it be expanded or altered for tomorrow? As yet there has been no word from the Chinese government on the efforts to reach the latest object - we'll update with more as we have it.

12.16 The Telegraph's Jonathan Pearlman reports from Kuala Lumpur on an odd detail thrown up by the latest sighting:

The distance from the newly spotted object from Perth is 1,630 miles (2,620 kilometres). That is strange, as the first set of debris was estimated to be 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometres) away.

The latest images were taken two days after the original images. During this time, according to experts on the Indian Ocean, the objects were expected to head towards Perth rather than away.

Could this indicate that the two sets of objects are unrelated?

12.10 Here's an image of the location of the object spotted by Chinese satellite, at the coordinates 44¡ã57'29.0"S 90¡ã30'43.0"E, via Google Earth:

The object seen by Chinese satellite is marked by the green arrow

12.06 Though attention is focusing on the reports of objects in the southern corridor, it's worth noting that search efforts are still ongoing in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, where northern corridor areas are being re-examined in case of possible clues that might have been missed.

11.53 Here's the latest information from SASTIND, China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, via state news agency Xinhua:

Captured by the high-definition earth observation satellite "Gaofen-1" at around 12 a.m. on March 18 Beijing Time, the imagery spotted the object at 44 degrees, 57 minutes south latitude, and 90 degrees, 13 minutes east longitude, in the southern Indian Ocean, the SASTIND said.

The location of the suspicious object is along the southern corridor missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 might have taken, and about 120 km south by west from the location of a suspicious object Australia found before.

11.03 Our correspondent Jonathan Pearlman in Kuala Lumpur reports on the transcript of the final moments of communication between MH370 and air traffic control, revealed in The Telegraph today:

The transcript of the cockpit communications aboard MH370 was discussed at today¡¯s press briefing, with officials confirming it reveals nothing ¡°abnormal¡± in the communications between the pilots and air traffic controllers.

Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director-general of Malaysia's civil aviation department, said the transcript was ¡°inaccurate¡± but would not clarify how it was inaccurate and declined to release it.

As noted by The Telegraph, the published version was a translation of a Mandarin version, which was a translation of the English original.

The Telegraph has sighted a blurred photo of the English version but could only use it to make out some of the timings. The published version relied on a Chinese version, which was obtained in full from 00:36:30 onwards (the earlier ground communications were paraphrased).

The prime minister¡¯s office would not say today whether it was the transcript¡¯s wording or the timing of communications that was found to be inaccurate.

10.58 According to reports in Chinese state media, the images of the latest object were taken by a Chinese satellite at around midday on Tuesday, around 120km from where the Australian government announced a sighting on Thursday.

The satellite images were reportedly captured on Tuesday

10.50 Al-Jazeera is reporting that this latest object has been spotted around 120km from those seen earlier this week, though it is not clear where this information comes from.

10.46 There has been some confusion about the size of the object spotted by Chinese satellite, originally said to be 22m by 30m but now confirmed by the Malaysian government to be 22m by 13m. "This information was received by phone during the press conference, and was initially misheard," the ministry said.

10.30 Following the dramatic turn of events at this morning's press conference in Malaysia, let's have a look at what we know - and what we don't - about this latest sighting.

- Chinese authorities have received satellite imagery of possible debris floating in the southern corridor

- It is not known how many objects have been sighted but one of them is large at 22m by 13m

- It is unclear whether the images were picked up by Chinese satellite or passed to the Chinese government by another satellite operator

- No details have been given as to the location of the debris, apart from that it is floating in the southern corridor. It is unclear whether it is in the same area as the other objects spotted 2,300km south west of Perth

Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein received a note with the new information during this morning's press briefing

10.00 BREAKING: The Malaysian transport minister has just broken off from the press conference to report that the Chinese authorities have obtained satellite images of another object in the southern Indian Ocean, this one 22 metres by 30 metres. Ships are being dispatched and the Chinese government is to give a statement in a couple of hours. More to follow.

09.55 Here is this morning's press statement from the Malaysian government in full:

MH370 PRESS BRIEFING BY HISHAMMUDDIN HUSSEIN, MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND ACTING MINISTER OF TRANSPORT

Diplomatic, logistical and technical efforts continue in the search for MH370. As we intensify the search and rescue operations, the overall emphasis remains the same: using all available means to narrow the search areas in both corridors.

In the northern corridor, in response to diplomatic notes, we can confirm that China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have verbally informed the search and rescue operation that, based on preliminary analysis, there have been no sightings of the aircraft on their radar.

With respect to the southern corridor, today two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76s will arrive in Perth to begin operations. The Shaanxi Y-8 which arrived yesterday will be operating from Subang air base in Malaysia. China is also sending an additional two ships from the Andaman Sea to join the five Chinese ships already in the southern corridor.

Two Indian aircraft, a P-8 Poseidon and C-130 Hercules, arrived in Malaysia at 18:00 last night to assist with the search.

HMS Echo is currently in the Persian Gulf and is en route to the southern corridor. The ship is equipped with advanced sensors that allow it to search effectively underwater.

Five aircraft and two merchant ships were involved in the search and rescue operations in the vicinity of the objects identified by the Australian authorities, which are approximately 2,500km southwest of Perth. Despite improved visual search conditions yesterday, there were no sightings of the objects of interest.

Operations continue, and today they plan to search an area of approximately 10,500 square nautical miles.

The Rescue Co-ordination Centre Australia anticipates that 6 aircraft, 4 military and 2 civilian, will be visually searching the area. Two merchant vessels will also be present during search operations, and HMAS Success was due to reach the search area at 14:30 today.

Generally, conditions in the southern corridor are very challenging. The ocean varies between 1,150 metres and 7,000 metres in depth. In the area where the possible objects were identified by the Australian authorities there are strong currents and rough seas.

A cyclone warning has been declared for Tropical Cyclone Gillian, which is located in the southern corridor. Very strong winds and rough seas are expected there today.

The briefing for families in KL yesterday went well. The briefing in Beijing, however, was less productive. Despite the best intentions, I understand there were tense scenes.

I have received a report from the Malaysian high-level team, as well as a copy of the declaration from the Chinese families. I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the authorities in China, to investigate what happened.

We will continue to engage with the families. We are working hard with Chinese authorities and the Chinese working group to create a more conducive environment for the briefings. I have instructed my technical team to do a review of both briefings so that we can improve them.

We appeal to all parties to be understanding during this extraordinary and difficult time. My pledge to all the families, wherever they are, is the same: we will do everything in our power to keep you informed.

The original transcript of the conversation between MH370 and Malaysian air traffic control is with the investigations team, where it is being analysed.

As is standard practice in investigations of this sort, the transcript cannot be publicly released at this stage. I can however confirm that the transcript does not indicate anything abnormal.

On the matter of MH370¡¯s cargo, the cargo manifest is with the investigations team, and will be released in due course.

Preliminary investigation of the cargo manifest has not shown any link to anything that might have contributed to MH370¡¯s disappearance.

As was stated yesterday, all cargo carried on MH370 was in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organisation and International Air Transport Association standards.

Over the past two weeks, the search for MH370 has taken many twists and turns. From satellite images to eyewitness accounts, we have followed every lead and investigated every possibility.

Today we are focused on leads from the satellite images announced by the Australian authorities on Thursday. We continue to be updated by the Australian authorities on an hourly basis.

I know this rollercoaster has been incredibly hard for everyone, especially for the families. We hope and pray this difficult search will be resolved, and bring closure to those whose relatives were on board.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all 26 countries who are with us in this effort; from ordinary people to the highest levels of government.

I would also like to pay special tribute to the men and women from all countries who are putting themselves in harm¡¯s way in the search for MH370.

As we speak, people are sailing through a cyclone to help find the missing plane. We are immensely grateful to all our partners for their efforts.

09.53 More details on logistics for the southern search operation:

"Today two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76s will arrive in Perth to begin operations. The Shaanxi Y-8 which arrived yesterday will be operating from Subang air base in Malaysia. China is also sending an additional two ships from the Andaman Sea to join the five Chinese ships already in the southern corridor.

"Two Indian aircraft, a P-8 Poseidon and C-130 Hercules, arrived in Malaysia at 18:00 last night to assist with the search.

"HMS Echo is currently in the Persian Gulf and is en route to the southern corridor. The ship is equipped with advanced sensors that allow it to search effectively underwater."

09.51 Malaysian officials say that a number of countries along the northern corridor have now confirmed that their radars have not picked up any evidence of the missing plane. "We can confirm that China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have all verbally informed the search and rescue operation that, based on preliminary analysis, there have been no sightings of the aircraft on their radar."

09.45 Malaysia says it may revert to searching the two corridors - northern and southern - if the objects spotted 2,300km south west of Perth are not found to be from MH370.

09.44 Malaysian officials are holding their daily press briefing in Kuala Lumpur on developments in the search. The transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein has confirmed that six planes are searching an area of 10,500 square nautical kilometres today. But weather conditions are once again complicating efforts - a cyclone warning for Tropical Cyclone Gillian has been issued in the southern corridor, with high winds and rough seas expected, the minister says.

09.09 India has formally told Malaysian investigators that it has found no evidence MH370 flew through its airspace, Reuters has reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

It had been hoped that radar data from India could help determine whether the aircraft went north or south from its last known position. The issue was sensitive because of the presence of military radar and Malaysia was required to submit a diplomatic request to India to check for any sign that the plane had touched its airspace. India has now responded, saying it has found nothing of significance.

The news leaves the investigation dependent on increasingly fragile hopes that an object spotted in the southern Indian Ocean comes from Flight MH370.

08.46 Chinese police have been forced to intervene as family members waiting at a Beijing hotel rushed at Malaysian officials demanding answers over the fate of their loved ones.

As the search enters a third week, many relatives of the missing believe that Malaysian officials are holding back information and have alleged a cover-up. Heated exchanges have taken place at several of the daily briefings given to families.

At the Lido hotel in Beijing today, audience members shouted: "Government of Malaysia, tell us the truth! Give us back our loved ones!"

"The Malaysian government is deceiving us. They don't dare to face us. The Malaysian government are the biggest murderers," a relative in the audience shouted, even though there is no evidence to suggest a government conspiracy.

As anger in the hall mounted, some relatives rushed towards the Malaysian officials but police intervened and the officials left the room.

"We can't bear it any longer," one woman said. "They're offering us compensation, but we've lost our entire families. This is China. They can't just tell us to come or go as they please. We're going to wait here. If they don't come, we're not leaving."

08.40 Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein has expressed fears that the debris spotted in the southern Indian ocean might never be located by searchers. He noted that time was running out, as the "black box" voice and data recorder only transmits an electronic signal for about 30 days before its battery dies.

"I am still quite concerned that - it's been two days - and yet the searches have not come out with any debris," he said.

"I am not going to give up... My biggest concern is that we are not able to identify the debris, having to go back to the two corridors."

08.35 As the relatives of the missing grapple with their worst fears, Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman John Young has said the operation is still considered one of search and rescue.

"The plan is we want to find these objects because they are the best lead to where we might find people to be rescued," he said.

08.30 Good morning and welcome to today's live coverage of the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Here's a quick recap of events yesterday and overnight:

The search is continuing in an area in the southern Indian Ocean, 2,300 km south west of Perth, where attention focused on Thursday after two large objects were spotted floating in the sea on satellite imagery. Six planes from Australia and other countries have been deployed to scour the area, but at four hours' flying time from Perth, the area is so remote that the craft have can only spend two to three hours searching before having to return to base.

Deputy Australian PM Warren Truss has confirmed that so far today no sign of the missing plane has been found. Speaking at a press conference he said he remained hopeful that Australian search crews would be able to locate debris from the plane if it exists. He warned the parts spotted on satellite may have either drifted or sunk by now, "but it's the best lead we have."

"If there's something there to be found I'm confident this search will find it," he said.

"We have a responsibly to do what we can to find this aircraft. The search will continue on until it's futile to continue. That day hasn't come."

AMSA, the Australian body coordinating the search for the plane, has released a map of its planned search area for today. The search zone has been slightly expanded.

The search area for today has been slightly enlarged

The Norwegian cargo vessel Hoegh St. Petersburg, with a Filipino crew of 20, is also in the area and a small flotilla of ships from China is on its way, though not expected to arrive for several days. Two Chinese and two Japanese aircraft are expected to arrive in Perth over the weekend and the US has been asked to send undersea surveillance equipment to help search for the debris amid suggestions that it may have sunk.

This could of course be another of the false leads that have raised hopes so often throughout the search.

The Australian authorities have cautioned that the objects could be debris from a container ship, though one of the objects - at 24 metres long - is too large to be a container.

Meanwhile the investigation into the possible cause of the disappeareance goes on, amid increasing frustration from passengers' relatives. Malaysia Airlines in particular has repeatedly come under fire for what families say is poor handling of the affair.

According to the Daily Mail the CEO of Malaysia Airlines has now said the missing jet was carrying highly flammable lithium batteries, four days after denying it.

The Telegraph has an exclusive story on the transcript of the final communication between the Malaysia Airlines flight cockpit and ground control.

The cockpit communication aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight has been revealed, from its taxi on the runway to its final message at 1.19am of 'all right, good night'. The transcript starts at 00.25 with general instructions from the control tower to the pilots. The detailed conversation begins at 00.36. Here is an excerpt from our story:

A transcript of conversations between the co-pilot and the control tower, and other air traffic controllers, runs from the time the Boeing 777 was taxiing to its last known position thousands of feet above the South China Sea.

Analysts said the sequence of messages appeared ¡°perfectly routine¡±. However two features, they said, stood out as potentially odd.
