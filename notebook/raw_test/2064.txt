Two marijuana-related bills are becoming law Monday in Colorado.

The new laws are minor adjustments to the sweeping pot regulations adopted last year.

The first measure requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

The second measure allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already must have state-level background checks, so the change is not expected to add any additional work for the CBI.

Gov. John Hickenlooper planned to sign the new laws Monday at the Capitol.
