The top trending ticker today is Gamestop. The video game retailer is getting zapped after the 800-pound gorilla in the retail world, Walmart, announced that it would start buying back used video games. Walmart¡¯s CMO said starting March 26th, customers at 3,100 stores will be able to trade in Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo games. Credit from the trade-ins can be used immediately towards purchasing anything at Walmart, and Walmart intends to pay more for used games than other other buyer, including Gamestop.

 The used video game market is huge for Gamestop, as it has dominated the space for the past 15 years, returning $1 billion in trade-in credits to customers just last year. Used games accounts for 30% of Gamestop¡¯s annual sales, and nearly 40% of its profits. With Walmart setting its sights on this lucrative business, Gamestop fans are hoping it won¡¯t be "GAME OVER" for the video game purveyor.
