FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW , the world's largest premium carmaker, sees no reason why its core car business cannot achieve an operating profit margin next year in line with its targeted range of 8-10 percent, the company's finance chief said on Tuesday. "We still haven't even finished our planning for 2013 at this point, so we cannot make a concrete statement. We continue to expect that this corridor of 8-10 percent will be stable, also for 2013, I would like to emphasize that," Friedrich Eichiner told a conference call with reporters.
