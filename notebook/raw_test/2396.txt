The vessel will use radar to search the area overnight, and its crew will use binoculars and their own eyesight to scan the waters Friday. Australia's HMAS Success is also en route.

The four planes were checking to see if two large objects spotted in satellite imagery bobbing in the ocean were debris from Fight 370 that went missing March 8 with 239 people on board.

Australian authorities said the first plane to reach the area was unable to locate the debris through clouds and rain, but that other planes would continue the hunt. The planes will return to search by air on Friday.

One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery was 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in the area, a four-hour flight from Australia's southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's emergency response division.

"This is a lead, it's probably the best lead we have right now," Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.

An Australian aircraft that's been in the area where two large objects have been spotted in the water southwest of Perth has just arrived back at the Royal Australian Airforce base in Western Australia.

Meanwhile, a merchant ship is steaming towards the spot in the southern Indian Ocean where the large objects that could be debris from the missing Malaysian Airlines plane have been spotted.

But while the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) says the objects are their best lead so far, they caution that they might prove to have nothing to do with flight MH370.

An RAAF aircraft arrived at the area just before 2pm (AEDT) and three more military aircraft, including two from the United States and New Zealand, are expected to reach the area later on today.

In AMSA's experience there was usually debris floating in that area, but on this occasion the size, and the fact that there were a number, made it worth looking at, he said.

"We may get a sighting, we may not. We may get it tomorrow, we may not," he said.

"But we will continue to do this until we locate those objects or we are convinced that we cannot find them."
