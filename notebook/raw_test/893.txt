Had a game last night where I extracted after being downed. When I pick that hunter for a new game he only starts with one health bar.

I know when you get downed in-game you lose it for the remainder of the game, but I thought you'd get it back the next game. Might as well just kill off that guy if I can only start with 50 hp :/

Anyone know if that's the way it's supposed to work or if it's a bug that I should report?
