Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has adopted a new trade-in policy that will allow customers to exchange used video games for any in-store product, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Beginning on March 26, Wal-Mart and Sam¡¯s Club stores will accept used console video games for credit that can be used toward groceries, tech, and other products.

¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡¯¡¯ said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart US, in a statement.

While stores like GameStop and Best Buy have trade-in policies for video games and other tech, Wal-Mart is among the first to offer credit for unrelated products. Shoppers can use credit to make purchases in-store and online.

Traded-in games will be refurbished and sold later this year, according to Reuters.
