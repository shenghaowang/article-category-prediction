The 2 coin could come under attack by Chinese forgers, it has been warned.

The coins which are bi-metallic, containing gold and silver components, were thought to be more difficult to forge than simpler designs such as the 1 coin.

But now a major seizure of 500,000 of euro coins has raised fears that Britain's 2 - with it's relatively higher value - could be in the forger's sights.

Italian detectives stumbled across the treasure trove of contraband currency while inspecting a consignment of metal pipes in the port of Naples.

The seizure was one of the most significant haul of fake coins in European history.

The quality of the coins suggested that the gang is producing imitations of such high quality that they would even be accepted in vending machines, potentially costing businesses thousands in lost revenue.

Fake coins do not usually exercise authorities as much as the production of illicit banknotes because of their relatively low value and the overheads associated with their production.

One forgery investigator told The Times: ¡°Counterfeit coins are not of great interest to most jurisdictions, and certainly not on any list of priorities.¡±

¡°Many types of counterfeit goods follow this route, China to Italy for further distribution, and it seems an entirely feasible enterprise.¡±

A spokesman for the Royal Mint stressed that forgeries of 2 coins are not yet though to be commonplace.

"A bi-colour coin is much harder to counterfeit because replicating the two metal components, the inner and outer, is significantly more difficult than a single component coin. Forgers would also require a highly sophisticated press to produce bi-colour coins," said the spokesman.

"The coin detector mechanism of vending machines and self-service check-outs can detect the two different metal components, in addition to the conductivity, thickness and diameter of the coin."

"The addition of edge lettering is also very hard to counterfeit, and some circulating 2 coin designs also include a latent feature in their elements which is difficult to replicate."
