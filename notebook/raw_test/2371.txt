Kimberly-Clark Tumbles Most in Two Years on Cost, Tax Outlook

Investors reacted negatively after incoming Chief Executive Officer Michael Hsu, who was appointed to the post just this morning, said in a conference call that the cost outlook for 2019 was looking tough, according to Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis. The company forecast its tax rate would increase to as high as 26 percent next year, up from 21 percent to 22 percent this year. Kimberly-Clark reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 for the third quarter, beating the average estimate of $1.63 among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
