In many states, more than half of the uninsured are ineligible for help

Of those, 2.6 million fall into the coverage gap.

Those are people who make less than the federal poverty line but live in one of the 19 states such as Texas and Florida that decided not to expand Medicaid after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made that part of the law optional for states. Because the ACA assumed those people would be covered under Medicaid, the law doesn¡¯t give them subsidies either.

The poorest slip through the cracks in states that didn't expand Medicaid

Note: Wisconsin offers Medicaid to adults up to 100% of the federal poverty line under a waiver but did not adopt the ACA expansion; Maine isn¡¯t included because it did not have sufficient data

An additional 3 million of the uninsured don¡¯t qualify for subsidies because they make too much money¡ªabout $96,000 for a family of four. And 4.5 million aren¡¯t eligible because they¡¯re offered insurance through work. It¡¯s possible they can¡¯t afford that insurance, but there¡¯s no way to tell from the data.

Under federal law, undocumented immigrants aren¡¯t eligible for ACA plans. Kaiser estimates that they account for 20 percent of the uninsured, or about 5.4 million people. A big chunk of them are in states like California, Florida, and New Jersey.
