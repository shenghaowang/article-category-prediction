The unemployment rate in Southwest Florida edged upward by nearly a half-percentage point in January to 6.1 percent ¡ª the result of post-holiday job cuts coupled with more workers looking for jobs. 



But analysts were buoyed by the numbers because they reflected positive economic movement.



¡°We know there were employers hiring only for the holiday season and that those workers have been laid off,¡± said Margie Genter, who oversees eight Goodwill Job Connection offices in Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee and DeSoto counties. ¡°But we also know there are more jobs available, so that people who had given up their job search are coming back into the job market.¡±



Statistics released Monday by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity show that more people, encouraged by what they consider an improving labor market, have re-entered the job pool at a time when payroll positions also are on the rise.



At the end of January, the labor force in the three-county area was 385,813, up 3,754 workers from a month earlier. 



At the same time, payrolls got a little bigger. The number of employed workers rose by 2,040, to 362,286.



Statewide, the department reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.1 percent, down two-tenths of a point from a revised December rate of 6.3 percent and nearly 2 percentage points better than the 8 percent of a year earlier.



Florida, overall, has added nearly 193,000 jobs in the last year. That was third best in the nation, trailing just Texas and California, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 



In issuing figures for January, the state also revised its numbers for 2013, replacing rougher survey numbers with more accurate job counts.



That yearly process, called bench-marking, showed Florida payrolls at 7.68 million at year end, up 35,600 from an earlier estimate.



Economists were generally encouraged by the report.



¡°Two-thousand thirteen looked better than it did originally, as far as job creation,¡± said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida. 



The year-end numbers ¡°confirm our story line, which has been a positive outlook, a fairly strong rebound in Florida and in the Sarasota area as well,¡± said Mekael Teshome, an economist at PNC Financial Services who tracks Florida¡¯s economy.



He said housing and consumer spending, which have led Florida¡¯s recovery, should continue to do well.



¡°But we are now seeing more balanced growth, across industries both small and large,¡± Teshome said.



Demand for workers has continued to grow even as the statewide and regional unemployment rate has hovered around 6 percent for months.



¡°There has definitely been an upshift, a swing, where we are seeing more employers, even those we worked with in years past, come forward and start to hire,¡± said Jennifer Kochilaris, regional vice president for job placement firm Adecco USA. ¡°That shows us the trend is continuing on the right path here in Sarasota.¡± 



Manufacturing has been a bright spot for the region¡¯s economy, as well.



¡°In this area, production is booming," said Nancee Sussman, who runs the Sarasota office of Swanson Staffing. ¡°We are seeing them starting second and third shifts, which is good.¡±



Construction, too, has come back significantly.



Home builders are finding workers ¡°are not available in this area in the quantities that we need,¡± said Alan Anderson, executive vice president of the Manatee-Sarasota Building Industry Association. ¡°Electricians, dry-wallers, HVAC, plumbers. There are some framing concerns as well.¡±



Local builders are having a tough time competing now with other markets nationally for skilled trades, especially because so many of those workers left the region during the housing crash, Anderson said.



Florida added 32,700 construction jobs in the 12 months ended in January, more than any other state, according to data released Monday by the Associated General Contractors of America. 



But 37 other states grew their construction payrolls in the year¡¯s first month as well, the association said.



¡°Especially considering the fact that many parts of the country experienced very harsh weather in January, these construction jobs figures are particularly robust,¡± said Ken Simonson, the association¡¯s chief economist.



In Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties, more than 23,500 residents were looking for work in January, statistics show.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent, as compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County¡¯s rate rose by a 0.5 percentage point to 6.2 percent, from 5.7 percent.



Manatee experienced the smallest increase and had the region¡¯s lowest jobless rate in January: 5.9 percent, as compared with 5.8 percent in December.

EARLIER: The unemployment rate in Southwest Florida climbed nearly a half-percentage point during January to 6.1 percent, likely the result of job cuts following the holiday season and more workers looking for jobs. 



Unemployed workers who are not actively looking for a job are not counted in the unemployment rate. That has been responsible for part of the significant decline in the jobless rate during the recovery from the Great Recession: discouraged workers who have given up.



But evidence that more workers might be looking was found in the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity's total work force count for the region released on Monday.



There were 385,813 people counted, up nearly 1 percent, or 3,754, from the same tally in December.



The state counted 23,527 workers looking for work in January for the 6.1 percent unemployment figure. The jobless rate was 5.7 percent during December.



The biggest increase in the January rate was in Sarasota County, which climbed 0.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent compared with 5.6 percent in December.



Charlotte County rate rose 0.5 percentage points to 6.2 percent from 5.7 percent.



Manatee saw the smallest increase and had the region's lowest jobless rate during January: 5.9 percent compared with 5.8 percent in December.
