GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has had a challenging time from attacks on its business on all fronts ¡ª online sales, freemium games versus premium games, and big-box retail efforts. Now its shares were getting bruised on Tuesday on news that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is directly targeting the GameStop model with a new push with its trade-in service and preowned game offerings.

Walmart said in its press release that it wants to offer the 110 million-plus gamers in the United States a new way to unlock value in their current purchases and to save on video game spending. Walmart said:

Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

Walmart even said that it is ¡°actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity.¡± And as far as the GameStop targeting, the company may not have been named directly but Walmart said:

What matters here is that some 3,100 stores will participate, and even more importantly that the credit can be used on the purchase of any merchandise at Walmart and Sam¡¯s stores. GameStop¡¯s used vide game turn-in credit for customers is for GameStop purchases.

As far as what the market thinks about the new competition, it isn¡¯t pretty. GameStop shares were down more than 5% and were still down closer to 4.4% at $38.00 on last look.

GameStop shares have traded in a 52-week range of $24.89 to $57.74, and the consensus price target prior to this news was just above $50.00.

So, can GameStop survive this effort? Most likely yes, but with some pain and competition.
