The state¡¯s seasonally adjusted jobless rate dropped 0.4 percent to 6.4 percent in January, from 6.8 percent in December, and is now at the lowest point since September 2008, when it stood at 6.3 percent, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) said today.

The Indiana¡¯s unemployment rate remains below all neighboring states and is now lower than the national rate by 0.2 percent, DWD added. ¡°Prior to the benchmarking process, the last time Indiana's rate was lower than the national rate was June of 2012.¡±

Even so, despite a gain of 4,600 jobs in the manufacturing sector, Indiana shed a total of 7,100 private sector jobs in January, ¡°mainly due to the extreme nature of the winter season, which has been cited by the U.S. Federal Reserve as one of the chief causes of employment contraction throughout the country,¡± DWD said.

¡°There are many positives to note this month,¡± DWD Commissioner Scott Sanders said. ¡°Indiana's unemployment rate is not only lower than our neighboring states, but the national rate as well. In addition, 2,700 Hoosiers returned to the labor force and fewer were unemployed in January than at any time since August of 2008, causing our rate to fall almost one-half of a percentage point in one month.¡±

Sanders also noted that Indiana's 2013 total private-sector job growth number was revised upward by 8,200 jobs to 50,800 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and that despite the extreme winter weather, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were nearly 6,000 below January 2013 levels.

Sectors showing gains in January included manufacturing (+4,600); financial activities (+1,400); and professional and business services (+200).

Sectors showing decline in January included trade, transportation and utilities (-4,900); construction (-4,300); private educational and health services (-2,100); and leisure and hospitality (-600).
