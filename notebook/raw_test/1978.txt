It's another fun day for biotech stocks, as my colleague Brendan Conway has pointed out, thanks to a letter from three Democrats to GileadSciences (GILD), which raises pricing concerns about Sovaldi.

That news has dragged down the entire biotech sectors, with Gilead falling 3.4% to $72.97 at 11:41 a.m. today, Amgen (AMGN) dropping 1.9% to $124.60, Celgene (CELG) declining 2.2% to $146.74, Biogen Idec (BIIB) dropping 4.5% to $331.61 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) falling 5.4% to $164.21.

Amidst all the noise, Barclays' Ying Huang and team raised their price target for Amgen to $130 from $115. They explain why:

In the wake of changes to ACC/AHA clinical guidelines for treatment of elevated cholesterol for prevention of [cardiovascular] events, there has been heightened uncertainly around the size of the revenue opportunity [for anti-cholesterol drugs that target proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, also known as PCSK9 ]. Despite anxiety around the shift of focus of clinical guidelines from LDL-C goals to [cardiovascular] outcomes, we see this as a net positive for the class. Increased focus on the use of statins and on maxing out statin dose will drive an increase in intolerant or insufficient responders to statins. We estimate the most likely scenario - approval for these two populations of statin-experienced patients, along with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) ¨C to yield a peak revenue opportunity in 2020 of $7-$8 billion for anti-PCSK9 as a class. Investors, however, might be questioning the revenue opportunity for all biotech drugs after three Democrats asked Gilead Sciences why it has to charge so much for Sovaldi. RBC Capital Markets' Michael Yee and team think the fears are overblown. He explains: This seems like a lot of political gesturing but unlikely to turn into any real change. Bottom-line, we are buyers of this recent weakness and in our layman's view, we believe they are encouraging [Gilead Sciences] to reach pricing concessions especially for economically disadvantaged patients. This is not the same as an attempt to curb or regulate pricing of pharmaceuticals. Shares of Gilead have dropped 2.5% so far this year, while Amgen has gained 9.3%, Celgene has fallen 13%, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has climbed 24% and Biogen Idec, whose hemophilia drug Alprolix won Canadian approval, has advanced 19%.
