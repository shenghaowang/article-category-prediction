Despite an uptick in refinance activity at Freddie Mac, monthly conventional refinance originations declined to the slowest pace in at least three years.

 

 Refinances of residential loans that are owned or guaranteed by either Fannie Mae or Freddie totaled 138,329 during January.

 

 It was the lowest level of refinance activity since at least 2010, the oldest date that monthly data is available for government-sponsored enterprise refinances.
