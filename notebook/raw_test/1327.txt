The Telegraph is reporting that it has obtained the final 54 minutes of communication records from missing Malaysia Flight 370.

The report focuses on two parts of the communication. During one portion, a message from the cockpit repeats that they were cruising at 35,000 feet. In another portion, the plane lost contact and changed direction just as there was a changeover among air traffic controllers, according to the UK paper.

An international search effort is underway to find the missing jetliner. There were 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board when the Boeing 777 lost contact on March 8. This week, the search has focused on a remote area of the Indian Ocean after two large objects, possibly debris, were spotted by a satellite.
