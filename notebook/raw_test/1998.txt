Did Wal-Mart just put out of business? That's the question buzzing around Tuesday morning on the heels of news that the superstore chain is re-starting its video game trade-in program, a move that positions the retailer to take a huge bite out of GameStop's core business strategy. As a result of the speculation, shares of GameStop are down about 6% in early morning trading.

Wal-Mart announced Tuesday morning that starting March 26, customers will be able to trade in their old video games in exchange for gift cards that can be used towards any Walmart or Sam's Club purchase, in stores or online. Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide and accepting games used on consoles like the PlayStation3 and Xbox 360, the move marks a direct threat to GameStop, whose 6,488 stores do significant business in the pre-owned video game category. In its third fiscal quarter in January, GameStop said it saw pre-owned sales increase 7% to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season, or 18% of all holiday sales. GameStop also said in January that gross margins for the pre-owned category are expected to range from 46% to 49% for both its fourth quarter and its full fiscal year.

Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S, acknowledged that the company is "actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," saying that gaming is important category to Wal-Mart. ¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They¡¯ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,¡± Mac Naughton said in a statement Tuesday morning.

It's worth noting that this is Wal-Mart's second attempt at entering the pre-owned video game market; in 2009, the superstore chain introduced kiosks that customers could use to trade in their old video games, but the program failed to work and was suspended in 2010. More recently the retailer was quietly accepting trade-ins online, but in partnering with CE Exchange, the company behind Wal-Mart's tablet and smartphone trade-in program, Wal-Mart is clearly hoping this newest attempt at capturing the pre-owned video game market will be more successful.

It remains to be seen if Wal-Mart's new program is appealing to hard-core gamers, who often trade in old games just to buy new ones -- and not things like clothes or sports equipment or other Wal-Mart products. If enough video game customers aren't interested in Walmart or Sam's Club dollars, GameStop could very well emerge from this test unscathed.

Following Wal-Mart's announcement, shares of GameStop initially sank more than 7% in Tuesday's pre-market trading session; the stock is currently down about 6.3%. Year-to-date, the video game retailer has trailed the market, posting a near-20% decline for 2014 thus far. It finished 2013 trading with a 92% return. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, was relatively unmoved in Tuesday's pre-market trading: the stock is currently down just .08%. Year-to-date, the superstore is down 5.4%.
