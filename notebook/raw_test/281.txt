Amid mounting evidence that the disappearance of the Malaysian plane was a deliberate act, authorities today said the last words from the cockpit were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot as covering 11 countries were intensified.

Evidence indicating that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that went 10 days ago was sabotaged or hijacked was mounting after it emerged that the last message from the cockpit was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane's automatic tracking systems.

The last words -- "All right, good night" -- were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot.

"Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke," Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a media briefing.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid are under scanner of the probe into the disappearance of the plane.

The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot's final words.

The officials are also looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian - had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.

Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations."
