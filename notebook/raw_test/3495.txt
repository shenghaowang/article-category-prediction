Here are some things going on this morning in your world of tech:

It's a big morning for initial public offerings. The Nasdaq is welcoming a few new tech names, Borderfree (BRDR), Amber Road (AMBR), and A10 Networks (ATEN), and cloud computing looms large with them.

Borderfree runs a cloud "platform" for cross-border e-commerce, according to its prospectus. It lost $654,000 on revenue of $110 million last year.

Amber Road bills itself as a facilitator of "global trade management," via the cloud, according to its prospectus, as a global supply chain, offering a "proprietary knowledgebase" of regulatory rules to help automate trade management for companies. It lost $14.4 million last year on revenue of $52.5 million.

A10 Networks is a vendor of so-called "application delivery controllers," and has been in litigation in past with the dominant vendor in that market, F5 Networks (FFIV). It lost $27,096 last year on revenue of $141.7 million, according to its prospectus.

Shares of Borderfree are up $3.50, or 22%, at $19.50, after pricing at $16. Amber Road is up $3.87, or almost 30%, at $16.87, after pricing at $13. And A10 shares are up just 9 cents, at $15.09, after opening at $13.85, below the $15 price of the IPO. A10's shares were delayed for a while this morning, and CNBC's Bob Pisani, noting the unusual circumstances, reported the company was in some last-minute haggling with the Securities & Exchange Commission about its filings.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) are up 77 cents at $529.47, after Macquarie USA Equities Research's Ben Schachter initiated the stock with an Outperform rating, and a $630 price target, writing that the iTunes business and other software and services are "under appreciated businesses" that he thinks "will be a key profit growth driver" in future, rising from 8% of sales and about 12% of Ebitda in 2012 to 13% of sales and nearly 30% of total Ebitda by 2016. "By 2020, it could drive almost 40% of all Apple profits."

"The bottom line is that while Apple's current hardware businesses face many challenges and new product introductions remain uncertain, its high-margin iTunes/Software/Services businesses will drive profit growth," writes Schachter, combined with "its substantial cash position, cash generating abilities, and new opportunities."

Shares of Symantec (SYMC) are down $2.93, or almost 14%, at $17.98, after the company yesterday afternoon abruptly announced it terminated CEO Steve Bennett, saying it needed new management to "driver on the next stage of Symantec's product innovation and growth.

The stock has gotten gotten five downgrades this morning, that I can see, from Jefferies & Co., R.W. Baird, UBS, MKM Partners, and Cowen & Co.

Cowen's Gregg Moskowitz, cutting his rating to Market Perform from Outperform, writes of Bennett "His strategy was, in our view, necessarily far-reaching, and some disruption had always been inevitable. Nonetheless, the impact to bookings over the last two quarters had been more painful than most, including us, had expected."

Moskowitz concludes "We continue to believe 30%+ op. margins by FY17 is very achievable; however, given the changing of the guard, our prior view that SYMC could be a mid 30s op. margin company in 3-4 years no longer holds. We also continue to be very skeptical of SYMC's 5%+ growth target, regardless of how much increased emphasis SYMC may opt to place on this going forward."

On the other hand, Citigroup's Walter Pritchard, reiterating a Buy rating, and a $28 price target, writes that "shares are cheap and investor sentiment is worst in our space," with the stock at eight times cash flow. "While fundamentals may have taken a turn for the worst, we note that our FCF (unlevered) estimate for FY14 ($1.28B) is below average of last year's ($1.48B) and looks reasonable to us."
