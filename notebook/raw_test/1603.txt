Sharp rise in worldwide sales volume expected

 EBIT margin target: 8 每 10% in Automotive segment

 Group profit before tax also forecast to increase sharply

BMW Group can look ahead with confidence to the current financial year. Group profit before tax and sales volume are both expected to rise to new high levels.

※We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles§, stated Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG at the Annual Accounts Press Conference on Wednesday in Munich.

The planned growth in sales volume should also be reflected in group profit before tax (2013:  7,913 million): ※We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year despite ongoing volatile business conditions§, continued Reithofer. The pace at which earnings increase will however be affected by high levels of expenditure for new technologies and by rising personnel expenses.

Despite substantial levels of investment in new technologies, the Automotive segment will again strive in 2014 to achieve an EBIT margin within a corridor of 8 to 10% (2013: 9.4%). Tailwind will also come from the 16 new models and model revisions, which the BMW Group plans to launch in the current year.

Despite challenging conditions on international motorcycle markets, sales of the Motorcycles segment are forecast to be slightly up on the previous year (2013: 115,215 units), not least due to the contribution expected from the new motorcycles presented at the autumn trade fairs (the R nineT, S 1000 R, R 1200 RT, R 1200 GS Adventure and K 1600 GTL Exclusive).

The Financial Services segment is expected to also remain on growth course in 2014. As a consequence of growth-related investments, the return on equity is likely to decrease slightly (2013: 20.2%), but still surpass the BMW Group＊s minimum required level of 18%.

The forecasts for the current year are based on the assumption that political and economic conditions remain stable in 2014.

The BMW Group continued to perform well during the past year within a challenging economic environment worldwide and successfully maintained its position as the world＊s leading premium manufacturer. ※We have recorded our highest ever sales volume and group profit figures for 2013 and achieved all the targets we set ourselves for the full year§, pointed out Reithofer.

Group revenues for 2013 totalled  76,058 million (2012:  76,848 million;

 -1.0%) and were thus marginally down on the previous year, with the difference due to exchange rate developments. Group profit before tax (EBT) increased by 1.4% to a new high of  7,913 million (2012:  7,803 million) despite increased investment in new technologies, greater competition and higher personnel costs. Group net profit climbed by 4.5% to  5,340 million (2012:  5,111 million), also a new record figure for the BMW Group.

Capital expenditure increased year-on-year by 27.6% to  6,687 million (2012:  5,240 million), giving a capital expenditure ratio of 8.8%. The main focus in 2013 was on product investments for production start-ups (including the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer) and infrastructure-related investments to enable further growth.

Research and development expenditure rose by 21.3% to  4,792 million (2012:  3,952 million), as a result of which the research and development ratio climbed to 6.3% (2012: 5.1%). Important areas of investment were the renewal and expansion of the product range, alternative drive technologies, lightweight construction and connectivity for vehicles.

The BMW Group increased deliveries to customers by 6.4% to 1,963,798 units (2012: 1,845,186 units), with all three brands registering all-time highs.

Record dividend of 2.60 per share of common stock proposed

BMW AG is committed to sharing its success with its shareholders. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2014 that the dividend be increased to a new highest level of  2.60 (2012:  2.50) per share of common stock and  2.62 (2012:  2.52) per share of preferred stock. Based on these figures, the total distribution will rise to  1,707 million (2012:  1,640 million). The dividend rate is unchanged at 32.0% and is within the BMW Group＊s target corridor of 30 to 40%.

Automotive segment revenues rose by 0.6% to  70,629 million (2012:  70,208). Influenced by the above-mentioned factors 每 high expenditure for new technologies, product range expansion and market launch costs as well as increased competition 每 EBIT decreased to  6,657 million (2012:  7,599 million; -12.4%). The EBIT margin came in at 9.4% and was thus in the upper half of the targeted corridor of between 8 and 10%. Segment profit before tax amounted to  6,561 million (2012:  7,170 million; -8.5%).

The BMW brand retained pole position in the premium segment in 2013, with worldwide sales up by 7.5% to 1,655,138 units (2012: 1,540,085 units). The BMW X1 as well as the BMW 3, 5, and 6 Series all asserted their positions as market leaders in their own segments.

Sales of the BMW X5 were only slightly down on the previous year at 107,231 units (2012: 108,544 units; -1.2%) despite the model change (the new BMW X5 has been available since mid-November).

The BMW 3 Series remained a major source of growth in the past year, with sales rising by 23.0% to 500,332 units (2012: 406,752 units).

The increase is due to the growing need for engineers and skilled workers in order to keep pace with continued strong demand on the one hand and to push ahead with innovations and develop new technologies on the other.
