The brand-new 1 coin is coming - and you only have months to spend your old ones.

Its anti-counterfeiting features include its distinctive multi-sided shape and dual-metal design, with a gold-coloured outer ring and a silver-looking centre.

It also boasts a hologram-like image that looks like a  symbol or a 1 when viewed from different angles.

The Mint will release 1.5 billion of the 1 coins, and a new 50p honouring Sir Isaac Newton.

The current 1 coin is being replaced for the first time in over 30 years - because experts reckon its vulnerable to counterfeits.

In recent years, up to as many as three pound coins in every 100 have been found to be fake.

First issued in 1983, one in every thirty 1 coins is now a fake, and these forgeries cost the Government 2million every year.

Get Surrey asked a wide range of food stores from Asda to Sainsbury's what will happen to the trolleys needing 1 inserted when the new coins are introduced.

Here is what they had to say:

Trolleys will be adapted to fit both the new and current 1 coin, and also tokens in the shape of either coin.

An Asda spokesperson even added: "Our customers needn't worry about our trolleys. They will accept both the new 1 coin as well as the current version and trolley tokens."

The new 1 coin will be circulated in March.

Shoppers will have just six months to spend their old one pound coins.

They will stop being legal tender on October 15, 2017.
