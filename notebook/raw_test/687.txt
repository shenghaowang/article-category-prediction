WASHINGTON ¡ª All but one of the nation¡¯s 30 largest banks are better able to withstand a severe U.S. recession and global downturn than at any time since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

The only bank to fail the Fed¡¯s annual ¡°stress test¡± was Zions Bancorp, parent of Vectra Bank Colorado. Vectra Bank is the state¡¯s seventh-largest bank, with deposits of $2.15 billion and an active small-business lender.

Zions, based in Salt Lake City, lacked the minimum level of capital the Fed deemed necessary to withstand a crisis after it booked hefty charges last year related to losses on investment securities and other one-time items. The bank¡¯s director of investor relations was unable to comment before publication.

The Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks every year since 2009, when the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual checkup aims to ensure that banks could keep lending during a severe recession.

Under the Fed¡¯s stress tests¡¯ ¡°severely adverse¡± scenario, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment ¡ª now at 6.7 percent ¡ª would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.

The Fed said that under the crisis scenario, the 30 banks would suffer combined losses on loans of $366 billion through the fourth quarter of 2015. That¡¯s down from projected losses of $462 billion in last year¡¯s tests.

The 30 tested banks included some of Colorado¡¯s largest: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp.

The Fed will announce next week whether it will approve plans by some of the banks to increase dividends or buy their own stock.

Last year, government-owned Ally Financial Inc. was the only bank that failed. In this round, Ally passed.
