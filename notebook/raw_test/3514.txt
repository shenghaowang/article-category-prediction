South Dakota is tied with New Hampshire for the nation¡¯s lowest unemployment rate.

The state¡¯s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 2.7 percent in February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

North Dakota, which was the state with the lowest unemployment, is third at 2.9 percent.

The Sioux Falls unemployment rate was unchanged in February, at 2.8 percent, but that figure is not seasonally adjusted.
