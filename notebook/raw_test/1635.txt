DENVER - Colorado clarified its marijuana packaging requirements Monday, giving medical pot the same rules as pot for recreational pot.

But Gov. John Hickenlooper says it's too soon to consider a new law limiting potency or making other big changes to the marijuana market.

 

The new law requires edible marijuana sold to medical marijuana patients to meet the same packaging standards as pot sold to recreational customers. The packaging must be opaque and childproof.

 

Another new law signed Monday gives allows local governments that want to run criminal background checks on people working in the marijuana industry to submit fingerprints to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Everyone working in the industry already completes state-level background checks.
