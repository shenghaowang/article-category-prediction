McDonalds Canada is doing a soft launch of their new restaurant concept to evolve into a more casual dining experience. Their restaurants have slowly been shifting in the last few years by introducing the McCafe concept. Now, more changes are coming.

In Metro Vancouver, there are currently 3 locations ¨C Langley (20037 84th Ave.), Surrey (8586 120th St.), and Burnaby (7360 Market Crossing) where customers can build their own burger from 30 different options through a touch-screen kiosk and have it delivered to their table.

All these choices are super tough to make if you are indecisive. They have a few pre-built combinations like the Homestyle and Aioli Angus Burger, the Angus True Blue and Guac, as well as the Angus Sriracha The Bold.

At the kiosk, you can order your regular meal, or do the ¡°Create Your Taste¡± option. By the end of 2017, they will have these kiosks rolled out to 1,000 locations across Canada. Currently, other countries like US, UK, and Australia have introduced these kiosks as well.

Right now you can only customize with angus beef patties. There is no option to add fish patties or chicken patties. This is where I got a bit disappointed since I wanted to build something super crazy like the Land Sea Air burger on the ¡®secret menu¡¯, but never wanted to ask staff about it.

After your customize you burger, you can add any sides you want like salad, fries or poutine. I went with the salad since I needed to balance out my 3 patty burger.

The customization starts at $6.99, but the more protein you add to your burger like patties and bacon, the cost will go up. In my case, I added 4 bacon strips and 3 patties¡­.then added a coke, salad and brownie.

After you confirm your order and pay, you are given a tracking number. When your order is ready, the meal will be delivered to your table.

While you¡¯re waiting, the kitchen is busy putting your handcrafted burger together. They start by buttering and toasting your buns. This is their cool butter roller that spreads a thin layer of butter over your bun before it goes for a toasting.

Then all the toppings get stacked on top.

Oh hello there.

Amy the Food Queen was there as well and she created a 2 angus beef patty, with various toppings in between the sesame bun. The fries come in a super cute basket similar to A&W.

On the other hand, I went a tad crazy and built this monster. 3 Angus Beef Patties, 4 strips of crisp bacon and kept the veggies to a minimum.

I went with the sesame buns as well. Pretty good bun compared to the other options.

I probably would only recommend up to 2 patties as 3 was a bit much. Anyways, the bacon at this location was very crispy compared to some other locations.

You can grab your custom burger to go. They have a special boxes for it.

McDonald¡¯s McCafe option has been doing quite well in Canada, so they have expanded their bakery options beyond muffins and cookies to go with morning coffee.

They have a large display for all their pastries.

Overall, it¡¯s a neat idea, but I wish there were a few more customizable options when it comes to the patty.
