MULBERRY CEO Bruno Guillon has resigned with immediate effect. The French businessman, formerly managing director of Herm¨¨s, started in the role two years ago to the month, during which time the label has lost two-thirds of its market value.

Godfrey Davis, the brand's non-executive chairman and previous CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is found. The company is still searching for a creative director, following the departure of Emma Hill in September 2013.

Prior to Guillon's appointment, Mulberry was recognised as one of London's most high-profile brands, resonating with fashion followers, celebrities and professional women. Its bags had widespread appeal, particularly the Alexa satchel - which caused its profits to soar - and its catwalk shows were known for their starry front rows, including Kate Moss, Michelle Williams and Lana Del Rey. Upon joining Mulberry in March 2012, Guillon raised the label's prices and streamlined its famously large-scale parties in a bid to make it a serious luxury contender. Over the past two years, the brand has lost some of its playful, quintessentially British, youthful appeal, with its direction becoming increasingly unclear.

Last season, the brand cancelled its London Fashion Week show and instead staged a presentation in which Cara Delevingne unveiled a collection of self-designed bags - a move that, although it distracted the press, did not negate the company's need to find a new creative director. Names rumoured to be filling the post have included Hannah MacGibbon, Erdem Moralioglu, Roland Mouret, Mary Katrantzou and Sophie Hulme.
