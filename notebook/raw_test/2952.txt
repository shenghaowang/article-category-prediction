DENVER -- Two bills signed into law Monday aim to protect Colorado children from recreational marijuana.

"Keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids should be a priority for all of us," said Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, before signing the bills into law. "Every neuroscientist I've talked to has talked about the possibility this could have long-term effects on a child's brain."

One proposal seeks to reduce the number of accidental ingestions of edible marijuana by young children who, for instance, confuse pot brownies for candy; and it also looks to limit the ability of older children to purchase recreational marijuana using a fake ID.

House Bill 1122, which requires all edible marijuana to be sold in opaque, child-proof packaging and also empowers pot retailers to confiscate suspected fake IDs like liquor store owners can, passed both the House and Senate unanimously.

"We had the marijuana industry, we had the medical profession, we had law enforcement, we had Republicans, we had Democrats all come together to say 'how can we fix these problems?'" said Rep. Daniel Kagan, D-Denver, the bill's House sponsor.

The proposal also specifies that marijuana that is grown in a home with people under 21 must be enclosed and locked.

"We have seen increased visits to the ER and urgent care clinics because kids are accidentally ingesting marijuana," said Sen. Linda Newell, D-Littleton, the senate sponsor.

"This new law goes a long way to ensuring that we¡¯re taking steps to keep kids safe."

The new laws take effect immediately.
