Watch out, GameStop, you have a new competitor in the used game market. Wal-Mart announced today that it will begin accepting video game software trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

During a conference call attended by GameSpot, Wal-Mart merchandising chief Duncan Mac Naughton said Wal-Mart is hoping to ¡°shake up¡± the secondhand market and steal some marketshare away from competitors like GameStop.

Wal-Mart¡¯s ¡°true differentiator,¡± Mac Naughton said, is that you can use your in-store credit for purchases outside of gaming like food and clothing. Indeed, GameStop can¡¯t compete there. But unlike GameStop, Wal-Mart will not have a cash option for trade-ins. It¡¯s credit or nothing. And on top of that, Wal-Mart will only accept games, not hardware.
