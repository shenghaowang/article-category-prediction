The United States is planning to deliver a captured oil tanker to the Libyan government.

A Pentagon spokesman says that 34 sailors from the frigate USS Elrod are aboard the tanker, named the Morning Glory. It will be escorted to international waters just outside Libya's territorial waters where the handoff is expected to take place within a day or two.

U.S. Navy SEAL commandos captured the Morning Glory on Sunday as it anchored off the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. A Libyan militia had been using it to try to export oil in defiance of the country's central government.
