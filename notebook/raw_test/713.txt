Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) today made available the results of the company's 2014 Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test on the Bank of America Investor Relations website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com under Events and Presentations.

Bank of America's estimates assume no changes to the company's current common share dividends (and contractually obligated payments on other regulatory capital instruments) and include the common stock repurchases previously disclosed for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test requirements. These estimates should not be regarded as forecasts of actual financial results for either Bank of America or its selected subsidiaries.

These results are estimates and may not reflect the actual impacts to Bank of America if such a hypothetical scenario were to occur. Importantly, in certain instances, methodologies required by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency differ from Bank of America's internal practices; therefore, the results may not reflect actions that Bank of America would likely employ under such stressed conditions. Investors in securities issued by Bank of America should not rely on the Stress Test results as being indicative of expected future results.
