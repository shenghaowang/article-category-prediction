Democratic Leader released the following statement today on the announcement that 5 million Americans have successfully enrolled in private plans through the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces:

"Today, the Affordable Care Act reached another milestone in the effort to make health care a right, not a privilege, for every American. This announcement is further evidence that this landmark law continues to strengthen the health and economic security of working families and the middle class.

"Surpassing five million enrollments in the insurance marketplaces is about more than a statistic - it is about the ability of millions of people to lead healthier lives. It is about the parents who can now afford to pay the bills for their children's doctor appointments and the workers who no longer face the impossible choice between getting the medical care they need and declaring bankruptcy. It is about the stories of Americans in every community now enjoying the personal and economic freedom secured by this law.

"With five million Americans signed up - and counting - the Affordable Care Act is moving forward. Each new enrollee is a reminder of the real, human cost of each of the 51 Republican votes to repeal or undermine this legislation. It's time for Republicans to abandon their ill-advised assault on the health of the middle class and for us to work together to keep Americans on the road to greater choice, quality, and affordability in their health care."
