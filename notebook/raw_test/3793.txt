RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 5 percent in January.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5.2 percent in December and down from 5.7 percent a year ago.

Officials say January's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January.
