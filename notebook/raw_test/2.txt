Asian equity benchmarks finished mixed Thursday after initially extending this week¡¯s gains a bit further as minutes of the Federal Reserve¡¯s meeting revealed a deeper-than-expected divide on the timing of the next interest rate increase.

The prospect of a slower pace of additional rate increases pressured the dollar in Wednesday afternoon U.S. trading, and the subsequent gain in the yen weighed on Japanese stocks Thursday. The Nikkei NIK, -2.67% finished down 0.1% as the dollar USDJPY, -0.60% lost ground against the yen in Asian trading.

Still, this year¡¯s rebound for the yen doesn¡¯t seen to be hitting Japan¡¯s economy. Exports rose 13% in July from a year ago, the eighth-straight monthly gain, government data showed Thursday. Japanese stocks often fall when the yen strengthens amid fears that a stronger currency will hit exporters ¡ª a key facet of the country¡¯s economy.

Stock gauges elsewhere in Asia showed small gains or loses Thursday, following modest gains in U.S. equities overnight.

While Rob Carnell, head of Asia research at ING, said, ¡°Confusion reigns at the Federal Reserve,¡± he added Asian markets were likely to take comfort in additional rate increases are likely to come ¡°at worst at a very-modest pace.¡±

Australia¡¯s main index XJO, -1.05% gave up 0.1%, while South Korea SEU, -2.57% and New Zealand NZ50GR, -1.47% closed higher by 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, the latter having set record closing highs each of the past two sessions. Meanwhile, helping Korea¡¯s Kospi was a 1.8% rebound in Samsung 005930, -1.15% amid broad early strength for tech stocks in general.

In Taiwan, Pegatron 4938, -5.10% , Foxconn 2354, -4.83% and Catcher 2474, -3.49% rose more than 1% each, while the Taiex index Y9999, -2.00% was up a more-modest 0.8%.

The region¡¯s biggest tech stock, Tencent 0700, -4.60% , jumped to fresh record highs in Hong Kong as its second-quarter results were notably stronger than analysts expected. It closed 1.9% higher. That helped limit losses for the Hang Seng Index HSI, -3.08% , of which the messaging/gaming giant is the biggest component. The gauge closed down 0.2%.

Also strong Thursday were metals-related stocks amid a rebound in prices fueled by the weaker dollar. Rio Tinto RIO, -0.78% and Sumitomo Metal 5713, -2.64% rose 1.4% and 2%, respectively.
