The 800,000-a-year French boss of British luxury handbag maker Mulberry quit today after a troubled two years in charge.

Bruno Guillon¡¯s departure follows a series of profit warnings, a collapse in the share price and the loss of the label¡¯s star designer. Mulberry also cancelled its show at London Fashion Week last month and instead unveiled a new collection from 21-year-old supermodel Cara Delevingne.

Fashion experts said Mr Guillon had paid the price for the failure of his strategy of taking the 43-year-old brand upmarket and ramping up prices.

He joined in March 2012 from French brand Herm¨¨s but under his leadership Mulberry lost City support, with three profit warnings in two years and a 60 per cent slump in the share price.

His decision to charge more alienated some customers. Mulberry¡¯s flagship Alexa satchel, named after Alexa Chung, costs up to 4,500. The brand was also hit by the departure of creative director Emma Hill last June after a reported series of disagreements with her boss. She had been credited with transforming the Somerset-based business into a fashion powerhouse.

Mulberry will now be led by former chief executive Godfrey Davis, who will become executive chairman while a permanent replacement for Mr Guillon is sought. Today Mr Davis said the Frenchman had ¡°enabled the company to increase its international appeal¡±.

But Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: ¡°My conviction is that Mulberry would be much better off making the most of the accessible and mid-price point handbags market.¡±
