The new design for the 12 sided pound coin is to be revealed today ahead of the Budget announcement. The coin was designed by a teenager, from the West Midlands who won a competition to design the new logo on the front of the coin.

Although the new design will be revealed today, it will not be in circulation until 2017, the reasoning for the new design, especially with the introduction of 12 sides, is to prevent the coin from being counterfeited.
