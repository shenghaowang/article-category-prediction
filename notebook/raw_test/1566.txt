The largest retailer in the country will be getting into the used game business soon. Walmart has announced plans to allow trade-ins starting March 26, with pre-owned games hitting shelves later this year. Next week you'll be able to trade your video games to Walmart or Sam's Club locations and use the store credit, while your old games get shipped off to be part of the company's first wave of pre-owned stock.

According to the announcement, games should be presented in their original packaging, and the electronics department will check for damage before giving an estimate. Later this year, they'll be sold back in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition. A calculator is available to estimate trade value.

GameStop's used games business kept the company with solid profits even as the industry itself was suffering from the recession. Walmart chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton seemed to indicate pretty clearly that his company's move into used games is attempting to take a piece of that pie.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," said Mac Naughton. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want. While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games."
