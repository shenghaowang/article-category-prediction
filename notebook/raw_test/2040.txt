Schulman said the company's priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage the company's assets and team to drive the next stage of 's growth.

"The need for protecting and managing your information has never been stronger, and we must act aggressively to capture a growing share of this market," said Brown in the release.

"By concentrating on product innovation and growth initiatives, we aim to leverage 's tremendous assets across both consumer and enterprise applications to enhance our position as a market leader."
