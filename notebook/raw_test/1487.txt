Economic sanctions are having an immediate impact on some Russian banks, with and Mastercard no longer processing transactions by cardholders, a number of Russian banks said.

On Friday, shares of fell 2.44% on the Micex in Moscow, with the nation's biggest lender, down 0.45% on the day, and its subsidiary Sberbank Rossii down 1.3%. Neither of those banks were part of the ban, but investors took it out on the major publicly traded names today, possibly setting the stage for steeper declines on Monday.

The news signaled the first impact on ordinary Russian citizens by a series of Western sanctions against Russia over the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

Washington promised more sanctions following a vote by the Crimean peninsula to join Russia and secede from Ukraine. Russia voted to annex Crimea on Tuesday. Stage one sanctions had been restricted to targeting high-level officials from traveling to and putting money in U.S. bank accounts.

Several banks told RIA Novosti newswire today that their customer cards were being declined for payment and that they had received no advance notification of the changes. Visa confirmed it had blocked cards issued by four Russian banks following sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury on Thursday.

Visa said the list of the banks facing sanctions announced by the US Treasury on Thursday includes Rossiya Bank, SMP Bank, Sobinbank and Investcapitalbank, the latter two being part of Rossiya Bank.

¡°The management of Rossiya Bank understands the difficulties experienced by clients in this situation, and assures them that everything possible is being done to help,¡± Rossiya Bank said in a statement today.

Following Tuesday's decision by the Russian Parliament to annex Crimea, a strategic peninsula that is home to Russia's historic Black Sea Fleet, Brussels announced it was expanding its sanctions on Russian officials blamed for destabilizing Ukraine. Unlike Washington, the E.U. has not yet agreed on economic sanctions, most likely due to its dependent on Russia for cheap natural gas.

The E.U. did expand the number of Russian and Ukrainian officials under sanctions to 33 Friday morning, just hours after the United States added 20 more officials to its own list.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Dmitry Rogozin, one of the men sanctioned by Washington, downplayed the sanctions yesterday.

¡°As far as sanctions are concerned, there is nothing to talk about so far. There are none at the moment. They have been announced, but we have had no chance to look at them, we haven¡¯t seen them, we haven¡¯t felt them yet,¡± Rogozin said.

The Russian Securities fund, which invests in Sberbank Rossii, fell 2.21%, worse than the Micex Financials index which declined by 2.10%. Financials were the worst performer in Moscow today and are down 23% year-to-date.

Russia has opposed Ukraine¡¯s pro-Western government which took office last month following the ouster of pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. The imbroglio was centered first on Yanukovych's decision to reject an E.U. trade deal in favor of moving the country closer to Russia. In return, he got a nearly 45% reduction on gas prices from oil major Gazprom. But protesters quickly took to the streets and called for Yanukovych's ouster, saying he was operating on behalf of a foreign government. When Washington's chosen man Arseniy Yatsenyuk took over the country, one of his first orders of business was to ax Russia as one of the official languages in Ukraine.

Ethnic Russians, which dominate the Crimean peninsula, took offense. The autonomous region's government voted on a referendum to secede from Ukraine. It won with near unanimity on Sunday, March. 16. Since Yatsenyuk took office on Feb. 23, Washington has been thrust in the middle of a fight that was once between Kiev and Moscow, with Brussels as the third party in the middle.

Both Washington and Brussels have currently slapped Russian politicians with asset freezes and travel bans. All seven members of the G8 group have put preparations on hold for an upcoming summit Sochi, scheduled for June.

On Thursday, Russia returned the favor and banned from Russia deputy national security advisers Ben Rhodes and Caroline Atkinson, senators John McCain, Harry Reid, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

Despite the unfolding crisis, analysts and money managers from Schroders, a U.K. investment firm with over $400 billion in assets under management, said Russia was one of their favorite emerging markets.

"The Ukraine crisis still keeps us up at night," says Nico Marais, head of multi-asset investments at Schroders, said during an investors conference in New York on Wednesday.

Russia's cheap stocks, priced below historic norms, is what makes it a good buy for emerging market value. Sberbank has a price to earnings ratio of under five times.

Investors still smell a value trap as long as sanctions remain a threat.

On Friday, the Market Vectors Russia (RSX) exchange traded fund settled 0.95% higher. The ETF managed to rise 2.25% this week, outperforming gold, the S&P 500 and the MSCI Emerging Markets. RSX is coming off a low base, however, and is down 22.76% year-to-date, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.

Year-to-date performance as of March 21. Based on weightings of MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
