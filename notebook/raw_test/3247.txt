Bentonville ¨C Walmart is getting in on a business that impacts more than 110 million gamers across the country.

Starting Wednesday (March 26), customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value towards purchases of anything sold at Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club, both in stores and online, according to a news release Tuesday.

The games will be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase at a lower price, according to the news release.

¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡± said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S.

¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They¡¯ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,¡± Naughton said.

Here is how it works:
 Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.
 Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.
 The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.
 The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam¡¯s Club, or online.

Later this year, customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and online. They will be labeled ¡°Certified Pre-Owned.¡±
