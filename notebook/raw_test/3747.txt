MUNICH¡ªGerman luxury car maker BMW AG forecast its pretax profit could rise 10% this year, sending its shares soaring to record levels, even as it cautioned the crisis in Crimea could disrupt its outlook.

The world's leading maker of luxury cars based its bullish outlook on a combination of strong demand for 16 new models coming in 2014, a gradual recovery in European car markets, and declining investment in new technology and plants.
