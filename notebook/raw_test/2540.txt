What makes an ethical company? Is it a rigorous code of conduct? Extensive employee education? Implementing security and data stewardship programs? Having a strong mission and values that all employees not only believe in, but live?

The Ethisphere institute recently held their annual World¡¯s Most Ethical Company Gala, where they honored companies that demonstrate leadership in ethical business practices. This year, Premier was recognized for the 10th consecutive year, making it one of only eight companies to have reached this milestone.

To Premier, an ethical company is more than just the rigorous code of conduct we follow, it¡¯s something that affects our members, suppliers, the communities we serve and each other. Our employees are dedicated to improving the health of communities. We are passionate about we do.

Premier employees live the following core values to align integrity and respect with innovation.
 Focus on People: Demonstrating respect for all, and a mutual commitment to the success of the alliance, our employees, our business partners and the communities we serve.
 Integrity: Integrity of the individual, the enterprise and the alliance.
 Passion for Performance: A passion for performance and a bias for action, creating real value for all stakeholders and leading the pace.

These values have helped shape a culture of ethics that empowers Premier employees with a shared vision and strong workforce relationships, which support their efforts in finding ways to improve healthcare and create lasting value.

As a founding member of the Healthcare Group Purchasing Industry Initiative with one of the strongest group purchasing codes of conduct in the industry, Premier continues to raise industry standards.

Together, all of these factors help create an ethical company that continues to support its members and employees. So, join me in congratulating Premier on this amazing milestone, a decade in ethical business practices!
