New universal symbol required for all marijuana packaging and products; Packaging that appeals to children prohibited

DENVER ¨C Effective Oct. 1, Colorado will implement new rules regarding medical and retail marijuana products. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Department of Revenue¡¯s Marijuana Enforcement Division are working together to educate Coloradans about the rules, designed to promote public health and safety, raise awareness and help people more accurately identify marijuana products.
 None All new medical and retail marijuana packaging must feature the new universal symbol on the front. Medical and retail marijuana will have similar, but different symbols. Examples of the symbols can be found here and below. Packaging must include the following statement directly below the symbol: ¡°Contains Marijuana. Keep out of the reach of children.¡±
 None Marijuana infused product manufacturers must comply with the new universal symbol rules by Oct. 1. By Dec. 1, retail stores and medical centers may only sell marijuana marked with the universal symbol.
 
 None Every single standardized serving (a serving consists of 10 mg of THC) of an edible retail marijuana product must be individually marked, stamped or imprinted with the new universal symbol.
 None When impractical to mark an edible retail marijuana product with the universal symbol, as in the case of bulk goods and powders, these products must be packaged in a single serving, child-resistant container.
 None In an edible retail marijuana product that contains multiple servings, each single standardized serving must be marked, stamped or imprinted with the universal symbol.
 
 None Edible medical marijuana infused products must be marked, stamped or imprinted with the universal symbol.
 None Medical marijuana infused product manufacturers may choose to determine standard portions. Each portion must be marked, stamped or imprinted with the universal symbol.

Other important marijuana packaging rules going into effect Oct. 1:
 None The words ¡°candy¡± or ¡°candies¡± cannot appear on marijuana or marijuana packaging, unless part of the marijuana establishment¡¯s name.
 None Each container of medical and retail marijuana must be labeled with necessary and relevant information for consumers, including a potency statement and a contaminant testing statement. The information must be easily accessible to consumers, clear and noticeable. Health and physical benefit claims cannot be included on labels.

¡°Our priority is protecting the public health and safety of all Coloradans,¡± said Barbara Brohl, executive director of the Colorado Department of Revenue. ¡°We collaborated extensively with all stakeholders to develop sensible rules that will provide consumers more information about what they¡¯re buying and to ensure marijuana stays out of the hands of children. It is critical for retail and medical marijuana businesses licensed by the Department of Revenue to understand their role in implementing these new rules on time.¡±

The new universal symbol is a visual indicator that a product contains marijuana. The symbol will help both consumers and non-consumers easily identify marijuana products, understand what a standard serving size is and avoid unintentional ingestion. Equally important, these rules will allow parents, school officials and other authorities to identify marijuana products even when not in packaging.

¡°With the new universal symbol, people can more easily identify marijuana products, monitor their intake by serving size and avoid eating too much,¡± said Dr. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. ¡°And by making marijuana labels less appealing to children, we hope to keep them from accidentally eating THC and suffering the consequences.¡±
