ANKARA - Turkish authorities were seeking to tighten a clampdown on Twitter on Saturday after social media users easily evaded the government's attempt to block access to the service, where links to wiretapped recordings suggesting corruption have been posted, causing

the government major embarrassment before local elections on March 30.

Turkey's state-run news agency, Anadolu, said Twitter had begun on Saturday to close down accounts which the Turkish government has been complaining about, but the report couldn't immediately be verified.

News reports and users said the clampdown was expanded to Google's Domain Name System on Saturday, which had provided many of Twitters millions of Turkish users an alternative means of gaining entry. Still, Turkish users seemed to come out ahead in the cat-and-mouse game, working around that ban too. (AP)
