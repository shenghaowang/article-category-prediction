So, I had a pretty bad flight when I was young (about 11-12) cabin pressure dropped had to do a bit of a dive etc during an thunder storm... since then I have been pretty scared of flying. Although I didn't fly after that flight for several years I have flown for the past 6 years at least once a year for a holiday (usually with the aid of medicine from a doctor).

Recently me and the girlfriend have been looking at going to Mexico (the longest flight I will have ever gone on - with the closest at 5hr 45 mins). We were looking at booking Mexico Glasgow - Cancun in May. The only flights that are available are on the 787 dreamliner.

There has been a lot of reports on the news about this and that going wrong. But is this something to be worried about? Do other planes get just as many issues? etc? Has anyone flown on the 787?

I know air plane accidents are really rare (And even in most cases 95% of people survive as a plane rarely goes smashing into a mountain or drops out the sky. It usually has to do a crash landing or whatever).

But yeah what are your thoughts?
