ySTANBUL (CyHAN)- After popular social media network Twitter was banned late on Thursday by Turkish authorities, international human rights watchdogs and press organizations rushed to express their concerns about the ban, saying it limits freedoms in the country and should be lifted immediately.Earlier on Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoy-an had threatened to "root out" the network, whose users have been posting leaked voice recordings implicating Erdoy-an and members of his inner circle in corruption for months."This is another fundamental blow to freedom of expression in Turkey and the right to access information," said Human Rights Watch (HRW) in a statement released on Friday, adding that "the closure order should be immediately lifted."HRW voiced concerns about human rights and Turkish democracy. "The move further signals that the Turkish government has taken an anti-democratic turn which significantly sets back its human rights record," it said.During a rally ahead of local elections on Thursday, Erdoy-an said: "Twitter, schmitter! We will wipe out all of these [social networks]." A few hours later, when Twitter users in Turkey tried to access the social network's website, they found only a statement, apparently from Turkey's Telecommunications Directorate (TyB), citing four court orders as the basis for blocking the site.Erdoy-an's move has been widely perceived as an attempt to restrict the circulation of wiretapped recordings of high-level officials and their aides on the Internet. Most of the leaks have been posted by two anonymous accounts, @haramzadeler333 and @bascalan.HRW said that limiting freedom of speech by banning Twitter is not a wise way to stifle allegations against government officials. "Conspiracy or not, limiting freedom of speech is no way for the Turkish government to tackle a political crisis," HRW said.The Twitter ban, while sudden, was not entirely unexpected. In early March, Erdoy-an hinted that his government would consider shutting down Facebook and YouTube after the March 30 local elections to avert what he called the negative effects of the Internet on society.In a written statement released on Friday, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatovic called for the ban to be lifted immediately, saying: "Blocking Twitter and threatening to close social media websites only adds to the many concerns about media freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey."She said the Turkish government should "protect and encourage pluralistic discourse both offline and online, instead of stifling it" and called on "the authorities to vacate the court decisions that allow blocking Twitter and restore free public discourse online."The OSCE representative said restrictions on social media only cause "the weakening of freedom of expression, an indispensable element of democracies," and underlined the need for "fundamental reform of laws that allow for the silencing of critical voices in Turkey, among them the Internet Law ..."Shortly after Erdoy-an said that he would eradicate Twitter, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists released a brief statement on its website expressing concern about the prime minister's remarks."We call on Prime Minister Erdoy-an to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections," CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova said on Thursday."Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society," she said.International organizations also took to Twitter to slam the ban. PEN International said Turkey's Twitter block is yet "another front to freedom of expression," and Amnesty International's Turkey office called the move an "unwarranted and unacceptable attack on freedom of expression."(Cihan/Today's Zaman) CyHANCopyright 2014 Cihan News Agency.
