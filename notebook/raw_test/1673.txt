In Paris the CAC 40 climbed 0.46pc to 4,327.91 points, while the Dax 30 in Frankfurt added 0.21pc to 9,296.12 points.

16.27 Ahead of European markets closing, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, takes a look at trading today.

UK and European markets spent most of the day bogged down in US interest rate concerns only to follow US markets higher after the Philadelphia Fed Index came in at 9 months highs with a sign that US business sentiment is improving.

The FTSE dipped briefly below the March 14 low at 6500 before recovering almost all the sessions¡¯ losses tracking US markets higher after the positive Philly Fed and conference board data.

The Dax has been showing relative strength over the FTSE this week since tensions eased in Ukraine with a small decline yesterday and subsequent bigger percentage bounce today.

15.50 US stocks fell sharply during Janet Yellen's testimony yesterday, but are rebounding this afternoon.
 The Dow Jones is up 0.37pc at 16,282
 The S&P 500 is 0.29pc up at 1,866
 The Nasdaq is 0.16pc higher at 4,315

Breaking: Fitch says UK upgrade to AAA rating 'unlikely in the near term'

15.25 The UK's gold-plated credit rating isn't returning any time soon, according to Fitch

The agency says that although the economy is improving, "the UK's fiscal challenge remains large relative to most high-grade sovereigns". It adds that most of the remaining deficit reduction will be left to the next parliament, "making it somewhat less certain".

14.30 Here's the bombshell graph from that IFS report - the Government's change to pension rules, allowing people to withdraw their pots instead of buying annuities, will increase borrowing in the long term rather than lowering it, as the Office for Budget Responsibility said it would yesterday.

This is because there is only a short term boost from a rush of pensioners taking their money out, which is taxable.

14.15 The IFS presentations are out (you can find them here)

A couple of slides of note: Firstly, the think tank using smileys to assess whether policy announcements add up:

Secondly, the number of taxpayers that will be dragged into paying the higher rate will climb above 5m soon:

13.45 More problems being raised by the IFS

<noframe>Twitter: jeremy warner - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23IFS" target="_blank">#IFS</a> Still very little sense of how the major spending cuts still to come are going to be done, says `Paul `Johnson</noframe>

<noframe>Twitter: Hugh Pym - IFS briefing - Treasury getting into bad habits - eg permanent giveaways financed by temporary raisers, spending cuts with no extra money</noframe>

13.30 The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the think thank, has raised questions over the OBR's sums around how much income the Treasury will receive from liberalising pensions.

The IFS's Paul Johnson said the expected higher income from pensioners drawing down taxable lump sums depend "on highly uncertain behavioural assumptions about when people take the money".

He added that allowing pensioners to access their entire pot would be potentially risky, and that those aged 60-65 tend to underestimate their own life expectancy.

New US unemployment claims rise, but point to stable jobs market

13.00 320,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, according to the US Labor Department.

This was up from 315,000 the previous week, but suggests underlying strength in the jobs market, according to economists.

The four-week mobing average, deemed a more reliable indicator, fell to 327,000, the lowest level since November.

12.25 A City trader has been fined 662,700 for driving the value of a government bond higher with the intention of selling it to the Bank of England as part of its quantitative easing scheme.

The Financial Conduct Authority has handed the fine to Mark Stevenson, a bond trader with over 30 years experience.

The FCA says that on October 5 2011 he deliberately raised the price of the gilt by buying into it, in the knowledge that the Bank of England would be buying bonds later that day.

Stevenson's abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and, ultimately, for UK tax payers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions.

Odds almost even on Mulberry takeover

12.00 Mulberry's CEO Bruno Guillion is out the door this morning, and somewhat insultingly, the market likes it - shares are up 2pc as of midday.

Paddy Power has put together the odds on the company's future, and is offering 11/10 on the company being taken over by the end of the year.

Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) and Kering are Paddy Power's favourites to dip into their pockets and buy Mulberry, both at 3/1.

11.20 With Help to Buy now due to continue until the election after next, the housing revival looks set to continue for some time. Today's figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show a 43.1pc rise in the value of mortgage lending between February 2013 and February 2014.

February lending of 15.2bn was the best February performance since 2008. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the data highlights the need for policymakers to keep an eye on prices:

Once strong upward momentum has developed in the housing market, it can be hard to stop ¨C especially if interest rates are unlikely to rise markedly.

We expect house prices to increase by around 8% in 2014 with gains across the country. Furthermore, there is a genuine possibility that this could prove to be a conservative forecast particularly if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is increasingly supported by the ¡°Help to Buy¡± mortgage guarantee scheme.

10.50 The stock market remains weak, with the FTSE 100 now down 1.2pc, or some 78 points, at 6,494 after the Fed last night sparked fears about sooner-than-expected interest rate rises. Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at spread-betting firm IG, said:

Sometimes all it comes down to is a single sentence. Janet Yellen will be pondering over her performance last night, after she spooked markets with talk of an earlier-than-expected rise in US interest rates.

Although the Fed¡¯s statement implied there would be a ¡®considerable¡¯ gap between the end of QE and the first rate hike, Yellen¡¯s definition of considerable as ¡®around six months¡¯ wasn¡¯t as long as some had hoped.

10.25 The Chancellor is in his usual post-Budget attire of hard hart and high-visibility jacket this morning, visiting a building site in Nuneaton.

Barratt Homes, Mr Osborne's hosts today, have announced they are creating 3,000 new jobs after the Government extended Help to Buy to the end of the decade.

10.00 The EU banking commissioner Michel Barnier says the agreement on banking union was reached at 7am this morning after 16 hours of negotiations.

Today's compromise allows us to complete the architecture of the banking union for the eurozone. This would not have been possible without the assiduous work and spirit of compromise demonstrated by both co-legislators

He said that banking union will create financial stability and mean banks will not require huge bailouts funded by taxpayers any more.

Together with the reforms to the financial sector for all 28 countries, the completed banking union will put an end to the era of massive bailouts. It will further contribute to the return to financial stability thus creating the right conditions for the financial sector to once again lend to the real economy which is essential to consolidate the economic recovery and to create jobs.

William Hill: Budget will cost us more than we thought

09.45 One big loser from yesterday's Budget was a triple tax whammy on bookmakers, including a higher 25pc tax rate on controversial fixed odds betting terminals.

Yesterday, William Hill said the increase would cost it 16m, but it has revised this today, saying it will be 22m.

Shares in William Hill are down 2.7pc while Ladbrokes has fallen 4pc.

09.20 The European parliament says it has reached a deal on banking union in the eurozone to create a new agency that will monitor the health of banks in the single currency.

According to Reuters, a fund for the union will be built up out of bank levies over eight years.

Banking union will be a new regulatory system designed to prevent failing banks from throwing economies into crisis.

09.00 The FTSE 100 is now down 44 points, or 0.7pc, at 6,528 as investors take fright at the prospect of interest rate hikes in the US. Gerard Lane, economist at Shore Capital, said:

The Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in the post-FOMC conference gave a shock to investors by suggesting that the gap between the end of QE tapering, scheduled at the end of October, and the first interest rate rise could be ¡®around six months¡¯. Given the market expectations were towards the end of 2015, for markets to consider an interest rate rise in the April 2015 resulted in sharply higher bond yields.

08.50 The prospect of a US interest rate rise next year has sent the pound falling against the greenback.

With investors buying dollars, the pound is worth a cent less than it was yesterday: Here's the action over the last two days:

Osborne: More difficult decisions will be required

08.30 George Osborne has been on Radio 4 speaking about yesterday's Budget. He says policies to reduce energy bills for businesses are an attempt to put the UK on a level playing field with the rest of Europe:

We thought the European carbon trading scheme would work better than it did. The hard fact is that British businesses were going to be unable to compete with those on the continent. It will help many manufacturers who arent particularly energy intensive but do have high energy bills. We want to stay competitive create an economy where companies such as Hitachi choose to come to Britain.

More difficult decisions are required but I think we've shown we're capable of doing that. Public services have improved crime is down, we've protected the NHS budget so we've proved we've got the right approach to this. The big picture is we've got a long term economic plan that is working and brining economic security to Britain.

We don't manufacture enough, we don't export a lot, we don't save enough, we don't invest a lot and that's what future budgets are going to be about.

<noframe>Twitter: BBC Radio 4 Today - Chancellor: "I&rsquo;m not pretending to be a miracle worker, but changes to pensions and savings all contribute to creating a different culture"</noframe>
 The Japanese electronics company Hitachi will move its rail business from Tokyo London, in a move to expand in Europe and the UK including on projects such as HS2. The transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin calls the move "an incredible vote of confidence in a growing Britain".
 The chief executive of fashion brand Mulberry says he is stepping down with immediate effect, without giving a reason. Bruno Guillon will be replaced by chairman and former chief executive Godfrey Davis.
 And annual profits at Next have overtaken those at M&S for the first time. Profits have risen from 667m to 695m - ahead of what Marks is expected to report.

08.00 The FTSE 100 has followed Asia down. It's trading at around 6,540 this morning - 32 points or 0.5pc off

Stocks fall after Yellen says rates could rise next year

07.30 You may have missed it with everything else going on, but the Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen dropped a bombshell last night, suggesting that interest rates in the US could be rising as soon as 12 months from now.

The US central bank continued to slow its bond buying programme by $10bn a month to $55bn from next month, and said it could stop purchases completely in the autumn. Yellen added that the Fed could start to rise six months after that. Our US Business Editor Katherine Rushton has more here.

This morning, the dollar has spiked, US bond yields have risen, and markets in Asia and Australia have fallen.
 The Nikkei has closed down 1.65pc
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.1pc

The FTSE 100 is expected to open up to 1pc down this morning.

The Chancellor has batted away suggestions that scrapping the requirement to buy annuities is irresponsible. He told BBC News

People who have saved for their lives, these are responsible people capable of making good decision with good advice about their future

For many people annuities haven¡¯t been good value they haven¡¯t provided good incomes of what they¡¯d hoped

Consumer groups would not be welcoming this if they didn¡¯t feel it was a step in a positive direction
