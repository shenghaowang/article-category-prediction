The new coin has a twelve-sided shape, similar to the pre-decimalisation three-pence piece.

The Royal Mint said the coin would be made from two different coloured metals, and contain an iSIS (Integrated Secure Identification Systems) feature ¨C a new high security coinage currency system developed by The Royal Mint.

In a statement, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said: ¡°After thirty years¡¯ loyal service, the time is right to retire the current 1 coin, and replace it with the most secure coin in the world.

¡°With advances in technology making high-value coins like the 1 ever more vulnerable to counterfeiters, it¡¯s vital that we keep several paces ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency.

¡°I am particularly pleased that the coin will take a giant leap into the future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time, paying tribute to past in the 12-sided design of the iconic threpenny bit.¡±
