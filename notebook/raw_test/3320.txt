BENTONVILLE, Arkansas -- Video game fans who are growing tired of their current collections will soon have another option for getting rid of them¡­and picking up some new titles from other gamers with the same idea.

Wal-Mart will soon be joining the likes of GameStop, Best Buy, Target and other retailers in dealing with used video games, the retail giant announced Tuesday. Starting on March 26, customers may trade in their old games for in-store and online credit at Wal-Mart and Sam¡¯s Club.

The traded games will be refurbished then sold as ¡°Certified Pre-Owned¡± games at discounted prices in Wal-Mart¡¯s approximately 3,100 U.S. stores later this year.

¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡± said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S. ¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They¡¯ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.¡±
