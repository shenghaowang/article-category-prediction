COPPER futures have closed sharply lower on the London Metal Exchange (LME), after crashing to seven-and-a-half-month lows amid renewed concerns over Chinese economic growth.

The LME's flagship three-month copper contract was down 3.8 per cent at $US6,781 a metric ton at the PM kerb close on Friday, its lowest price since July 31.

Chinese solar-equipment maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co became the first Chinese company to default on a bond traded in the mainland on Friday, rattling investor confidence. The default comes amid broader fears about the impact of slowing Chinese economic growth on demand for base metals, which are used in everything from smartphones to household plumbing. China is the world's top metals consumer, accounting for about 40 per cent of global copper demand.

"Metals were rocked by the Chinese corporate default," said Michael Turek, director of metals trading with futures brokerage Newedge.

"This underscores not only the systemic structural debt issue there but also the Chinese central government's apparent willingness to forgo short-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth to skim speculative excesses for longer-term benefit."

While copper's deep descent could attract some opportunistic buying at lower levels "it will take some really positive Chinese news to lift copper back from the doldrums," said Chris Beauchamp a market analyst at IG.

On Monday, HSBC said its widely tracked manufacturing index for China fell to a seven-month low in February. A similar government index, released Saturday, also fell.
