Stocks were indicated marginally higher on Friday, but the S&P 500 had an all-time high close on Thursday. Investors have proven over and over that they want to buy stocks on weakness, and they have bought literally every single pullback for almost four years now. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new trading and investment ideas. Some analyst calls cover stocks to buy, and some cover stocks to sell or to avoid.

These are Friday¡¯s top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) saw its iPhone 6 sales targets raised handily at UBS late Thursday.

While this call was cited late in the day, most of Apple¡¯s gains may have been tied to the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high close.
