The average number of mortgage applications slid 2.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis as interest rates grew from the prior week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.

Applications volume has dropped in three of the past four weeks according to MBA, as interest rates have generally ticked higher. That trend is a reversal from the beginning of the year, when lower interest rates led to modest growth in application volume.

On an unadjusted basis, the MBA said the market composite slipped 1% from a week earlier. The refinance index dropped 3%, while the seasonally adjusted purchase index fell 1%.

The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loans grew to 4.52% from 4.47% the previous week. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo-loan balances increased to 4.41% from 4.37%.

The average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration climbed to 4.18% from 4.13% the prior week.

The average rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 3.53% from 3.52%. The 5/1 ARM average increased to 3.18% from 3.09%.
