General Motors Co. now says it may have known about problems with its ignition switches dating back to 2001 when it was developing but had not yet launched the Saturn Ion.

In documents disclosed to federal regulators, GM said it had found some sort of issue contributing to the ignition's inner workings which have now been linked to a recall of 1.6 million vehicles and 12 deaths.

The auto maker said an ignition switch design change had resolved the problem. However, a service technician at an unnamed dealership observed the Ion stall while driving. In a report, it was noted that the owner "had several keys on the key ring" and that the additional weight of the keys had "worn out the ignition switch."

The service technician replaced the switch and the report was closed. GM went on to say there were other reports of complaints from customers not able to start their Ion engines. The auto maker declined to offer details.

GM disclosed the findings in its updated chronology of events that led to the February recall of millions of vehicles submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday. NHTSA posted the information on its website Wednesday.

Originally, the first reports of ignition switch problems and stalling centered around the launch of the Chevrolet Cobalt in 2004.

The component at the heart of the recall costs a few dollars to make and minutes to install, according to its manufacturer, auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive PLC, which could provoke more questions about why the problem wasn't fixed years ago.

Delphi told Wall Street analysts this week it expects to spend between $2 to $5 to produce a replacement ignition switch that can then be "swapped out" in a matter of minutes by mechanics at GM dealerships. The figure was reported in a research note written by JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, who was among a group of analysts who met with Delphi leaders.

Delphi, which manufactured the original switch, corroborated the report but offered no additional comment.

The figure suggests GM may spend about $8 million on replacement switches, while also keeping dealership labor costs in check.

GM faces multiple investigations--including a federal criminal probe--aimed at determining why the auto maker didn't act sooner to fix the faulty ignition switches.

"We have to get to the bottom of this," said Sen. Claire McCaskill, (D.-Mo.), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer protection, who said she would hold a hearing in April concerning the GM recall. "We need to find out who dropped the ball and put millions of Americans at risk."

GM has said its employees learned of an incident in 2004 in which a Cobalt lost engine power after the ignition key was jarred out of the "on" position, disabling the car's air bags. The car was about to be launched at the time. GM employees replicated the problem in test drives, according to documents submitted to safety regulators by GM.

An engineering inquiry was opened but later closed "after consideration of the lead time required, cost and effectiveness' of the solution offered by GM engineers," according to GM.

It wouldn't be until sometime during the 2007 model year of the Chevrolet Cobalt that the ignition switch was redesigned. But GM didn't recall the Cobalts or other cars with similar ignition locks until last month.

The problem occurred when drivers would turn the key from the "off" position, through the "accessory" position to the "on" position. However, the switch's detent plunger and spring inside allowed the ignition switch to turn back to the "accessory" position when the key was either bumped or there was too much weight hanging from the key's head.

GM declined to comment on the timeline and the switch issue beyond the documentation it has already submitted to the NHTSA.

Separately, GM said Wednesday it has authorized U.S. dealers to give any owner of a car covered in the recall, and unhappy with the vehicle, a $500 cash allowance to buy or lease a new GM product. The allowance is available through April 30 and can be used on a new 2013, 2014 or 2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac.

"In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special, $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle," spokesman Greg Martin said. "We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM, nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance."

The issue of the cost of the ignition switches and the delays in replacing them will likely be just one facet of the investigations under way. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has begun looking into the auto maker's handling of complaints about faulty ignition switches. The probe is at a preliminary stage. The House Energy and Commerce Committee also said it would investigate the case and hold hearings.

The auto maker is also facing an April 3 deadline in answering 107 questions posed by NHTSA concerning GM's timeline on the events leading to the recall. NHTSA is trying to decide if GM was noncompliant in the time it took to initiate the recall.

Meanwhile, owners of the vehicles can't get their cars repaired until April, when GM plans to begin repairing switches in 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, the 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and the 2007 Saturn Sky.

GM is taking steps to reassure consumers and regulators that it now is committed to addressing the problem. The auto maker earlier this week said Chicago attorney Anton Valukas, who served as the examiner of the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., will help lead an internal probe of the handling of the ignition-switch recall.

Morningstar Inc. senior equity analyst David Whiston, along with JP Morgan's Mr. Brinkman, said the company is likely to shake off any short-term market-share loss.

"The company may well lose sales in the short run because of constant negative headlines, but the impact to its reputation depends on how Chief Executive Mary Barra and her team respond over the next few months, " Mr. Whiston said in a research note. "We expect GM will continue to take responsibility and admit fault in how it handled the process."

The not-for-profit Center for Auto Safety on Wednesday called on GM to establish a $1 billion victims fund and asked the auto maker to waive immunity it received under its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring from most lawsuits.
