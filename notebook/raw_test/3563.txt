Virginia¡¯s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined in January to its lowest point since November 2008, the Virginia Employment Commission reported Monday.

The state¡¯s jobless rate stood at 5 percent in January, down from 5.2 percent in December.

Virginia¡¯s jobless rate had dropped for six consecutive months by January, falling to its lowest level since it stood at 4.9 percent in November 2008.

The state rate also remained well below the January national rate of 6.6 percent, which was down one-tenth of a percentage point from December.

Although the jobless rate declined, the two surveys that the federal government conducts of households and employers to determine the unemployment rate showed a mixed picture for the labor market.

The household survey showed positive trends, with the number of unemployed people in Virginia declining by 5,195 and the overall workforce growing by 13,946 in January after contracting the previous seven months. A growing workforce is often a sign that jobless people are more confident about finding work.

However, a survey of employers showed a decline in nonfarm payrolls by about 9,500 jobs in January to a total of 3,758,900, the second consecutive monthly decrease. December¡¯s payroll figures also were adjusted downward to a loss of 800 jobs instead of the initially reported increase of 3,100 jobs.

¡°The winter weather may have added some noise to this data,¡± said Ann Lang, senior economist for the commission. She said the 9,500 decline in payroll employment was not statistically significant.

Virginia¡¯s nonfarm payroll employment still has not recovered to its prerecession peak of 3,791,900 in April 2008.

Virginia had the 13th-lowest rate among U.S. states in January, and it was among 43 states where the unemployment rate fell, the U.S. Labor Department said Monday.

The unemployment rate rose in just one state ¡ª Iowa ¡ª where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Rates were unchanged in six states.

The numbers indicate that the steady decline in the unemployment rate nationwide has been broad-based, occurring throughout much of the country. The overall U.S. unemployment rate has fallen 1 percentage point in the past 12 months.

Twenty-three states reported more hiring in January, while 27, including Virginia, said that the number of jobs fell.

Harsh winter weather weighed on hiring nationwide, with employers adding just 129,000 jobs in January. That¡¯s below the average monthly gain of about 180,000 in the previous two years.
