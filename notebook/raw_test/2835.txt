Pandora One to Increase in Price

Over the last five years, Pandora One has been able to keep its cost steady, charging subscribers of the service $3.99 per month. As content costs have gone upwards however, with Pandora claiming that the royalty rates it pays performers via SoundExchange have increased 53 percent in the last five years, Pandora has announced that its subscription model is undergoing some changes. The main focal point of these changes is that Pandora One will go up in price, costing listeners $4.99 per month, or $1 more per month. The change is not set to take effect until May of this year, and customers can even lock in the current price on a new loyalty program if they subscribe before the change is implemented.

It is worth noting that the annual subscription option for Pandora One is ending, forcing subscribers of the service to pay monthly. The advertisement laden version of Pandora will still be available for free for listeners who chose to not subscribe to Pandora One.
