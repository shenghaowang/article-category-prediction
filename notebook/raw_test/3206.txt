Kingsport, TENN., March 20, 2014 - Eastman Chemical Company EMN, -0.99% announced today that it has been recognized by the Ethisphere(R) Institute as a 2014 World's Most Ethical Company(R) for its efforts to continually raise the bar on ethical leadership and corporate behavior.

"Eastman is dedicated to conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest legal and ethical standards," stated David Golden, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary for Eastman. "For nearly 100 years, business ethics have been top priority for Eastman. Ethics are critical to success because they build trust and confidence in our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we work and live. Receiving this prestigious recognition further reinforces the commitment to honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior inherent in the Eastman culture."

Eastman has a number of policies and initiatives in place that allow its team members to cultivate a culture of the highest integrity and ethical standards. The company has an Office of Global Business Conduct, led by Eastman's Chief Legal Officer, which establishes the Code of Business Conduct. Globally, dedicated Eastman professionals are employed to support the company and its partners in doing business in the most ethical and compliant manner. The Code of Business Conduct outlines the laws, principles and guidelines all employees follow regarding honesty, integrity and responsible corporate behavior.

The company also has a third party Code of Conduct, called 'Doing Business with Eastman', which outlines the high ethical standards that Eastman expects of its business partners. Annual training on the Code of Business Conduct is required for all employees. Additionally, the 24-hour available Business Conduct Helpline provides an anonymous means for employees and business partners to report suspected violations.

World's Most Ethical Company honorees understand the correlation between ethics, reputation and daily interactions with their brand and that the award belongs as much to their associates as it does to them. Eastman is one of only three companies in the global chemical industry honored this year.

"The entire community of World's Most Ethical Companies believe that customers, employees, investors and regulators place a high premium on trust and that ethics and good governance are key in earning it," said Ethisphere's Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Erblich. "Eastman joins an exclusive community committed to driving performance through leading business practices. We congratulate everyone at Eastman for this extraordinary achievement."

The World's Most Ethical Company assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient(TM) framework. The Ethics Quotient framework has been developed over years of effort to provide a means to assess an organization's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The information collected provides a comprehensive sampling of definitive criteria of core competencies, rather than all aspects of corporate governance, risk, sustainability, compliance and ethics. The Ethics Quotient framework and methodology was determined, vetted and refined by the expert advice and insights gleaned from Ethisphere's network of thought leaders and from the World's Most Ethical Company Methodology Advisory Panel.

Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (25%), reputation, leadership and innovation (20%), governance (10%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (25%) and culture of ethics (20%).
