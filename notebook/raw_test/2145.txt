Video game retailer GameStop now has some competition for the largest retailer out there. Wal-Mart announced yesterday that it will begin accepting video game trade-ins at 3,100 stores nationwide on March 26.

Wal-Mart says it wants to ¡°shake up¡± the secondhand market and steal some of the increasingly dwindling market-share from competitors like GameStop.

So why trade games in at Wally-World as opposed to GameStop or Best Buy? Wal-Mart executive Mac Naughton says that traded-in games will get in-store credit that can be used on anything in the store. Including, but not limited to, bags of chips, fly threads and boogie boards, as an example.

Mr. Naughton went on to explain that the other big difference between Wal-Mart and other trade-in opportunities is that the store will ¡°pay more than anybody else¡± for old games. While prices vary he said the average price paid per title should be around $35.
 Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.
 Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.
 The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.
 The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam¡¯s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com
