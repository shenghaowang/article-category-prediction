Poor visibility has hampered search efforts for debris that could be related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean, following new Chinese satellite images of a large object and separate sightings from a search plane of scattered debris.

On Saturday images taken on 18 March by a Chinese satellite were released, appearing to show an object measuring 22 metres by 13 metres about 1,550km (960 miles) south-west of Perth. The release of the images coincided with an update from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) late on Saturday that a number of small objects had been visually identified by one of the search planes.

¡°During Saturday¡¯s search activities a civil aircraft tasked by Amsa reported sighting a number of small objects with the naked eye, including a wooden pallet, within a radius of five kilometres,¡± the statement said.

The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, had earlier announced on Thursday that a ¡°credible¡± sighting had been made in the Indian ocean, about 2,500km south-west of Perth, based on satellite imagery of two large objects.

The series of announcement has seen a major concentration of effort to scour the southern Indian Ocean for the plane, which went missing over two weeks ago. Eight aircraft have been tasked by Amsa to undertake the search, and vessels from the United States, New Zealand, China and Japan are also aiding in the operation.
