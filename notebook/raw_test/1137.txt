Walmart has announced that it will serve the 110 million gamers across the U.S. by allowing them to ,¡±unlock value in their current purchases and save even more when it comes to one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment.¡±

 

 Starting Wednesday, March 26, customers will be able to trade in their video games and apply the value immediately towards the purchase of anything sold at Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club, both in stores and online. The traded-in games will then be sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition at a great low price.

 

 ¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡± said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S. ¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They¡¯ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.¡±

 

 How it Works
 Customers bring their working video games, in the original packaging, to the electronics department.
 Associates scan the UPC code on the case and evaluate the game for obvious damage such as deep scratches or cracks.
 The customer is then provided with a trade-in value for each game to accept.
 The total value accepted by the customer is awarded immediately and can be applied at checkout in a Walmart store or Sam¡¯s Club, or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com
 Available at more than 3,100 Walmart stores nationwide, the new trade-in service will accept thousands of games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360. Trade-in value will vary.



 Certified Pre-Owned Video Games in Stores Later this Year

 

 Later this year, Walmart customers will also be able to purchase pre-owned video games in stores and on Walmart.com. The video games will be labeled ¡°Certified Pre-Owned¡± which means the product is fully refurbished and in like-new condition.

 

 ¡°While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we¡¯re glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games,¡± added Mac Naughton.
