VALLEY CENTER, CA - MARCH 5: An avocado grove is left to wither due to the rising cost of water, on March 5, 2014 near Valley Center, California. The Chipotle restaurant chain 2013 annual report concludes that increasing weather volatility as well as weather pattern changes and global climate change could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of their ingredients. As the costs of basics like avocados rise, Chipotle may reluctantly choose to temporarily drop some items from their menu such as guacamole and one or more salsas. Chipotle reportedly uses 97,000 pounds of avocados per day, about 35.4 million pounds per year.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) ¡ª A congressional committee will meet in Fresno on Wednesday, taking up California¡¯s drought crisis at the heart of the state¡¯s agricultural region.

The House Natural Resources Committee will hear testimony from Central Valley farmers, community leaders and state water officials ¡ª all grappling with the drought. The hearing at Fresno¡¯s City Hall is titled ¡°California Water Crisis and its Impacts: The Need for Immediate and Long-Term Solutions.¡±

¡°It is my hope that we will hear more about common ground and solutions that will bring more water to this Valley instead of rehashing the tired, partisan battles over California water,¡± Rep. Jim Costa, a Democrat from Fresno who serves on the committee, said Tuesday in a statement.

California is in its third consecutive dry year. Gov. Jerry Brown in January declared a drought emergency, and in February President Barack Obama visited to see the crisis firsthand, delivering millions in relief aid.

Water officials said Tuesday that February delivered promising rain, but they predict having to dramatically cut back on the water that farmers receive from a pair of vast systems of canals, reservoirs and dams operated by state and federal authorities. Many Central Valley farmers say they will leave fields unplanted.

The Natural Resources Committee has 47 members. A fraction of members are expected to attend, including Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington, who chairs the committee, along with Costa and Rep. Tom McClintock.

In advance of the hearing Tuesday, several California Republicans in Congress sent a letter to Obama and Brown urging them to use their powers to help farmers and communities hit hardest by the drought. Strict regulations aimed at protecting endangered fish allowed 445,000 acre-feet of water from February rains to be lost into the ocean, the letter said.

California¡¯s rainy season typically ends by April, said the letter signed by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who was among 13 to sign the letter.

¡°Given that communities in Central and Southern California are struggling to meet water needs and farmers are fallowing hundreds of thousands of acres of land that feed our state and country,¡± the letter said, ¡°loss of this water is absolutely unacceptable.¡±
