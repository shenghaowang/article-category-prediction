Herbalife Ltd., the nutrition company that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has accused of being a pyramid scheme, disclosed that the Federal Trade Commission has started a civil probe into its practices.

The company is confident it is in compliance with all laws and will cooperate with the investigation, Cayman Islands-based Herbalife said today in a statement.

The probe is a win for Ackman, who has said Herbalife misrepresents sales figures, misleads distributors and sells a commodity product at inflated prices. In 2012, Ackman said his New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management LP had sold short 20 million of the company¡¯s shares and started working to try to convince regulators to shut the company down.

¡°Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace,¡± the company said in the statement.

Herbalife rose 4.5 percent to $68.30 in New York before trading in the shares was halted.
