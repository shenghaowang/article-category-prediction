Wal-Mart Stores Inc.¡¯s namesake U.S. unit, seeking to combat slowing store traffic and reverse its fourth straight quarterly same-store sales decline, announced that will begin offering store credit for used videogames at its physical stores.

Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT , which started testing its plan to accept used games online last year, said it wants a share of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S., currently dominated by No. 1 videogame retailer GameStop Corp. /quotes/zigman/389699/delayed /quotes/nls/gme GME Other retailers, including Best Buy /quotes/zigman/219712/delayed /quotes/nls/bby BBY , also buy used videogames.

Its competitive advantage, Wal-Mart said, is that shoppers can use store credit from trade-ins to buy its wide variety of goods at both Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club stores.

¡°We just see it as a great opportunity to provide more access to gaming,¡± Walmart U.S. chief merchandising and marketing officer Duncan Mac Naughton told reporters on a call, adding the company decided to roll out the program at this time because the industry has come to an ¡°inflection point¡± following the introduction of new gaming consoles Xbox One and PlayStation 4 last year. ¡°There are 110 million gamers in the U.S. It¡¯s today¡¯s form of entertainment.¡±

The company, which already accepts trade-ins of pre-owned tablets and smartphones, said it will refurbish the pre-owned games for resale. The trade-in program doesn¡¯t include hardware consoles.

Wal-Mart, citing research firm NPD Group, said it¡¯s already the No. 2 U.S. seller of new physical videogame software and hardware. It said there are almost 1 billion units of used videogames that are sitting around in customers¡¯ homes.

While getting more of the 110 million gamers into its stores looks like a safe bet at a time when the company is seeking to increase traffic, it remains to be seen how big of an impact its entry may be. The videogame industry, faced with competition from digital games played on mobile phones and the Internet, has been in decline. According to NPD Group, total physical sales of videogame software in February saw an 11% drop.

However, the used-game business tends to be more profitable. GameStop has said it¡¯s the largest retailer of pre-owned videogames in the world, and that its used game business ¡ª with an average price of $19 ¡ª generates higher gross margins than do new game sales, with an average price of $41.

With Wal-Mart¡¯s entry, GameStop shares fell 5% on Tuesday in their biggest percentage decline since January. GameStop said in its most recent annual filing that its trade-in program, with about 3,100 game titles, gives it a ¡°unique value proposition¡± because such purchases are generally unavailable at mass merchants, toy stores and consumer-electronics retailers.

¡°We see this announcement as a profitability concern more than a market share concern¡± for GameStop, said Stifel analyst David Schick, adding pre-owned business represented 26% of GameStop¡¯s sales and 42% of its gross profit the last 12 months.
