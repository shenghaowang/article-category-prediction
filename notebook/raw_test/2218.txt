Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it will allow shoppers to trade in used video games for anything from groceries to gadgets across its 3,100 stores from March 26.

The trade-in service will accept games for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation3 and Microsoft Xbox 360, and customers can in return buy any item for sale at Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club, both in stores and online, Wal-Mart said.

¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡± Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a statement.

The traded-in games will be refurbished and made available to buyers later this year.

Retailers such as Best Buy Co., Target Corp. and GameStop Corp. also offer trade-in programs for used video games.
