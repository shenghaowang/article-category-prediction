The US has placed sanctions on twenty people and the Bank Rossiya, targeting Putin associates and some of the wealthiest businessmen in Russia.

Sanctions have not included Russian steel mills but Severstal is taking a beating anyway in the stock market as investors express concern over the Ukraine/Russian crisis. Shares in Severstal dropped 13 percent in March, for a loss of around $900 million. Likewise, Russian steel pipe producer TMK fell 19 percent reducing its market value by $500 million.
