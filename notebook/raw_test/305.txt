Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean has today addressed the North-East Chamber of Commerce, expressing the view that any additional strength for the pound would hamper a solid export-based recovery in Britain.

The comments sent the GBP/USD down to 1.66208 ¨C its lowest level this month. As well, and for the first time since mid-February, the pair slipped below its 20-day Simple Moving Average, currently near 1.6661.

In a rare observation on the pound¡¯s rate of exchange by a member of the BoE¡¯s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, Bean told the assembled business-people: "Any further appreciation of sterling, which has risen almost 10 percent in trade-weighted terms since March [2013], would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports." said Bean

Last month fellow-MPC member Ian McCafferty noted that if sterling were to continue its rise against the currencies of some the UK's key trading partners he "would get more worried¡±. On 14 February, the GBP/USD hit a three-year high of 1.38217 but since then the currency pair has largely been treading water.

More generally, sterling has been strengthening against the greenback on account of market conviction that the UK central bank will start hiking rates before the US Federal Reserve.

¡°It is still early days and the MPC will be doing its utmost to ensure that recovery is not nipped in the bud,¡± said Bean today. ¡°But when the time does come for us to start raising Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.¡±

He reiterated that the BoE wants to see a ¡°revival¡± in business investment, productivity growth and a deficit-shrinking boost in exports before proclaiming that the UK recovery is sustainable. For that reason, Bean shared, the MPC ¡°is keeping a beady eye on the housing market¡±.

Right now, the GBP/USD is trading at around 1.6639, down 0.5 percent intraday.
