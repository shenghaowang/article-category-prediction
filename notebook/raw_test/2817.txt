New Jersey¡¯s labor market kicked off 2014 on a few sour notes.

According to preliminary data yesterday from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state lost 3,900 jobs during the first month of the year.

 Meanwhile, the state made scant progress over the past year toward returning to the peak employment levels it reached exactly six years earlier.

In January 2008, New Jersey boasted a record 4.092 million jobs, according to data provided by Patrick O¡¯Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick in Roseland.

Six years on, the Garden State is more than 167,000 jobs shy of that number, as the state reported an estimated 3.925 million jobs for January. And the 5,600 jobs the state added between January 2013 and January 2014 barely closes the gap.

"In 2013, we made less progress in the recovery than we thought," said O¡¯Keefe, a former deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor.

According to New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal-leaning think tank, the state has recovered just 37 percent of the jobs it lost during the recession. New York has recovered 163 percent and Pennsylvania 78 percent.

One area where New Jersey has made significant progress is its unemployment rate. The state¡¯s jobless rate fell to 7.1 percent in January from 8.9 percent a year earlier. This drop puts the state closer to the national average, which stood at 6.6 percent in January and climbed to 6.7 percent in February.

But as O¡¯Keefe noted, the drop in New Jersey¡¯s unemployment rate had little to do with people getting jobs, but rather with people dropping out of the labor force. Yesterday¡¯s data showed that the civilian labor force ¡ª or the count of working-age people who either have a job or are looking for one ¡ª shrank by more than 100,000 over the 12-month period ending in January.

In an interview, state Labor Department Commissioner Harold Wirths said he believed the declines in the labor force are due in part to people retiring rather than just giving up on finding work. But he acknowledged that the state, with its high taxes and heavy regulation, is lagging the nation when it comes to creating jobs.

"We definitely have a lot more work to do," he said. He expects big projects such as the Pulaski Skyway overhaul and completion of the American Dream Meadowlands in East Rutherford to create more jobs.

The January data still is subject to revisions as more complete and accurate data comes in.

 "These preliminary numbers almost mean nothing," said Wirths, whose department issues the monthly jobs reports derived from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The first set of revisions occur when the state issues its February jobs report on March 27. The data also may be tweaked again when it undergoes annual "benchmarking" next year, a process meant to make it more accurate.

It was this benchmarking process that state officials gave the most attention yesterday.

 Along with the January jobs numbers, the Labor Department also released benchmarked numbers for 2012 and 2013. Among other things, the data showed that the state gained more jobs last year than initially estimated, and that its persistently high unemployment rate has been mostly lower than previously reported.

The average unemployment rate in New Jersey last year was 8.2 percent, rather than 8.4 percent. Meanwhile, the average jobless rate for 2012 was revised down to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent.

Meanwhile, the state added 18,800 jobs in 2013, compared to earlier estimates that it would add just 10,100 jobs. All of the job gains were in the private sector, while the public sector shed 1,000 jobs last year. Earlier estimates saw the private sector gain just 7,300 positions last year. Also, December¡¯s job losses, initially reported at 36,300, were revised lower to 19,100 jobs lost.

However, any boost this provided was offset by the finding that 2012 provided a smaller job haul than originally reported. Yesterday¡¯s benchmarked data showed that the state gained just 43,900 jobs in 2012, or about a third less than the 66,400 jobs originally reported for the year.

With respect to the January and December job losses, the bitter winter did play a part, Charles Steindel, chief economist for the state Department of Treasury said in a statement, though he expects this too will abate.

"As is typically the case after such an episode, there¡¯s a good chance the pace will pick up as the temperatures rise," he wrote.
