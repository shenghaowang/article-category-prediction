Open enrollment for Obamacare ends on March 31 and in the race to meet its projected goals, the Obama administration is spending plenty of money to promote the presidents signature healthcare law.

That¡¯s an average of $17 million a month on advertising, or $9 per signup if the administration reaches its revised enrollment goal of six million, The Daily Caller pointed out.

Which is still just a small percentage of the estimated $684 million that will be spent overall on publicity, marketing and advertising the Affordable Care Act, according to The Associated Press.

With ten days left until the deadline, the administration needs an additional one million people to sign up to meet its enrollment goal. Adding to its problems, the critical 18-35 demographic accounts for just 25 percent of the total, compared to original projections of 38.5 percent.

A reality that explains the growing number of unconventional appearances by President Obama to reach young adults.

Obamacare was designed to provide health insurance to the approximately 16 percent of Americans who are uninsured, and any real measure of success will be in accordance to the extent this number is reduced.

Assuming the ¡°most transparent administration ever¡± is willing to share the figures.
