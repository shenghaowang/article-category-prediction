NEW YORK¡ªSecurity software maker Symantec says it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett and named director Michael Brown as his temporary replacement.

Bennett has been president and CEO of the company since July 2012. Symantec said that he resigned from the board of directors after his termination. He was also chairman of the company until Symantec split the chairman and CEO roles in January 2013.

The Mountain View, Calif., company did not cite a precise reason for Bennett¡¯s ouster.

¡°This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety,¡± Symantec Chairman Dan Schulman said in a press release.

Brown has been with the company since July 2005. He is the former chairman and CEO of Quantum Corp.
