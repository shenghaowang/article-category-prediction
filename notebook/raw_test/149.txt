Struggling retail chain JCPenney (JCP) received a vote of confidence from one of the nation¡¯s largest banks, sending JCP stock surging more than 7% in Tuesday morning trading.

Analysts at Citigroup (C) raised their rating on JCP stock to ¡°Buy.¡± Citigroup also increased its price target for JCP stock to $11, citing the retailer¡¯s renewed focus on children¡¯s and home products, Seeking Alpha notes.

Last month, JCP stock climbed after the company reported an adjusted fourth-quarter loss of 68 cents per share. That surprised analysts who had predicted a loss of 85 cents per share of JCP stock.

However, JCP¡¯s fourth-quarter sales of $3.78 billion fell short of the $3.85 billion that Wall Street had expected.

JCP stock closed at $8.42 on Monday. Over the past year, JCP stock has dropped more than 40%.
