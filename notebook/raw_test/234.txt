Harley-Davidson Inc. shares dropped 6.6% in Tuesday morning trade after the company said it is voluntarily recalling nearly 240,000 motorcycles. The company expects the recall to cost $35 million, which will be booked in the fourth quarter. Harley-Davidson disclosed the news after reporting third-quarter profit and revenue beats early Tuesday, which initially propelled the stock up. Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $113.86 million, or 68 cents per share, from $68.21 million, or 40 cents per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were 78 cents, compared with the FactSet consensus of 53 cents. The latest results reflect improved international retail sales growth, the company said, even as its U.S. retail sales and worldwide retail sales declined from the previous year's rates. The company also has a multi-year manufacturing optimization plan in place, with costs related to it totaling around $21 million in the third quarter. Third-quarter revenue rose to $1.32 billion from $1.15 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.07 billion. The company continues to expect 2018 motorcycle shipments of between 231,000 to 236,000 and motorcycles segment operating margin to make up about 9% to 10% of its revenue. Harley-Davidson now expects financial services segment operating income to be up, compared with previous expectations of flat to up slightly, a lower tax rate than previously expected, or 22.5% to 24%, and fewer capital expenditures than previously expected, or between $230 million and $250 million, compared with a previous estimate of $250 million to $270 million. Company shares have dropped 12.4% over the last three months, compared with a 3.2% decline in the S&P 500 and a 0.2% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
