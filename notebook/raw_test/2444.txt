MANNHEIM, Germany, March 18 (Reuters) - German analyst and investor sentiment fell much more than expected in March, hitting its lowest level since August 2013, amid fears the crisis in Ukraine could weigh heavily on Europe¡¯s largest economy.

The Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank¡¯s monthly poll of economic sentiment dropped to 46.6 from 55.7 in February, falling short of even the lowest forecast of 49.9 in a Reuters poll of analysts. The consensus forecast was for 53.0.

A ZEW economist said the Ukraine crisis had played a ¡°very important part¡± in the indictor¡¯s decline.

The index was based on a survey of 241 analysts and investors conducted between March 3 and March 17, ZEW said. A separate gauge of current conditions rose to 51.3 points from 50.0 in February, slightly undershooting the forecast for a reading of 52.0.
