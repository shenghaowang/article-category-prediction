TRENTON, N.J. (AP) ¡ª New Jersey employers added 13,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate fell from 4.3 percent to 4.2 percent.

The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development announced the Bureau of Labor Statistics data from last month on Thursday.

The department says the job growth was in part fueled by the opening of two casino hotels in Atlantic City.

The biggest gains were in leisure and hospitality, which added 7,000 jobs while construction jobs contracted by 1,000.

The national unemployment rate for July was 3.9 percent.
