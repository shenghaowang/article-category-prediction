Ebay sellers are flogging their shiny new 1 coins for hundreds of pounds online, thanks to a series of production errors which collectors are desperate to get their hands on.

Huge numbers of the new 12-sided editions, dubbed 'counterfeit proof' by the Royal Mint, have entered circulation with striking errors, including an upside down Queen's head and in some cases, a missing Queen's head altogether.

And while the coins are legal tender - meaning you can use them to pay for goods - they're selling like hotcakes online, with one coin - the bestseller so far - racking up 15 bids in total - and a 294.00 profit.

The coin - which was sold on eBay - featured a glaring cutting error, which made it highly sought after by collectors.

Ebayer mcellenbear made the second biggest online profit out of the faulty new coins last month, raking in 250 for her coin, which was missing the Queen's effigy entirely.

The listing read: "1 coin dated 2016 with one side blank on silver middle section. The coin appears to have missed the striking stage for the silver centre piece where the Queen's head should be and is just blank shiny silver and flat."

The sale last month has been followed by dozens more listings, with opportunistic sellers cashing in on their luck at landing themselves the super rare editions.

One member, robbiethebarge9 even managed to get his hands on two - but admitted he's saving one for his own collection.

The third most lucrative of all the coins appear to be the misshapen ones, which have sold for up to 104 on eBay to date. These include coins where the Queen's head is slightly tilted, the sides are rigid - instead of smooth - and the text is upside down.

Ebayer ben-crawford2010 received two of the coins at once at a local store, both of which appear to feature an upside down Queen's head.

The member said: "It seems unusual and very striking. Thought someone would be interested in this, got it down the road in the shop with another one."

How many 'rare' coins are there?

Speaking about the faulty coins, a Royal Mint spokesman said a number of 'variances' are likely.

¡°We have tight quality controls in place. However, variances will always occur in a small number of coins, particularly in the striking process, due to the high volumes and speed of production."

A spokesperson for GoCompare.com's Coining It In project added: "There have been multiple striking errors popping up on online auction sites. Examples include a misaligned patterns, off-centre designs, and others where there is no visible striking what-so-ever on the obverse side, resulting in a completely blank silver disc where the Queen's head usually sits.

"Collectors will be hot on the tail of these striking errors, and anyone lucky enough to find one of the above in circulation should certainly look into getting it valued."

Chards , a UK gold and metal dealership, said: "Since the release of the 12 sided one pound coin, we have had an abundance of enquiries about errors.

"These include reports of gaps between the two components of the coin, a lack of micro lettering, an absence of hologram on the lined shield, strange flattened edges, coins which are all one 'colour' usually the brass finish, inner discs obverse being married with reverse outer rings and coins actually falling apart.

"With approx 2,000 coins being struck a minute and the huge rush to meet demand, it appears that coins with striking errors that should have been picked up during quality control have been released into circulation.

"Occasionally, a misshapen or incorrectly sized core is inserted resulting in gaps between the inner disc and outer ring."

What to do if you spot a rare coin

Despite being labelled as 'faulty', the coins are still legal tender, therefore you can still use them in supermarkets or banks.

However, if you choose to sell your coin on for a profit, you can do so online through a marketplace such as eBay, Gumtree or similar. Alternatively, sell it to an auctioneer or registered coin dealer.

To get your coin valued by a local coin collector, head to The Royal Numismatic Society or the CoinCraft website . If you're in London, Numis.co.uk has a handy list of regional dealers here .

If you are selling online and aren't quite sure what your coin is worth, search for the coin (and its fault) on eBay and tick the 'sold' box on the left hand side. This will help filter out any over-exaggerated and failed listings.
