The U.S. Federal Reserve should proceed cautiously in scaling back its asset purchase program, while signaling its intentions clearly so as to minimize the impact on developing economies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday.

In an update to forecasts made in November, the Paris-based research body said growth is set to pick up in most large developed economies over coming years, but slowdowns in some large developing economies mean global economic growth is likely to remain moderate.

It said that while it believes the dip in growth in the U.S. during the final three months of last year and the first three months of this year is due to unusually severe weather and is likely to be short-lived, it is possible that ¡°less transitory¡± forces are at work, including a rise in long-term interest rates over the past year.

Given the uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. recovery, and the impact tapering may have on developing economies, the OECD said while it is right for the U.S. Federal Reserve to scale back its asset purchase program, it should do so gradually over the next two years.

The OECD said the potential for further periods of financial market volatility and capital outflows from developing economies as the Fed and other central banks prepare to reduce their stimulus is one of the most significant threats to the global recovery.
