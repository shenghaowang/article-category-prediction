Shares of Symantec sunk 9.4% in pre-market trading Friday after the computer security firm surprised investors by firing its CEO.

On Thursday, Symantec announced it fired president and CEO Steve Bennett. Board member Michael Brown will fill his role on an interim basis while a special committee begins a search for a new CEO.

"This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," said chairman Daniel Schulman in a statement representing Symantec's board of directors.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Symantec is sticking with its fourth-quarter forecast, which has the company raking in between $1.615 billion and $1.655 billion in revenue.

Bennett's firing marks another tumble for Symantec shares since reaching a 52-week high of $26.96 on August 13. In pre-market trading, shares are below $20. The last time Symantec stock closed under $20 was January 2013.
