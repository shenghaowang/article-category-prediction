Licking the wounds after a visit from the biotechology bears¡­

Several big biotech names tumbled Friday, some more than 8%, leaving a sea of red for investors. But is the sell-off long term or just a dreary day on Wall Street?

Many thought the selloff was due to Democratic lawmakers coming down on Gilead Sciences Inc. /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD over the pricing of its promising new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which is $84,000 for a 12-week treatment. Shares ended the day off more than 4% to $72.07.

But there also have been mounting worries over froth forming in the biotech sector and a possible correction on the horizon. It probably won¡¯t be known just how meaningful Friday¡¯s selloff was until next week, or beyond. There is one cause for concern, though, as four major biotech exchange-traded funds all lost more than 4% with many hitting historic lows.

One frequently watched gauge among ETFs, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB , dropped nearly 5% when it was all over. It was noted that the fund neared its 100-day moving average by RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.

Yee noted that ¡°sentiment is rolling over in biotech a bit¡± in a note on one big name in the sector, Celgene Corp. /quotes/zigman/69584/delayed /quotes/nls/celg CELG , which lost nearly 4% to $144.40 at the close. He also noted that even though Celgene won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday for Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug, that stock crashed its 200-day moving average.

¡°However, we¡¯ll state it again that the fundamentals [on Celgene] haven¡¯t changed,¡± he said. Yee contends the launch of Otezla should be uneventful.

ISI Group¡¯s Mark Schoenebaum noted data shows the drug isn¡¯t as powerful as competing treatments but has fewer side effects and is cheaper ¡ª perhaps a strong suit considering Gilead¡¯s pricing issues. He says although a full-year of Otezla is priced at $22,500, it still is a discount to virtually all other drugs used for the same treatment. And consensus shows it should bring in more than $1 billion in revenue by 2017.
