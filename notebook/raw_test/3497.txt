Walmart has announced plans to jump into the used video game market, no doubt to the ire of publishers and GameStops everywhere. Starting March 26, any one of its 3,100 stores will be happy to take your unwanted games off of your hands for a gift card usable at any Walmart or Sam＊s Club location.

Used game＊s are not simply slapped with a price tag and put immediately on the shelf, though. Walmart states in its press releases that all used games will be ※sent to be refurbished and made available for purchase in like-new condition starting this summer.§ Maybe they will be factory sealed and given a stamp of approval, but how do you refurbish a disc or 3DS cart?

Games can be traded in online, but hardware must be done through a store, and Walmart even has an online calculator which will help you estimate the value of your trade. For example, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword will land you a price of $30 with the case and manual intact, and Grand Theft Auto V sells for $28. Not too shabby.

It＊s been a while since I＊ve trade away any games to a retail store. I like to keep the games I dream about playing again some day. So many games, so little time. However, when I finally took an axe to my huge video game collection last year, all of the games I sold went through Amazon or eBay, not to a retail store, and I made so much more money because of it.

My collector＊s mentality still hasn＊t forgiven me, though. Oh, my beautiful copy of Panzer Dragoon Saga＃ it＊s gone!

Anybody going to try trading in with Walmart, or are GameStop, Best Buy, and Amazon still your best bet for trade-ins?
