A Chinese satellite searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 airliner may have located the crash site at sea, according to a Chinese government agency.

A Chinese satellite investigating the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has ¡°observed a suspected crash area at sea,¡± according to China¡¯s State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

Officials may finally have a promising lead on the whereabouts of Flight 370, after the plane carrying 239 people ¡ª including three Americans and five infants ¡ª vanished on March 8.

The Chinese satellite captured images of what are believed to be ¡°three suspected floating objects and their sizes,¡± CNN reports. The pictures were taken on March 9, one day after the plane went missing, but were not released until March 12.

The sizable objects in question were found in the water, south of Vietnam, and northeast of where the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

CIA officials are also investigating the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and the director of the agency revealed earlier on March 10 that a possible suicide attempt by the pilot could have brought down the missing plane.

¡°I think you cannot discount any theory,¡± CIA head John Brennan said when asked if it was possible that the pilot deliberately crashed the Boeing 777.

This theory could explain how the plane ¡°disappeared¡± from civilian radar tracking its movements. The pilot could have simply turned off the transponder shortly before it disappeared. We hope this tragic mystery is solved soon.
