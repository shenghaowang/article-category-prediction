Silver today tumbled to a 5-week low of $20.225 as the market fine-tuned its expectation for the start of US interest rate-tightening, following yesterday¡¯s monetary policy decision by the Federal Open Market Committee.

The Federal Reserve¡¯s rate-setting arm yesterday announced another $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of its quantitative easing programme, tapering it to $55 billion per month. Janet Yellen, in her first FOMC meeting as Fed chair, surprised the market by indicating that the first US rate hike since the financial crisis could happen ¡°around six months¡± after the end of the QE program, which she sees concluding this autumn.

If the Committee continues with its gradual $10 billion taper-steps per meeting, the asset purchases would be halted this October, which would imply that Yellen expects rate-tightening to start in April 2015. ¡°The market isn¡¯t pricing the first hike until August next year¡±, emphasizes Danske Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren.

Following the policy decision, US Treasury yields and the greenback have been on the rise, while bullion prices have been hammered from the hawkish surprise by the US central bank. It is worth noting that after the Fed had announced taper-step number two on 29 January, silver found a bottom the very next day.

However, analysts at Credit Agricole underline that the latest shift in rate-tightening expectations may turn out to be ¡°the catalyst of a sustained rise in US Treasury yields and broad USD strength¡± that a lot of market participants have been expecting.

Yellen¡¯s remarks were also backed by the Committee¡¯s median rate path forecasts for end-2015 and end-2016, which were revised higher from 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent and from 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent respectively. The FOMC also ditched the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold embedded in its forward guidance.

Right now, silver is trading at 20.321, down 1.5 percent intraday.
