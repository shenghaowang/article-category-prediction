Here's the issues WM has to overcome:

No cash- lots of GS's trades come from people wanting cash, one of the reasons Target, BB, and TRU trade programs didn't take off. Argument can be made that WM GC is as good as cash, but isn't a Target one as well? Lots of those cash trades are for gas money (yes GS has Shell GC but not all areas have Shell stations and many cash trades are under $25.)

Actually selling the games they take in- You have to make money by selling the games taken in. How many times has the used price of a game at BB been more than the new cost? How about the selection of used games at TRU or Target? Also no rewards program at Walmart.

Condition of the games- GS will take any game in as long as it's not cracked. How will WM handle that? Will they have a return policy, unlike their current used game sales where there's no returns? GS's return policy is one of the best for used games (7 day satisfaction, 30 days defective.)

Pricing the TIV correctly- What happens if Walmart gives stupid amounts of credit for games they won't be able to resell to profit from? What if GS values are greater, as they generally are than BB's outside of BB's 100% bonus weeks?

Employee education- Yeah there's lots of bad GS locations, but even the bad GS's are generally better than Walmart. I've tried to buy stuff at WM in Electronics and just get blank stares. Also what about games w/o serial numbers or games with special serial numbers that are a retailer exclusive like the Target exclusive Square Enix Steelbook games? With as few staffers as WM puts in Electronics, can you imagine the holdups when trades are introduced?

Just some things to think about before all of CAG declares GS dead.
