Mulberry CEO Bruno Guillon has resigned. The British brand confirmed last night that the businessman has stepped down from his position following a two year tenure, effective immediately.

Godfrey Davis, the company's non-executive chairman and former CEO, will become executive chairman until a successor is named. He released a statement thanking Guillon for "his hard work over the past two years", reports WWD.

"He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and [he has] grown international retail sales," said Davis. "I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved."

The news follows a somewhat turbulent period for the British brand, which has seen profit warnings in recent months and been without a creative director since Emma Hill's departure last summer. The label opted out of hosting a London Fashion Week show this season, opting instead to hold a presentation during which they unveiled a new collection of handbags designed in collaboration with Cara Delevingne.
