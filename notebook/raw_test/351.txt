Mumbai: , India¡¯s second largest luxury car maker, will assemble its premium S Class model locally, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The move, it said, will help the firm address increasing demand for the model. It has a waiting period of some three months.

Priced at 1.36 crore, the S Class 500 will be the fifth Mercedes-Benz model to be assembled at the company¡¯s facility in Chakan, Pune. The other models assembled here are the E-Class, C-Class, GL-Class and the M-Class. The A-Class, CLS-Class, SLK-Class and the luxury tourer B-Class are imported.

The company is also initiating a chauffeur training programme for the S Class customers. The 21 modules in the programme focus on enhancing chauffeurs¡¯ soft skills, etiquette, personal development, courtesy and safety.

Encouraged by the small but fast-expanding tribe of luxury car owners, makers of global luxury cars have identified India as an important market. In 2013, about 30,000 luxury cars were sold in India, an expansion of 25% over the previous year. This was in a year when the mass car market saw its first annual decline in 11 years.
