Remember that time you walked into a big chain store with a shopping bag full of games, thinking you were going to cash out big time, only to leave with a gift card housing barely enough credit to grab even one new game? Of course you do; we've all been there.

GameStop used to be the only option in town, but now that there are more choices for the eager trader, the trade-in experience has to have progressed in some way, right? Are we better off sticking to Amazon and eBay's third-party seller marketplace to peddle our unwanted games, or have these chains finally come together to offer an experience that doesn't sacrifice payout for convenience? I decided that it was time to find out just what these big chains have to offer.

We could talk about the overall experience offered by each chain, but what it all comes down to is how much these companies are willing to shell out for your unwanted games, right? Let's take a look at how some of the trade-in values stack up.

Note: These values were retrieved in late March, 2014.

The Last of Us (PS3) - $16

The Last of Us (PS3) - $18

Assassin's Creed IV (Xbox One) - Not found in system

The Last of Us (PS3) - $14.49

The Last of Us (PS3) - $16.80

The Last of Us (PS3) - $16.80

The Last of Us (PS3) - $6.86

While time might not exactly be money, nobody wants to waste their afternoon (or wait forever to get their money after sending games into an online trade store). So in an attempt to see who was the most efficient, I timed each of the experiences I had in trading in an equal number of games to each company.

Note: These times are based on an average over two visits (one in February, one in March) to store locations found in suburban South Austin during the weekend. The only exception to this is Walmart, which was only visited in March when the chain started accepting in-store trade-ins.

Best Buy: 0:21 to being helped, 6:12 to complete trade-in process

GameStop: 0:11 to being helped, 4:06 to complete trade-in process

Target: 0:55 to being helped, 6:44 to complete trade-in process

Walmart: 1:05 to being helped, 14:25 to complete trade-in process

Walmart.com: 2 days to receive my shipment, 1 additional day to verify trade-in/email eGift Card

Amazon.com: 8 days to receive my shipment, 1 additional day to verify trade-in/notify of receipt

The following conversations took place on two separate visits to each chain. One visit was on a Saturday morning, while the other was on a Wednesday evening in order to get a diverse set of employees. All I had to do was sell myself as knowing absolutely nothing about video games and then see how much leading I had to do to get them to give an acceptable answer. Here's what I took away from my interactions.
 Employees knowledgeable about the differences between PS4 and Xbox One
 Since trades are processed through customer service line, one employee started panicking a little when I began asking too many gaming questions and called for back-up from the games department
 Didn't speak too highly of the Wii U

Memorable Quote from Employee: [In response to the question, "What about the Wii U?"] "Nah, that's mostly kids games."
 Probably the most knowledgeable, though some errors were made (like saying Forza 5 was the only Xbox One exclusive, and that Gran Turismo 6 was a PS4 exclusive)
 Very enthusiastic responses and very willing to chat about gaming if nobody is in line
 Very good at giving recommendations based on their personal experiences

Memorable Quote from Employee: "I like the Wii U. I really do. It's not going to have the same kind of games that Xbox One and PS4 have, but it does have Mario Kart 8 and Smash Bros. coming out soon, and it also has a bunch of time honored classics like Metroid and Earthbound that you can download right to your system. That means instead of spending $500 on Earthbound, you can grab it for $10."
 Employees in Electronics Department were knowledgeable, while the ones who processed the trades in the Mobile Department ranged from having solid opinions on gaming to having no gaming knowledge whatsoever
 Very friendly and casual when answering questions
 One employee did a good job of referencing pre-order cards when I asked about upcoming games

Memorable Quote from Employee: "The Xbox One has too many bells and whistles for me. I don't need voice controls and all the apps¡ªI just want to play games. I can tell more people are going PS4 because during the holidays we'd get shipments of both, and the PS4s would sell out immediately."
 Probably the most genuinely friendly employees I encountered
 One employee had no idea what Titanfall was just weeks before its launch
 Employees compensated for lack of gaming knowledge by using general customer service recommendations like "go with the brand you know" or "listen to your friends' recommendations"

Memorable Quote from Employee: "I'm not sure [about any upcoming games]. They don't tell us a whole lot in advance."

Bottom Line: Obviously, the results found in this section are far from scientific. Every company has knowledgeable and less-than-knowledgeable employees. These results were retrieved from two separate employees within the stores in the Austin, TX area, meaning that each experience will be different. Have you had a vastly different experience from the ones I had? Let us know in the comments!

But what about the rules and regulations? The membership programs? The bonuses? We reached out to GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart to talk a bit more about the trade-in marketplace. All four companies we spoke to stressed the importance of the video game trade-in programs they've established.

If you're planning on heading to trade in your games, you'll want to bring your photo ID with you, as each of the stores require that one be presented alongside your trades. While none of these retailers charge additional fees to process your trades, you'll want to take your unwanted N64 and Genesis games elsewhere, as none of these major chains will accept retro titles.

 Gift cards are extremely versatile as they can be used for anything at Walmart or Sam's Club
 Will not provided any trade value for non-working items
 Requires original packaging for trade to receive any value

The trade-in values you saw earlier were from the second run of my experiment, but what about the first time through? Below, you'll find the values from February 2014, which show an inconsistent amount of fluctuation. While gamers typically assume a game's value will steadily decrease as it ages, I actually found that some of them increased during my second trip to these stores. According to the representatives of many of the stores, this is due to the values being based on supply and demand, along with staying competitive with the other retailers in this space.

Best Buy; Total: $77 (Compared to $71 in March)

Assassin's Creed IV (Xbox One) - $32

Battlefield 4 (PS3) - $20

 The associates knew what they were talking about for the most part
 Trade-in values were generally higher than those being offered by any other retailer
 The company doesn't frequently update its system with new releases, so if you're looking to trade a game in immediately, there may be times where you'll have to wait a week or two to do so
 Will get you in and out in the shortest amount of time
 Trade values are not as high as Best Buy or Walmart on many occasions
 More pressure to pre-order upcoming games than other stores
 Walmart gift cards, which are given for trades, can be used for anything found in a Walmart or Sam's Club, making the trade-in amounts more valuable to many
 Target gift cards, which are given for trades, can be used for anything found in Target stores, making the trade-in amounts more valuable for many
 Slower than either Best Buy or GameStop
 Games available to trade were extremely inconsistent
 Trade-ins are processed through the Mobile department, which did nothing but hinder the experience greatly (experiences include: finding out Target's Mobile department has different hours than the store itself, the Mobile employee was on break, or the games weren't in the trade-in system)
 Does a good job of remaining competitive with its trade-in values
 Can take up to a week to receive trade-in credit in your account
 Values are not as high as the prices that games are going for through third-party sales (selling the game on Amazon's Seller Marketplace appears to be the better option)

Of course, there's one missing element from this experiment: non-chain game stores. Whether you're talking The Exchange in Pittsburgh, 8-Bit and Up in Manhattan, or Game Over Video Games in Austin, many locally-based "mom & pop" shops offer higher values and a more customizable experience than any of the chains are able to do.

The key to getting the best overall experience is to shop around and find out which shop can meet your needs the best, while keeping your eyes open for promotions at the other stores.
