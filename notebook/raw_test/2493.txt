Mt. Gox, the online Bitcoin exchange that has filed for bankruptcy, said Thursday it has found 200,000 missing bitcoins during a search of its systems.

The Tokyo-based company said the missing coins were found March 7 during a search of its old-format ¡°wallets¡± and that the coins have since been moved offline for security reasons. The Japanese court that is overseeing its bankruptcy proceedings has been notified, the company said in a statement on its website.

The recovered bitcoins are valued at about $115 million at current prices.

When it filed for bankruptcy late last month, Mt. Gox had reported that 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing and said it was likely they were stolen.

The company is still investigating the 650,000 bitcoins that remain unaccounted for.
