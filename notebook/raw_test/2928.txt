Gamers can exchange their video games for the worth any product in a Wal-Mart or Sam's Club location on site or on the internet beginning Wed. March 26

Wal-Mart will then prepare for store shelves at a discounted price than the amount it was originally bought for a press release on the company's website reported.

"Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we're actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity," Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer at Wal-Mart in the United States said in a statement. "When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want."

"While new releases will remain the focus of our gaming business, we're glad to give our customers the option to buy pre-owned games," Mac Naughton said in a statement.

According to the press release, games must be in the materials they came in, and brought to the electronics department in any Wal-Mart store,

Store employees will enter the game into their system, and check the product to see what wear and tear it has including deep scratches, or cracks the press release reported.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," Justin Williamson, director of entertainment at Wal-Mart said in a statement on the company's blog.

Wal-Mart will then give customers the amount the game is worth so they can use the funds on another product at Wal-Mart's over 3,100 locations throughout the United States.

The process applies for every game someone turns into the program, dubbed the video game trade-in program the press release reported.

Thousands of games compatible with Sony PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Xbox 360 are eligible for the program.
