Vladimir Putin turned up more than an hour late for a speech to Russia¡¯s business elite on Thursday. This was not an insult, however, since he is habitually late. The Russian president once made his (now deposed) Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yanukovich cool his heels for four hours while he hung out with a biker gang. In the circumstances, making some of the richest people in Russia sit around for a mere 80 minutes was practically a mark of esteem.

Putin spoke for just five minutes and did not find time to mention Ukraine, Crimea, the weakening rouble or the plunging Russian markets. Instead, he focused on a different project¡ª¡°de-offshore-ization.¡± It is an ugly word and it sounds, if anything, even uglier in Russian, especially when Putin says it: de-offshorizatsiya. But it is one he likes, and he has been pushing it since 2008.

¡°Russian companies must be registered on our, on their own territory, on the territory of our country and they must have a transparent property structure. I am convinced you are also interested in this,¡± Putin told his crowd.

What sounds like a rather dry proposal for some changes to Russian financial regulation gained dramatic urgency just minutes later, when the White House issued sanctions against Kremlin insiders. U.S. individuals and companies were suddenly barred from doing business with some of Putin¡¯s best friends.

The impact was immediate. Visa and Mastercard stopped servicing several Russian banks, thus blocking their clients¡¯ ability to use ATMs. When the markets opened the next day in Moscow, shares in companies linked to people on the list plunged. Novatek, a gas company partly owned by the sanctioned Gennady Timchenko, lost 12 percent as investors piled out.

In announcing the sanctions, President Barack Obama spoke of the ¡°costs¡± they would impose on Putin¡¯s inner circle, and a senior administration official later called them ¡°very powerful¡± and strongly denied they are ¡°a mere wrist slap.¡±

The costs to Russia are undoubtedly severe but, as Russian businessmen scramble to get their money out of America¡¯s reach, Putin may be secretly pleased.

Since Russia opened up in the 1990s, Russian businessmen have become adept at using the offshore banking sectors of the world to hide their wealth. In this, they are no different than Western businesses, who also park their cash places where their governments can¡¯t get at it, but they do it on a totally different scale.

According to the most recent figures from the Russian Central Bank (for the third quarter of last year), the biggest investor in the country was Cyprus ($4.5 billion), followed by the British Virgin Islands ($2.7 billion), Luxembourg ($1.6 billion) and the isle of Jersey¡ªall of which are generally considered to be tax havens. China, Russia¡¯s most powerful neighbour, invested $193 million during the quarter, less than Bermuda. Germany invested $428 million, little more than half the total from the Bahamas.

This is not Bahamian money, earned by hard-working hoteliers and invested in Russia in the hope of good returns. It is Russian money, part of the vast outflow that has left the country in the last two decades, and come to rest in bank accounts around the world. Last year, $63 billion left Russia. Thanks to the post-Crimea political turbulence, financial analysts predict that 2014¡¯s total will be double that.

This not only impoverishes Russia, it also complicates Putin¡¯s task of bringing everything in the country within his reach¡ªhence, his desire to de-offshore-ize it.

¡°The oligarchs become much more beholden to him if their money is effectively under his control. They go from being independently wealthy to ¡®dependently wealthy,¡¯¡± Bill Browder, who was a huge portfolio investor in Russia in Putin¡¯s early years, but who was barred from entering the country in 2006, told me. ¡°Going forward Putin wants them to depend on him to maintain their wealth and not have it taken away.¡±

Since coming to power, Putin has made it his goal to restore the Kremlin¡¯s power: by crushing Chechnya, by cancelling elections, by controlling the media and by squashing over-mighty oligarchs who felt they could challenge him.
