The familiarity of a 1 coin nestling in your trouser pocket will soon be a thing of the past when chancellor George Osborne announces a replacement for the high-value in today¡¯s budget.

Introduced just 30 years ago the coin has been beset by mass counterfeiting, undermining confidence in the currency and forcing the Royal Mint to respond with a new, more elaborate, design to beat the forgers.

In its place will come a 12-sided dual metal coin, described as the ¡®most secure¡¯ in the world.

To be introduced from 2017 it will feature the Queen¡¯s head on one side with a public competition set to be staged to determine what artwork adorns the reverse.

Estimates published by the Royal mint suggest as many as 45m 1 coins currently in circulation are forgeries.
