So, you thought the messaging mania would go away after Facebook bought What¡¯sApp?

There¡¯s still more money ¨C lots of it ¨C flying around Silicon Valley aimed at those who text and send songs to each other. The latest jaw-dropping deal brings a $280 million funding round to Mountain View¡¯s Tango. Tango is a messaging app, getting more sticky by the day as users play games and send photos and songs to each other. It¡¯s got more than 200 million users worldwide to go with all that cash.

The funding round, led by China¡¯s soon-to-IPO Alibaba (talk about a company about to come into some money¡­), will bring lots of growth to Tango.

Co-Founder Eric Setton, in an interview at company HQ, told NBC Bay Area ¡°we're looking to make progress in terms of staffing...and add here in Mountain View as well as Beijing, China, where we have offices.¡±

International growth, for a company that has big growth plans.

But is all this money (for texting apps!) a sign of another bubble? Santa Clara University Business professor Robert Hendershott says maybe. Admitting that it¡¯s crazy money flying around the Valley, he admits that this could also be a time for huge growth and innovation in tech, and that takes money. However, he says ¡°when we start seeing Super Bowl commercials for texting apps, we¡¯ll know we¡¯re in a bubble.¡±

So, stay on the small screens, and we should be OK. As long as those millions and millions of people keep texting and buying.
