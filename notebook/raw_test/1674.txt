Alta Bicycle Share, the company contracted to run Portland¡¯s much-delayed $4 million bike-sharing system, has responded to a report that its New York City network is going broke by saying it is seeking help from investors.

Without directly addressing the Wall Street Journal story, in which sources partially blame Alta for the 10-month-old Citi Bike system¡¯s financial woes, the Portland-based company explained that it has ¡°grown tremendously¡± over the past four years.

¡°We are seeking outside investors to help continue to accelerate the growth of our company as we continue to improve service for our existing clients and expand our existing systems,¡± Alta¡¯s e-mail statement said.

It's unclear if the company is seeking financial support for just Citi Bike or its entire bike-sharing division.



The company, run by former city of Portland bike planner Mia Birk, also said bike sharing in U.S. cities and around the world remains strong. Alta already runs eight bike-sharing programs in the U.S. and Australia.



¡°Bike share systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco are growing and expanding, with more users and more trips every year,¡± the company said.

However, the Wall Street Journal paints a troubling picture of Citi Bike frantically trying to raise tens of millions of dollars ¡°to rescue the popular bike-share program as it loses money.¡±

The story says that Citi Bike ¡°has been forced to contend with a number of costly issues.¡± Among them: superstorm Sandy beating up equipment, software bugs and a rough winter that discouraged ridership.

At the same time, advocates told the Journal that Alta hadn't done enough to improve the system and has basically ignored problems as they popped up. The story cites Alta's failure to get the bikes where they need to be, problems loading new batteries into charging stations and layoffs hampering customer service.

Alta's bike-sharing system in Portland would have 75 stations with 750 bikes, mostly in Portland¡¯s central city. 



One thing that should give Portland officials pause: Tourists aren't using Citi Bike as much as New York City had hoped. And when they do, many reportedly can't even use their credit cards with the high-tech sharing stations.

An analysis by The Oregonian earlier this month showed Portland is counting heavily on tourists to keep the local bike-sharing system afloat when it launches.

The Portland Bureau of Transportation has not responded to The Oregonian¡¯s request for comment. 



However, in a text message, Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees the bureau, said Portland is being deliberate about starting bike sharing. One reason is "that it gives us a chance to learn from other cities, so we'll see what we can learn from what's happening in New York," Novick said. 



"Part of the problem in New York was the software, and we are using different software that has gotten good reviews from the other cities that have it," Novick said. "I talked to Mia (Birk) and asked her about the tourist issue, and she doesn't think it's true that tourist usage in NYC has been way lower than expected; I asked her for numbers and she said she'd get them to me."

Earlier this month, a messy bankruptcy involving an equipment supplier prompted Portland to once again delay launching the system in Alta¡¯s hometown until 2015.

Alta made only a passing reference to Citi Bike¡¯s financial problems. Instead, the company¡¯s statement to The Oregonian focused primarily on the system¡¯s popularity and growth:

¡°New York's Citi Bike has proven particularly successful. (Seven hundred) people joined in the last week alone, even with near freezing temperatures in New York. Citi Bike currently has over 99,000 Annual Members and average daily ridership of over 36,000 trips per day during the summer and fall. We look forward to working with our partners at the City of New York to ensure the program to continues to be a success, and to expand this convenient, healthy and fun form of transportation for all New Yorkers.¡±

It requested that future questions be directed to the New York City Department of Transportation.

On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Alta shouldn't count on the nation's largest city to pour money into Citi Bike.

Unlike Portland, which is depending on government grant funding to cover half of its bike-sharing project's startup costs, New York was able to get Citi Bike up and running with corporate sponsorships from CitiBank and MasterCard.

Meanwhile, David Bragdon, the former Metro Council president who now works as an executive director of Transit Center, Inc. in New York, took to Twitter to defend bike-sharing, pointing out that the nation¡¯s highway fund is about to go belly up.

According to a New York City bicyclist and bike shop worker named ¡°Matthew,¡± who sent an email to The Oregonian on Friday morning, Portland bicycle businesses should also be concerned about Alta setting up its rental kiosks. 



He asked that his last name not be published.



His email also pointed out what he saw as problems with Alta¡¯s public relations:

It's rarely mentioned, but the effect on bike shops is nearly catastrophic. Most bike shops rely on repairs as their most profitable source of income. And the bike share has cut into that dramatically. I'm an avid cyclist from the NW, living in NYC, and I'm surprised they're doing so poorly. It has been a long winter but regularly I ride by these stations and there isn't a bike there. How can they be losing money? Didn't the city give them the space to park? If so, how bloated is the hierarchy? I've only commented on two news stories ever. Both bike share in NYC. And previously the NY Times ran an article pre-launch about the program and tips on bike safety. The first thing in the article was a "safety tip" that had an Alta Bike safety coordinator saying, "If a taxi window is down, listen for the receipt printing because it's a clue the door may open." So I called and emailed this crew about how negligent that tip is! Was their any accountability? No! Did they ever once go onto a NYC street and listen for a receipt? If they did, they'd realize how idiotic that tip is. Borderline gross negligence. When was the last time a printing receipt harmed anyone? Never! And with all the different safety checks a cyclist must make, why would you lead a NYTimes article with a tip that doesn't work in actual practice? Because these are a bunch of college educated theorists who are afraid to get their hands dirty and understand what truly works and what doesn't. Instead they have theories and bar graphs and pie charts that include listening for printing receipts. They are lucky no one has died trying to hear a receipt only to be hit by a vehicle. And it's sad that these people stay employed. If it was the private sector they'd be broke. Instead they are in some swank office answering emails and seeing how much social media traction they have. Meanwhile, their bike wheels spin aimlessly.
