Starbucks' new mobile app will allow customers to tip baristas directly from their iPhones as of 19 March.

¡°With more than 11 per cent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we¡¯re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,¡± said Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer for Starbucks in a statement.¡±

The new app, which continues to allow direct payment from a customer's phone, will be released in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, with the options to leave a tip only available at around 7000 company-operated Starbucks stores in the United States.

The company said that digital tipping has been a top suggestion on MyStarbucksIdea.com, an online company forum. Starbucks expects to introduce a complete update to the Starbucks App for Android, including a digital tipping feature, later this year.

The phone also allows mobile payment, including Shake to Pay. Through this system, customers can bring the barcode of their Starbucks Card front and center at any time, simply by shaking their mobile device.

Other features includes My Starbucks Rewards status, a reload option via credit card, store locator, Starbucks Card eGift and more.
