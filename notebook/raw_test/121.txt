The Securities and Exchange Commission is adding to the scrutiny of Herbalife, the nutritional supplements company that has been a favorite target of prominent hedge fund short-sellers.

The agency¡¯s enforcement unit has opened an investigation into the company, according to a person briefed on the matter. The inquiry, which is being run out the S.E.C.¡¯s New York office, is likely to examine the company¡¯s sales practices. Herbalife operates through a network of independent resellers who are incentivized to recruit others.

The agency has not decided whether to take action, and Herbalife has not been accused of any wrongdoing. A spokeswoman for Herbalife was not immediately available for comment. The news of the inquiry was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

The inquiry by the agency follows questions about the company¡¯s sales structure.

Late last year, William A. Ackman, the head of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, disclosed an enormous bet against Herbalife, calling it ¡°the best-managed pyramid scheme in the history of the world.¡± In part, the hedge fund manager argued that the product¡¯s suggested retail price was ¡°an artificial, inflated number,¡± and that recruitment was a crucial money maker for salespeople. Mr. Ackman is betting hundreds of millions of dollars that Herbalife shares are worth nothing.

Mr. Ackman is now squaring off against Daniel S. Loeb.

On Wednesday, Mr. Loeb, the head of Third Point Management, disclosed that his firm had bought more than 8 percent of Herbalife, betting that shares in the company would rise. He contends that Mr. Ackman¡¯s thesis is ¡°preposterous.¡± He defends the company, citing its revenue, profit, earnings per share and free cash flow.

¡°While the short seller¡¯s presentation was lengthy,¡± wrote Mr. Loeb in a letter on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Ackman, ¡°it presented no evidence to show that Herbalife has crossed a line that would compel regulators to shut it down.¡±
