Kimberly-Clark Could Hold the May-June Lows but I'm Not Rushing In

In this daily bar chart of KMB, below, we can see that prices have declined to trigger a number of sell signals this month. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has continued to move lower from mid-August and tells me that sellers of KMB have been more aggressive. In this weekly bar chart of KMB, below, we can see that prices are back below the declining 40-week moving average line.
