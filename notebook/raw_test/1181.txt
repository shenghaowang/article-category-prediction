Unemployment rates fell in 43 states and the District of Columbia in January, reflecting a drop in the national jobless rate despite bad weather that may have held down job gains.

Unemployment rose in just one state, Iowa, and was unchanged in six states.

The jobless rate fell significantly in 19 states, with the biggest declines in Louisiana, Michigan and Tennessee. Louisiana's slid to 4.9% from 5.4%; Michigan's, to 7.8% from 8.3%; and Tennessee's, to 7.2% from 7.7%.

Unemployment also dropped sharply in Indiana, to 6.4% from 6.8%. And it continued to fall dramatically in Nevada, to 8.7% from 9%, where unemployment was 10.5% in January 2013.

In Iowa, the jobless rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%, though unemployment in the state is still among the lowest in the USA.

The national unemployment rate dipped to 6.6% from 6.7% in January despite a disappointing 129,000 job gains. Some economists say cold and stormy weather was a factor in damping the number of additional jobs, which is derived from a separate survey of employers than the jobless rate, which comes from a survey of households.

Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate in January, at 9.2%. North Dakota, which is riding an oil boom, continued to have the lowest, 2.6%.
