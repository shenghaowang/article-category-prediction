A charity worker suspects he has been given a fake new 1 coin - despite claims it is near-impossible to copy.

The new 12-sided piece only came into circulation last month with the Royal Mint proudly announcing it was "forgery proof" and the world's most secure coin.

But a 48-year-old man, who has asked not wish to be named, is convinced he has already stumbled across a counterfeit version.

He says the fake, stamped 2016, came in change from a Co-Op in Addlestone, Surrey and has subtle but significant differences to the real thing.

It is heavier, the Queen's head is more to the left, the edge is more rounded, it doesn't have a hologram and there is no detail on the head of the thistle.

'The coin is completely different...there's no detail'

The new coin is meant to feature a hologram at the bottom which shows a  symbol and the number one depending on the light.

There is also a secret high-security feature built into the coin designed to protect it from counterfeiting.

Hundreds of "trial piece" coins were given to retailers to help calibrate or upgrade coin-handling equipment ahead of the real coin's introduction on March 28.

They are not legal tender and cannot be used in shops - although they are fetching decent prices on eBay.co.uk.

The man said the coin was actually given to his partner last Friday when she went to the Co-op to buy a three-line Euromillions lottery ticket which cost 7.50.

She paid with a 20 note and was given 12.50 change - two pound coins, a 50p and 10 note.

The man said: "She came home and put the ticket and change on the bed. Later we ordered a kebab which cost 16 and had it delivered.

"I always give a tip so I went to pick up the change from the bedside table.

"I have a bedside lamp which casts a different shade to the main light and as the coin passed underneath it in my hands one of the coins looked a different.

"I started looking at it more closely and paid the delivery man with another pound coin I had on me.

"I then compared it against three of the normal pound coins and realised it was completely different. It has a different thickness and is a different colour.

"The coin is completely different and is more rounded around the edge.

"There is clearly space between the engraving lines, it's a different size, the Queen's head is to the left, and there is no detail of the head of the thistle - it's just a blob.

"The stem of the coin has got no detail on it, there are a lot of things wrong with it."

He added: "If I've just found one, how many are there in circulation already? It's quite worrying. It's supposed to be the impossible coin."

The new pounds were introduced amid reports that as many as one in every 30 old pound coins were counterfeit.

The man is keeping the coin for the time being and has got it securely stowed in zipup pocket in his Nike bag.

In a statement, the Royal Mint told Mirror Money that it's unlikely the coin is counterfeit, however could not guarantee this without examining the coin first.

A spokeswoman said: "The Royal Mint has not had an opportunity to examine the coin, but is confident that this is not counterfeit. We are not aware of any counterfeits entering circulation but welcome the public¡¯s caution.

"The organisation produces around five billion coins each year, and will be striking 1.5bn new 1 coins in total.

"As you would expect, we have tight quality controls in place, however variances will always occur in a small number of coins, particularly in the striking process, due to the high volumes and speed of production.

A statement on the New Pound Coin website said "Approximately one in thirty 1 coins in circulation is a counterfeit".

"The current 1 coin is being replaced for the first time in over thirty years because of its vulnerability to sophisticated counterfeiters.

"The coin features a "hidden high security feature - built into the coin to protect it from counterfeiting in the future."

Fake round 1 coins - how to spot them

It is believed that around 30 million fake round pounds are currently in circulation, - an estimated 2.55% of all those in use. These are the Royal Mint's tips on how to spot a counterfeit version:
 None The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here .
 None The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.
 None The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.
 None Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.
 None The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.
 None The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.
