posted stronger-than-expected third quarter earnings Monday and said long-time CEO Thomas Falk would step down next year to make way for President and COO Mike Hsu. Kimberly-Clark said adjusted earning for the three months ending in September came in at $1.71 per share, topping the consensus forecast of $1.63 per share and rising 7% from the same period last years. The group held its full-year earnings forecast of $6.6 to $6.80 per share unchanged, an estimate which sits at the upper-end of the Street's forecast, and announced that Falk would become executive chairman as Hsu transitions to the CEO role on January 1.
