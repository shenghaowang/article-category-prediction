Indiana had the largest gains in manufacturing employment in January, according to the latest statewide data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Indiana added 4,600 net new workers, using seasonally adjusted data. Other states with the most manufacturing hiring in January were Missouri (up 2,500), Ohio (up 2,400), Minnesota (up 2,000), and New York (up 1,900).

Michigan added the most manufacturing workers over the past 13 months (up 18,100), assisted by strength in the recovering auto sector. Other states with the most net manufacturing job growth since the end of 2012 included Indiana (up 14,500), Ohio (up 10,000), Florida (up 10,000), and Wisconsin.

North Dakota continues to have the lowest unemployment rate in the country (2.6 percent), followed by Nebraska (3.5 percent), South Dakota (3.6 percent), and Utah (3.9 percent). North Dakota¡¯s low unemployment rate is the result of the explosive growth in shale exploration in that state in recent years. Meanwhile, Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate in January at 9.2 percent, with Illinois and Nevada close behind at 8.7 percent each.

February sate employment numbers will be released on March 28.
