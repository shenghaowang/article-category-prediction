-- economy pulled off a welcome January jobs surprise, posting a jobless rate that bettered the U.S. average and amounted to the biggest one-month drop in two decades.

And it happened despite record cold and snow that usually sound the death knell for new hiring.

The new seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4 percent for January is the lowest since . The 0.4 percentage point drop since December equals the November-to-December drop and adds to reputation as one of the nation's top job-creating states.

In manufacturing, ranks first in the nation for jobs added in January (4,500) and second in jobs added over the past year (13,800), said , a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Workforce Development.

"Every Hoosier should be encouraged by today's unemployment numbers, which show the largest one-month drop in unemployment in 20 years," he said in a statement Monday. " rate is now lower than the national average, and our labor force and population continue to grow."

Indiana House Democratic Leader saw less to like. He pointed to the 209,305 Hoosiers who remained without work in January and noted that 82 of 92 counties saw unemployment rates rise from December to January.

"We may talk about unemployment percentages going down, but they are not going down as much as the continued 10-year decline in the household incomes of Hoosiers," Pelath said in a statement.

An economist for in , , said falling unemployment rate isn't a "hollow" number that masks structural problems in the job market. He said the state's manufacturing employment -- which pays higher-than-average wages and tends to offer better benefits than other sectors -- is bouncing back faster than the nation since the 2007-09 recession. The result is more jobs being created in the retail and professional service sectors.

Rankin cautioned that labor force participation rate of 62.6 percent -- which shows the percentage of people actually working -- remains about 2 percentage points below the nation's rate. That represents about 65,000 workers younger than 65 who have dropped out of the labor force or taken jobs in the shadow economy and aren't counted as unemployed.

If they elect to return to the labor force in large numbers, jobless rate could jump again, Rankin said.

About 2,700 of those nonworking Hoosiers did return to the labor force in January, but it wasn't enough to push the jobless rate up.

January's winter weather woes didn't leave the job market entirely unscathed. The state shed 7,100 private-sector jobs that month, mainly because the severe weather reduced retail spending and dampened economic activity in other ways, said workforce development officials.

Even so, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in January were nearly 6,000 below levels.

The rate of unemployment in remains below all neighboring states and is lower than the national rate by 0.2 percentage points, according to workforce development numbers. The last time rate was lower than the national rate was .

January unemployment also fell in neighbor states. It stood at 6.9 percent in , 7.7 percent in , 7.8 percent in and 8.7 percent in .

Pence acknowledged that economy isn't a picture of overall good health.

"We know that unemployment numbers are not a complete measure of the health of the economy," he said in the statement. "Too many Hoosiers are still struggling, which is why we need to continue pushing to improve economic climate, to attract more jobs and to make sure Hoosier workers have the skills they need for the jobs of the future.
