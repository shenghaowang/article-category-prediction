Renting out that room to travelers isn't a billion dollar idea.

Airbnb, the web-based "home rental marketplace," is in fundraising talks with captains of capital, which could lead to a $10 billion valuation of the company, the Wall Street Journal first reported.

That would be a value higher than "real" hotels. Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Wyndham Worldwide are worth $8.43 billion and $9.39 billion respectively, Reuters reported.

TPG Capital Management LP is one of the private equity firms in fundraising talks with the San Francisco-based tech giant, Reuters reported.

TPG also invested a large sum in Uber, another tech darling of the so-called "sharing economy."

Airbnb continues to be popular despite scrutiny from governments in New York State and in San Francisco, where its legality is questioned, the news source reported.
