Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) on Tuesday announced that it will launch a used video game exchange program. Customers will be able to trade in old video games in exchange for store credit beginning on March 26.

Wal-Mart's move into the used game space places tremendous pressure on GameStop (NYSE: GME) whose trade-in program is the company's bread and butter. GameStop holds a dominant position in the nearly $2 billion pre-owned video game market, which consists of an estimated 110 million people across the United States.

GameStop reported that its pre-owned sales rose seven percent to $567 million during the 2013 holiday season. The pre-owned category is expected to yield a 46 percent to 49 percent gross margin rate for the company.

¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They'll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want,¡± Wal-Mart said in a statement on Tuesday morning.

Wal-Mart was already active in the tablet and smartphone trade-in program and is ¡°actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity¡± by offering consumers the ability to purchase any item in its store and not limit consumers to purchasing a new game.

If gamers are interested in trading in used games for clothes or other Wal-Mart products, GameStop could feel some pressure.

Colin Sebastian, analyst at Baird isn't concerned. The analyst sees the news as being a ¡°headline risk¡± for GameStop that will pressure shares, but aside from that Wal-Mart is unlikely to capture meaningful share of the used game market.

Sebastian noted that other names such as Best Buy and Amazon.com have previously toyed with a pre-owned game exchange program and has only seen ¡°modest success.¡±

In fact, Wal-Mart was previously active in the pre-owned game market and introduced kiosks in 2009 that customers could use to trade in their old games. The program failed and was discontinued in 2010.
