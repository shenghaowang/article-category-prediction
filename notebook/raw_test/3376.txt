Twitter must appoint a legal representative in Turkey and block a number of individual accounts if the ongoing ban on the social media site is to end, the country's industry minister Fikri Isik has said.

Despite the block imposed yesterday, protesters have found ways to rail against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan via the service.

Mr Erdogan vowed to "wipe out" Twitter in Turkey after alleged evidence of government corruption began to spread online.
