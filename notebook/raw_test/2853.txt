Mega retailer Walmart is jumping into the used video game business, the company announced today.

Starting later this month, gamers will be able to trade in their games at Walmart and receive store credit that can be spent on anything sold at either Walmart or Sam's Club. Purchases can be made using the credit either in-store or online.

Walmart, naturally, will then resell the pre-owned games (after having them refurbished) back to consumers in a fashion presumably similar to how GameStop and Best Buy handle it now.

What do you make of this news? With the rise in popularity of digital media, might Walmart be jumping into the market a bit too late?
