SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) ¡ª Security software developer Symantec Corp. gave the boot to Chief Executive Steve Bennett as the company¡¯s turnaround appears to be taking longer than expected.

In a statement earlier on Thursday, Symantec did not offer much of an explanation.

¡°We recognize Steve¡¯s contributions to Symantec,¡± board chairman Daniel Schulman said. ¡°We remain committed to our previously announced greater-than 5% organic revenue growth and better-than 30% non-GAAP operating margin targets by FY17.¡± He added that the decision ¡°was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.¡±

Two and a half weeks ago, Bennett, who was appointed CEO in July 2012, told a Morgan Stanley Technology Conference that he planned to tell the board at an upcoming retreat that the company¡¯s turnaround targets were still ¡°very doable.¡± Perhaps the board thinks Symantec SYMC, -1.50% should be hitting its targets sooner.

¡°We¡¯re going to have a tough year on margin expansion next year and revenue growth just [because of] the economics of the model, but we¡¯re very excited about 2016 and 2017,¡± Bennett said earlier this month. He will be replaced on an interim basis by board member Michael Brown.

The developer of such products as Norton Antivirus software has been hit hard by the PC market¡¯s steady decline. It has also struggled with a shift in the software industry to software as a service, or to a subscription model, versus the one-time licensing cost. Symantec will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results May 7.

Bennett had told the Morgan Stanley conference that the only way the company could meet the current profit margin target was through more cost cuts. ¡°We took out about $200 million this year. I¡¯m not going to do that again next year.¡±

Sounds like there might have been some disagreement about strategy or his approach to the turnaround. But will another CEO be able to move any faster without making more big cuts as well?

Investors were not pleased with the news, driving Symantec¡¯s shares down over 6%.
