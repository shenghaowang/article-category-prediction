Luxury fashion brand Mulberry has today announced the appointment of Bruno Guillon as its new CEO, taking over from current CEO and Chairman Godfrey Davis.

Guillon has considerable experience in designer fashion and has been Managing Director of Herm¡§s France for the last four years, following successful stints at LVMH and Nina Ricci.

Joining the company with effect from March 1st 2012, Guillon will take on his new role after a three-month handover from Davis, who will continue as Non-Executive Chairman.

Davis explained that the handover period is in place to ensure a smooth takeover and said he was delighted that Guillon will be joining the team.

¡°We have planned our management succession carefully and have been actively searching for the right candidate since the beginning of this year,¡± he added.

¡°Bruno brings with him a wealth of luxury goods experience and an ability to drive our ambitious plans for international growth.¡±

Earlier this month, the company released a half-year report revealing that total revenues in the six months ending September 30th 2011 were up 62 per cent year-on-year to 72.3 million, while like-for-like retail sales rose 44 per cent compared to the same period in 2010.

International expansion remains a key objective for the flourishing brand and Guillon will work closely with Creative Director Emma Hill to achieve this goal. Hill believes that her new colleague will bring an instinctive understanding of quality and an invaluable international perspective to the role.

Commenting on his appointment, Guillon expressed excitement at continuing the dynamic success achieved by the group in recent times.

He added: ¡°It is a great English brand with a unique heritage and an exceptional opportunity for growth. I look forward to working with Godfrey, the board of directors, Emma and the very talented management team.¡±
