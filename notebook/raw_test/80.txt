Starbucks has updated its mobile app for iOS to add the ability for customers to tip their baristas directly from the app. Tips can be given digitally in the following denominations: $0.50, $1.00, and $2.00.

The update will start rolling out on March 19 for Starbucks App users in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. The update will not only bring the new barista tipping feature, but it will also, according to the announcement, improve the overall experience of the app. Easier access to a user¡¯s account details along with their My Starbucks Rewards information will be added with the update. In-app Barista tipping will be available at over 7,000 Starbucks branches in the U.S.

¡°With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we¡¯re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,¡± said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks. ¡°This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we¡¯ll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come.¡±

According to MyStarbucksidea.com, one of the company¡¯s online communities, the digital tipping features has been one of the top suggestions in the community. The company has said that it also plans to bring the feature to Android phone users, but they will have to wait until sometime later this year for it.

¡°As more and more customers are using their phone to pay, they have also asked for a convenient and meaningful way to show their appreciation to store partners,¡± said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S., Americas, and Teavana. ¡°We¡¯re proud to offer digital tipping as an option through the updated Starbucks for iPhone app for customers in the U.S.¡±

Along with the digital tipping feature, the Starbucks app already has a slew of features available for the customer¡¯s use, including the Mobile Payment feature, Shake to Pay, automatic reloading via mobile device, a Starbucks store locator, and the ability to purchase and send Starbucks Card eGifts.
