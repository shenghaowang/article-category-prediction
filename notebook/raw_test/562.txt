New Jersey's unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in January, according to preliminary data the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released this morning. But the state lost an estimated 3,900 jobs in the process.

The unemployment rate is nearly two points lower than a year ago, the data show. In January 2014, the jobless rate stood at 8.9 percent.

The January rate also is a notch below the revised 7.2 percent rate that New Jersey tallied in December.

But the preliminary data show that the state had 3.9249 million jobs in January. That's just 5,600 more jobs than January of 2013, when the state reported 3.9193 million jobs.

A report from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development out this morning with "benchmarked" revisions to the 2013 data shows that the state gained 18,800 jobs last year, all within the private sector. The public sector shrank by 1,000 jobs last year, the data also show.

That's stronger than earlier estimates. A preliminary report released in January showed New Jersey may have only gained 10,100 jobs last year.
