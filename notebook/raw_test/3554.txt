Sally Beauty Suffers Security Data Breach Of Less Than 25,000 Accounts

Another retailer is letting people know that they too suffered a security breach.

Denton, Texas-based Sally Beauty, one of the largest retailers of professional beauty products in the world, said it found a breach on March 5, which affected less than 25,000 debit and credit card accounts. The company said it was working alongside a forensics firm and the U.S. Secret Service to identify the breach.

The company said it takes this situation quite seriously. They¡¯re working with Verizon about the matter and taking the necessary precautions and actions to deal with the issue the security incident has caused. Sally Beauty said a preliminary investigation was being handled by the Secret Service.

Breaches in personal data have been a real issue for retailers, and has shaken consumer confidence, especially after Target¡¯s significant Thanksgiving security breach. Neiman Marcus and other retailers have said they have also suffered with data breaches during the holiday season. For Target, the breach may have curbed customer traffic.

Sally Beauty has over 2,800 stores around the world including the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. It also provides more than 6,000 professional quality products for skin, nails and hair for salon professionals and retail customers.
