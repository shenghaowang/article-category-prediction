Today's Budget will include at least one money-making scheme for Wales, with the Royal Mint at Llantrisant ready to roll out the replacement for the 1 coin.

The new 1 will have the same 12-sided shape of the ※threepenny piece§ which vanished with decimalisation in 1971.

According to the Royal Mint, about 3% of all 1 coins (or 45 million) are now forgeries. The present 1 has been in circulation for more than three decades 每 much longer than the lifetime of a typical coin 每 and is prey to counterfeiters.

The new ※bi-metallic§ two-colour coin should be introduced in 2017 and will be roughly the same size as the 1 coin, and the Royal Mint 每 which developed the technology at its South Wales base 每 is confident it will be ※the most secure coin in the world§.
