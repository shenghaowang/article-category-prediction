Mortgage rates are in a constant state of flux, but they remain low by historical standards. If you¡¯re in the market for a mortgage, it could be a great time to lock in a rate. Just make sure you shop around first.

The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 4.49 percent, up 8 basis points since the same time last week. A month ago, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was lower, at 4.42 percent.

At the current average rate, you¡¯ll pay principal and interest of $506.09 for every $100,000 you borrow. That¡¯s an increase of $4.74 over what you would have paid last week.

You can use Bankrate¡¯s mortgage calculator to figure out your monthly payments and see what the effects of making extra payments would be. It will also help you calculate how much interest you¡¯ll pay over the life of the loan.

The average 15-year fixed-mortgage rate is 3.89 percent, up 5 basis points from a week ago.

Monthly payments on a 15-year fixed mortgage at that rate will cost around $734 per $100,000 borrowed. That¡¯s obviously much higher than the monthly payment would be on a 30-year mortgage at that rate, but it comes with some big advantages: You¡¯ll come out several thousand dollars ahead over the life of the loan in total interest paid and build equity much faster.

The average rate on a 5/1 ARM is 4.24 percent, climbing 18 basis points over the last 7 days.

These types of loans are best for those who expect to sell or refinance before the first or second adjustment. Rates could be substantially higher when the loan first adjusts, and thereafter.

Monthly payments on a 5/1 ARM at 4.24 percent would cost about $491 for each $100,000 borrowed over the initial five years, but could increase by hundreds of dollars afterward, depending on the loan¡¯s terms.
