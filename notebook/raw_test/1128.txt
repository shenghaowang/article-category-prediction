Trading video games for groceries might sound like an odd concept, but it's one of the many exchanges you'll soon get to make at Walmart. The mega-retailer is now accepting trade-ins on used games at its stores, allowing you to turn your old copies of "Call of Duty" and "Halo" into gift cards to be used online or at any Walmart or Sam's Club location.

The program, launching Mar. 26, will allow shoppers to trade in games "for popular consoles like the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360." Once a game is brought in, Walmart will scan the UPC, check the disk for any damage and provide a trade-in value based on the game's condition.

All used games will be refurbished and sold in "Certified Pre-Owned" condition later this year.

"There are almost a billion video games sitting unused in homes across the United States," said Justin Williamson, director of entertainment for Walmart.

"Our strategy is to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want," he continued in a blog post.

Walmart's new trade-in initiative will debut at more than 3,100 locations throughout the United States. The retailer has yet to list any specific trade-in values for popular games like "Titanfall" and "Dark Souls II," so we'll have to wait and see how Walmart's prices stack up to those of Best Buy and Gamestop.

This isn't Walmart's first foray into the world of exchanging electronics, as the store accepts trade-ins on smartphones, tablets and MP3 players.
