Stocks with low price-earnings ratios, generally under 10 or so, are typically considered to be cheap stocks. Sometimes stocks trade with low valuations because the market has undervalued the company＊s shares. Other times, stocks that appear cheap are actually very expensive.

Knowing the difference can either help an investor make a nice return or cause them to lose a large percentage of their principal. It is not always easy, but it is vitally important that investors know the difference between a mispriced equity and one that should be avoided altogether.

In which of these categories does GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) belong?

In 1984, an educational software company called Babbage＊s was founded. In 1987, Babbage＊s began selling Nintendo games, which would account for two-thirds of all of the company＊s sales by 1991. Barnes and Noble would eventually purchase Babbage＊s in 1999. GameStop, as we know it today, was spun off and listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange starting on Feb. 13, 2002.

 The intrinsic value of GME

Reason No. 1 for owning GameStop 每 more than just a video game store

GameStop operates more than 7,200 stores in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Many consumers likely think that GameStop is mostly a distributor of used video games, but in fact only about 23% of last year＊s $9 billion in revenues came from used video games. GameStop also sells video game hardware, digital video games and collectables.

GameStop owns and publishes Game Informer, a monthly video game magazine that is the fourth most popular magazine by copies circulated. This magazine features articles, strategy tips and previews upcoming game releases. In this way, Game Informer acts as a promotional item to get customers in to the company＊s stores.

GameStop＊s Technology Brands division includes more than 1,300 stores that sell AT&T (T) products and services, such as devices and DirecTV subscriptions, under the name of Spring Mobile AT&T as well as sell Apple products and services, such as laptops and smartphones, under the banner of Simply Mac.

While many think of GameStop simply as a video game store, the company is actually more diversified in its product offerings than most investors probably realize.

Reason No. 2 for owning GameStop 每 the valuation and potential acquisition

GameStop closed Monday＊s trading session at a price of $14.89. Based off of the company＊s earnings per share forecast of $3.025 for the year, the stock trades at a price to earnings multiple of 4.9, well off GameStop＊s five-year average valuation of 10x earnings.

And it is only recently that GameStop has seen the valuation surge higher. It was reported on June 18 that GameStop had been in discussion with private equity firms regarding the possibility of taking the company private. GameStop confirmed this news and the stock soared almost 10% in a single trading session. Prior to this news, the stock had declined more than 30% over the last year. Even after this sharp uptick in price, GameStop＊s stock trades well below its average valuation, making the stock cheap relative to its history.

Reason No. 3 for owning GameStop 每 the dividend

GameStop has only been paying a dividend since 2012. From this time to the present, the dividend has increased at a compound average growth rate, or CAGR, of 11.3%. In addition to this high rate of dividend growth, GameStop＊s yield average annual yield has only been below 3.4% once (2013) since the company started making payments to shareholders. Shares of GameStop have a robust 10% dividend yield currently, but are only expected to consume 50% of 2018＊s expected earnings per share. High yield combined with double-digit dividend growth can be rare.

Reason No. 1 for not owning GameStop 每 earnings trends

While there are some positives with GameStop, there are also some glaring negatives. GameStop reported first quarter earnings on May 31. The company earned 38 cents per share, beating analysts＊ estimates by 1 cent, but declining almost 40% year-over-year. Revenue declined 5.9% to $1.93 billion, missing estimates by $30 million.

Same store sales decreased 5.3%, which was higher than analysts＊ forecasts of a 5% drop. Stores in the U.S. suffered a 2.6% drop with international stores declining 11.6%. The reason for the large declines was in large part the release of the Nintendo Switch in the previous year＊s first quarter. GameStop will always be at the mercy of the timing of game releases and their popularity among consumers.

On the plus side, revenue for digital games, which are becoming more and more popular with gamers, was up almost 30% and collectible sales improved 24.4%.

Still, GameStop expects full year sales to decrease between 2-6%. The company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.05. At the midpoint, this would be a decline of 10.2% in earnings per share, the third straight year of lower earnings.

Reason No. 2 for not owning GameStop 每 what happens to the valuation if GameStop remains a public company?

While there has been reported interest from private equity firms looking to remove GameStop from the public markets, there is no certainty that this will occur. While this news, along with a near double-digit pop in share price, is good for grabbing headlines, it is possible that GameStop remains a publicly traded company. If this were to happen, it is very conceivable that the gains from this news are quickly given back.

GameStop is a company that sees sizable declines in earnings and sales for 2018. Both of these issues have been a problem for a while and don＊t appear to be going away anytime soon

Reason No. 3 for not owning GameStop 每 the dividend (paradoxically)

While GameStop＊s dividend yield is very attractive, there are some red flags that investors should be aware of. A company with an increasing level of debt may have to cut the dividend in order to pay back that debt. GameStop＊s debt has almost doubled over the last five years. If this trend were to continue, the company might not be able to fund its dividend.

Another issue that could impact GameStop＊s ability to continue making its dividend payments is a declining revenue stream. Over the last 10 years, same store sales have dropped at CAGR of 1.2%. Over five years, same store sales declined at a CAGR of 1.3%. With even harsher declines forecasted for 2018, the trend in lower revenue is not only continuing -- it is accelerating.

While GameStop＊s dividend only accounts for about half of expected earnings for 2018, this is the company＊s highest payout ratio ever. This could put a cap on dividend increases going forward if this capital is needed elsewhere in the business.

GameStop is certainly cheap from a strictly quantitative perspective. There's no question about that.

Qualitatively, the stock is very risky. Again, this is not a particulalry contrarian opnion. The question is, does GameStop's current absurdly low valuation make up for its risks?

I believe that the answer is yes. GameStop is a high-risk stock. It should not be a core position of any investors portfolio. But the stock does offer compelling total return potential thanks to its extremely low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield.

If GameStop is taken private, and/or if the company stabilizes its results, GameStop shareholders will very likely realize high returns from today's price. Alternatively, there's an elevated chance of business obsolesence at GameStop.
