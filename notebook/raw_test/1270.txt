¡Á No Debris Discovered in Latest Search for Missing Plane

(CNN) ¡ª The location where a Chinese satellite captured images of a large floating object was within Saturday¡¯s search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but searchers did not find anything, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.

Officials will now consider the new Chinese images as it plans its search for Sunday.

Early Saturday morning, China released satellite images showing a large object floating in the southern Indian Ocean and sent ships to verify, the Malaysian transport minister said Saturday.

The object was said to be 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet).

China later said the satellite images showing the ¡°suspected floating object¡± were captured four days ago, on March 18.

The floating object was said to be about 77 miles from where earlier satellite images spotted floating debris.
