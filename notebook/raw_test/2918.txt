With many games now available in digital format we can understand how some gamers may feel Walmart is leaving it a little late in the day to start with the used game trade, but this is bound to be welcome news for those looking for an alternative when it comes to buying second hand games. The used game trade-ins commence next week in select Walmart stores across the US.

This will start from Wednesday the 26th March at 3,100 Walmart and Sam¡¯s Club stores across the States and later down the road we can expect to see pre-owned games on the shelves, although titles traded-in next week for credit will not be accessible for re-sell immediately.

For those looking for additional help when it comes to trading unwanted games the official Walmart website has posted a video tutorial, although games are already available. In an article on Games Industry they discuss Walmart¡¯s introduction to the game trade-in business as the company look to prise some of the action away from leading competitors.

We can probably expect to see the used and traded games available to in-store consumers as early as this summer, as Walmart intends to let the gamer pay less for their titles. This comes from executive vice president Duncan Mac Naughton as he comments about their expectations that will see Walmart pay more for games, while customers pay less.

The company expect to take on all games for all existing console systems and Mac Naughton says ¡°trade-in prices will, of course, vary depending on a title¡¯s popularity,¡± even though he does expect the average price paid per game to be around $35.

Therefore, we can see this becoming even more advantageous for gamers looking to exchange, trade or buy used games.
