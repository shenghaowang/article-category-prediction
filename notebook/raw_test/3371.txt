It's the world's most advanced coin, including holograms, multiple, layered metals and it has 12 sides.

A billion of the new 1 coins will start finding their way into your change from 28 March.

From September, you'll stop getting the old one in your change and by October most people will stop accepting the old round pound coin at all.

But do they work everywhere the old one did? We got one early and decided to find out...

Does the new 1 coin in shopping trolleys?

You need to put a pound into millions of supermarket shopping trolleys to unchain them.

That means it would be a bit embarrassing to get there only to find yourself with a coin wedged in and the trolly not released.

So - Good News! It's worked fine in every trolley we tried it in.

Does the new 1 coin work in vending machines?

You'll be familiar with the drill. Put coin in, coin falls straight through. Take coin out, breathe on it, try again. If that fails, try rubbing it on the side of the machine and try again.

So we were justly nervous when we dropped our shiny new 1 coin into the work vending machine.

But it was good news again - with the coin registering fine. In case you're wondering, we bought a Twix and got 20p change back.

A word of warning though, there are a LOT of vending machines. So it's possible it won't work everywhere.

Will the new 1 coin work in parking meters?

Almost everyone has a stock of 20ps and 1s in their car to pay for parking or toll booths, but will the new coin work there too?

Dave Smith, head of public affairs at the British Parking Association told Mirror Money there are roughly 100,000 parking machines, of which one in ten dispense change. Most of them will be fine.

¡°There is a slight risk that some machines may not accept the new pound coin or [stop accepting] one of the smaller denominations," he warned.

That's because coin-operated machines have a limited number of "hoppers" to hold different coins.

So if you add a new one for the new 1 coin, you might have to lose an excisting one.

¡°The ones that dispense change may be the ones with issues. There is a risk you couldn¡¯t use a 5p or a 10p,¡± Smith explained.

If it helps, the ones we tried worked well.
