Ahead of today's budget, Chancellor George Osborne dipped into his pocket and displayed a new 12-sided 1 coin, the coin's first redesign in 30 years. The reasoning behind this costly move? It's less-easy prey for counterfeiters, supposedly.

While introducing a new coin will cost the country an undisclosed amount to create, Osborne has said that the new design will cut down on fraud, said to cost us millions each year, thanks to its Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) tech. The Royal Mint actually thinks that around 45 million 1 coins, in our pockets and down the backs of sofas, are actually forgeries.

Lest you think Osborne's gone and put his own face on one of the coin sides, the Queen's visage is still on the "head" side of the coin, but it's up to us -- the commoners -- to decide what makes it to the "tails" side.
