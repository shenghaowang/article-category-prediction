Citigroup is among the largest banks to receive a quantitative objection, having fallen just short of the 5% minimum Tier 1 capital requirement in 2012 ¡ª the first year the Fed published CCAR results on individual firms. Citi also received a qualitative objection in 2014 because of challenges projecting revenue and losses in the Fed¡¯s stress scenarios.

Zions is the most recent bank to have received a quantitative objection, having fallen below the 5% Tier 1 capital minimum in 2014, the first year it participated in the full CCAR exercise. The bank also was the most recent to have fallen below the minimum capital level in the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test.

Ally Financial had a rocky start to its stress testing career, having failed CCAR on quantitative grounds in 2012 and 2013, with the bank saying after the 2013 test that it disagreed with the Fed¡¯s assessment of its capital performance under stress. But the bank has built up its capital base since, having clocked in with a 6.6% post-stress minimum in 2014 and 7.1% in 2015.
