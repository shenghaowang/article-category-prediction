Choosing the type of loan that best fits your needs doesn't have to be complicated, as long as you provide your lender with all the most accurate and necessary financial information.

Before deciding what type of loan you want, think about your future.

- Will you be in the home for a long time? A loan with a lower monthly payment and a low, fixed interest rate may be the best for you.

- Do you want to have your home paid off before your children enter college or before you retire? Then a shorter term loan may be in your best interest but expect to have higher monthly payments.

With whatever type of loan you are thinking about, your lender can help you figure out what your monthly payments will be with a mortgage calculator.

Conventional loans: These are 5- to 50-year (although most are 15- and 30-year mortgages) fixed rate or Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) loans that require three to 20-percent of the purchase price as a down payment. These loans aren't backed by the U.S. government. Closing costs are paid for by the buyer or seller, depending on what is negotiated in the real estate contract.

These loans also require (PMI) if you can't pay 20-percent of the purchase price upfront. The PMI allows the lender to be insured if the borrower defaults on the loan. The PMI payments are rolled into the monthly loan payment and you can request that it be discontinued once you have made the necessary payments to reduce the principal balance of your mortgage to 80- percent of the original value of your home and have made timely payments.

(FHA)/ (HUD) loans: These loans are provided by private lenders but backed by the U.S. government and require Mortgage Insurance Premiums. Similar to conventional loans, you are required to pay mortgage insurance premiums however FHA loans require an upfront premium collected at closing as well as a monthly premium for the life of the loan. If you default on your loan, the FHA reimburses the lender.

Your down payment on an FHA home can be as low as 3.5-percent of the purchase price, and most of your closing costs and fees can be included in the loan. FHA has a loan that allows you to buy a home, fix it up, and include all the costs in one loan.

People who can't obtain a conventional loan often can receive an FHA loan because of weak credit or the inability to make a down payment.

The adjusted income must not exceed 115% of the median household income for the area the home is located. Qualifying ratios and the applicant's stable and dependable income will determine home affordability.

No down payment for a loan is required and there is no maximum purchase price for the home. Fixed 30-year interest rates may apply to this kind of loan. Lenders and applicants agree upon the interest rate. Eligible closing costs and lender fees may be included in the loan or paid by the applicant. Eligible repairs and improvements may also be included in the loan.
