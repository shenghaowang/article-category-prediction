It's claimed the new 12-sided design will make the coins the most secure in the world.

The Government has announced a new 1 coin design, which it claims will make it the most secure coin in the world.

The new 1 will have the same 12-sided shape as the old three pence piece, or ¡®threepenny bit¡¯. It will be roughly the same size as the current 1 coin.

It will also have what¡¯s known as a bi-metallic construction in two colours and include the Royal Mint¡¯s new Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS), which allows coins to be authenticated easily.

It will have the Queen¡¯s head on the ¡®heads¡¯ side and there will be a public competition to decide on the design for the reverse (or ¡®tails¡¯ if you prefer) side.

The current 1 coin has been in circulation for over 30 years, which is far longer than the lifecycle of a modern British coin.

The Royal Mint estimates that around 3% of all 1 coins are now forgeries, with the figure as high as 5% in some areas. It says around two million fakes are taken out of circulation each year.

The Government is to start a consultation on the new coin, in particular gauging its likely impact on business.
