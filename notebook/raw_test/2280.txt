July 25 (Reuters) - Symantec Corp unexpectedly replaced its chief executive, naming current chairman and former Intuit Corp CEO Steve Bennett to run the world¡¯s biggest maker of security software.

The company said in a statement on Wednesday that Enrique Salem stepped down, effective immediately, ending a three-year term during which he and the company had been criticized by Wall Street analysts and investors for a string of financial disappointments.

¡°It was in the board¡¯s judgment that it was in the best interests of Symantec to make a change in the CEO,¡± Bennett said in a statement. ¡°My view is that Symantec¡¯s assets are strong and yet the company is underperforming against the opportunity.¡±

The company had not disclosed that it was considering replacing Salem.
