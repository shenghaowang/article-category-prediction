As well as today¡¯s announcement about the new 12-sided 1 coin, George Osborne announced on Sunday that he would be giving support to the house-building sector by extending the Help to Buy equity loan scheme to 2020 and providing a further 6bn investment to help 120,000 more households purchase a new-build home.

He also announced plans to invest 200m in developing 15,000 new homes around the high speed rail station at Ebbsfleet in Kent. The new ¡°garden city¡± will be built on brownfield land that includes old industrial sites and a former quarry.

The third measure is the new tax-free childcare package which will see the government provide 20% support on childcare costs up to 10,000 a year for each child under the age of 12 from autumn 2015.

Tax-free Childcare will not depend on employers offering it (unlike Employer Supported Childcare vouchers). As well as providing support for the self-employed, the Treasury has adjusted the scheme to ensure that those working part time or earning 50 a week and above, people on maternity, paternity or adoption leave, and those setting up in business who may not meet the minimum earning requirement, are included for the first time.

As far as the new 1 coin is concerned, the Treasury has decided that after 30 years, its technology is no longer suitable for a coin of its value, leaving it vulnerable to ever more sophisticated counterfeiters.

As a result, the government is launching an extensive consultation on the new coin which will focus on the impacts on business ¨C estimated to be around 20m.

As with all UK coins, the Queen¡¯s effigy will be on the ¡°heads¡± side, but the Treasury has announced a public competition to decide the design for the reverse, or ¡°tails¡± side, of the coin.
