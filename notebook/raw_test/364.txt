NEW DELHI: Infosys ADR fell over 6% to end at $56.01 on the US bourses after the company said its sales growth in FY14 will be near the lower end of its guidance.Compared to this, US stocks finished mostly higher after a weak start. It was a late rise that saved the market from its third straight day of losses.The push was enough to nudge the Standard & Poor's 500 index into the green by half a point on Wednesday, as investors bought oil refiners, mining companies and technology stocks. Refiners such as Tesoro led the gains.Stocks were down for most of the day, but began to crawl back in the afternoon. The S&P 500 index added 0.57 points, or 0.03 percent, to close at 1,868.20. The Nasdaq composite also rebounded. It gained 16.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,323.33. Only the Dow Jones industrial average ended lower. It fell 11.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,340.08.The three major US stock indexes are still down for the week. Investors have been worried about a sharp drop in China's exports reported over the weekend, which raised concerns that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

"They need to adjust the gains and then wait for the next catalyst to move higher."
