Sally Beauty Holdings Inc., a seller of hair and beauty products, said data from fewer than 25,000 customers¡¯ payment cards was illegally accessed and may have been stolen.

The U.S. Secret Service and Verizon Communications Inc. are helping investigate the incident, the Denton, Texas-based company said today in a statement. Sally also said it is working to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by the breach.

U.S. retailers including Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus Marcus Group Ltd. are working to recover from hacker attacks that exposed the data of tens of millions of customers during the holiday season. Sally said earlier this month that it had recently detected an attempted intrusion and that it didn¡¯t have any reason to believe credit-card or consumer data had been lost.

Sally rose 0.3 percent to $27.55 at 10:49 a.m. in New York. The shares slid 9.2 percent this year through March 14, the most recent trading day, compared with a 0.4 percent drop for the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index.
