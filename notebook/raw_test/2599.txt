He's doesn't know how to present a defense. He won't negotiate to avoid a trial and inflates costs to the client. He doesn't disclose what's required, nor does he prepare and share questions or documents in advance of litigating. He leaves you in the dark until it's too late. He's untruthful about being prepared for trial and won't disclose what evidence he did or didn't provide the Court until it's too late. After 24 months, dozens of inflated billed hours, and over 100 exhibits he only presented 4 to the court without disclosing this in advance. If you're seeking a litigator, he's not it. When he submitted the wrong version of declarations he REFUSED TO CORRECT the RECORD. Any attorney who refuses to correct the record shouldn't be allowed to practice.
