Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, is looking increasingly isolated after being attacked on all sides, including by his oldest ally President Abdullah Gul, after the country imposed a ban on Twitter.

Mr Gul joined millions of Turks who have flouted the blocking of the social media platform since it was imposed on Thursday night, using his Twitter account to tweet out messages that the closure is ¡°unacceptable¡±.

¡°Besides, as I have said many times before, it is technically impossible to close down communication technologies like Twitter entirely. I hope this measure will not last long.¡±

Turkey restricted access to Twitter hours after Mr Erdogan gave a fiery speech in which he vowed to ¡°root out Twitter¡±.

Mr Erdogan is ensnared in a corruption scandal, which he says is orchestrated by his ¡°enemies¡±, who he claims are using social media to wage the battle.

The social platform had become a fertile ground for sharing links to leaked recordings that purport to capture corrupt deals being made by members of his administration and even his by own son.

¡°Twitter, schmitter!¡± Erdogan had defiantly told his supporters at a rally in the northwestern province of Bursa on Thursday. ¡°I don¡¯t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.¡±

Turkey¡¯s telecommunications regulator (TIB) said that the ban was issued to protect the rights of Turkish citizens since Twitter had ignored orders issued by the country¡¯s courts to block some specific accounts.

Twitter hired Gnen G¨¹rkaynak, a lawyer in Ankara to settle the matter with TIB.

The social platform also tweeted instructions to users in Turkey on how to circumvent the closure by using text messaging services in Turkish and English.

Some major Turkish newspapers published step-by-step instructions of how to get around the shutdown by using virtual private networks (VPN). Citizens also played their part, using internet sites and even graffiti on walls in Istanbul to spread the instructions.

Turkey is the within the top ten users of Twitter worldwide. Within 12 hours of the ban the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey had been used more than half a million times, mostly by users in Turkey itself. Others, including #OccupyTwitter and #ErdoganBlocksTwitter, were also trending.

The European Union said it was worried about the move, with Neelie Kroes, the vice president of the European Commission described the blocking of the site as ¡°groundless, pointless, cowardly.¡±

The United States embassy in Ankara also took to Twitter to reiterate statements made by President Obama on the importance of free speech.

But it was the dissent at home that will be of most immediate concern to the prime minister.

Mr Erdogan was shaken last June by anti-government protests, but prime minister¡¯s reactions to the corruption probe have produced the most serious challenge to his rule.

His speeches have been dominated by angry ¨C and sometimes conspiratorial ¨C claims that resemble more those of an autocrat than elected prime minister who was until recently heralded as Turkey¡¯s moderniser. Social media is the latest culprit, after ¡°foreign powers¡±, ¡°terrorism¡± and an illusive ¡°interest rate lobby¡±.

lhan Cihaner, the deputy parliamentary leader for the opposition Republican People¡¯s Party (CHP) told the Telegraph he believed the ban came as a direct result of Mr Erdogan¡¯s speech.

¡°There is a very serious attack against the people¡¯s freedoms of expression, receiving information and expressing opinion,¡± he said. ¡°This is openly tyranny, we can even say vandalism.¡±

The open defiance of Mr Gul, one of Mr Erdogan¡¯s most erstwhile allies, is a further blow in the lead up to local elections on 30 March, which are increasingly being viewed as a referendum on Mr Erdogan¡¯s rule.
