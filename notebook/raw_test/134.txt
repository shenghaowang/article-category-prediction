China¡¯s Alibaba, the largest e-commerce business in the world, has revealed plans to float on an American stock market in what could be the biggest initial public share offering of all time.

Analysts reckon that Alibaba could seek to raise up to $15 billion (9bn) through the share sale in a move which could value it at between $150 billion and $200 billion. Details of the float may come as early as April.

At the top end, that would make Alibaba the world¡¯s second most valuable internet company after Google, which is valued at $394 billion. Amazon and Facebook both have stock market values of $172bn.

Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma and 17 friends in 1999, when it offered just 22 items on its website. It has grown to dominate Chinese e-commerce and Mr Ma¡¯s wealth is estimated at $11.4 billion. The firm employs more than 20,000 and is said to account for 70 per cent of all packages delivered in China.

The firm has not decided whether to float on the New York Stock Exchange or its more tech-heavy rival Nasdaq, but it has ruled out Hong Kong.

¡°Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,¡± the company said yesterday. ¡°This will make us a more global company and enhance the company¡¯s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.¡±

More than $150 billion-worth of merchandise changes hands on Alibaba¡¯s different online platforms each year, more than Amazon and eBay put together.

The firm has nine major websites, which include consumers selling to consumers, businesses selling to consumers and to each other, global and domestic selling platforms, cloud computing and an electronic payment system.

China is second only to India in the number of internet users it has at 618 million.

McKinsey & Co has forecast its internet retail market will treble in size between 2011 and 2015 to $395 billion.

In its latest figures, for the three months to September 2013, Alibaba¡¯s quarter-on-quarter profits grew by 12 per cent to $792 million on revenues up by 51 per cent at $1.78 billion. In the same quarter Facebook¡¯s profit was $422 million.
