Statue discussions. A place of mystery and mythology for many a young creative across the world, until now. Well now as in a few days ago. This year, for the first time LIA gave all Creative Conversations participants the chance to observe the judging phenomenon. But not without strict instructions. There was to be no Facebooking, no texting, tweeting, bird calls or smoke signals of any kind.So what exactly goes on in these slightly darkened, man caves with an endless selection of beverages? Well a whole lot of work really. In fact, after two days of observing, fly-on-the-wall style, we were all pretty exhausted and we hadn't even moved our lips. The categories I was lucky enough to sit-in on for the final day of judging were production / post-production and integration.
