With the controversy of the Xbox One¡¯s initial DRM policies, many were worried that the used game market would die off in the near future, especially with digital downloads becoming so prominent and more potential options in the future like PlayStation Now. However, another competitor has jumped into the video game trade-in market.

Walmart has announced their own trade-in program akin to those seen at stores like Gamestop, Best Buy, and Target. Walmart¡¯s program will be more similar to the latter two as you can only receive Walmart gift cards, but can do the trades online. The online trader is already up and running so that you can check some of the prices of the games in your collection if you are interested.

The program is set to start on March 26 in stores, but it might not be a good idea to go in right away as the employees may have no idea what you are talking about. I know I experienced this at Target a year after they started a trade-in program, so be prepared. Walmart also revealed that they will be beginning to sell used games this summer after the trade-in program has been in effect for a little while.
