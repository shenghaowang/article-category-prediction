It's been referred to as the greatest reality show on earth and a case of alien abduction, but one outspoken television host suggested the mystery of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 may take a while to solve because it took "2,000 years to find Noah's ark".

Fox News host Bill Hemmer drew his own bizarre parallel between the missing flight and the discovery of Noah's ark in Turkey in 2007 - one of many so-called discoveries discredited as a hoax by scientists.

The news anchor had suggested during an interview with aviation attorney Salvatore Lagonia that the plane may have ended up in Pakistan or the Indian Ocean.

"Well, if I knew, I'd tell somebody," Lagonia responded. "But obviously, it's hard to tell where he [the pilot] went after that. Once he went below 5,000 feet and really tried to stay clear of radar, that plane could make even more turns."

"So, what, it took us 100 years to find the Titanic? It took us 2,000 years to find Noah's Ark. Do we ever find flight 370?" asked Hemmer.

To which Langonia replied: "Oh, I think we find flight 370 much sooner than those two things, thank God. Until then, it's the greatest reality show in the world."

Noah's ark has supposedly been discovered so many times now the scientific community refers to any expeditions to find the resting place of the biblical vessel as "arkeology" and it is widely regarded as pseudoscience.

Former FAA spokesperson Scott Brenner, also speaking on Fox News, said the pilots intended to take the plane in a different direction before they last made contact with air traffic control.

News anchors have been speculating over the demise of the missing plane for the past two weeks. While some have claimed mechanical failure or terrorism as the cause of the disappearance, others have suggested more absurd theories, such as alien abduction.

Earlier this week on CNN, Don Lemmon suggested the missing plane may have been associated with the supernatural.

He said: "Especially today, on a day when we deal with the supernatural. We go to church, the supernatural power of God...people are saying to me, why aren't you talking about the possibility ¡ª and I'm just putting it out there ¡ª that something odd happened to this plane, something beyond our understanding?"

Flight MH370, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, went missing on 8th March. Over the past two weeks, investigators in Malaysia and foreign intelligence agencies have been scrutinising the backgrounds of both the crew and the passengers on the missing jet.

Malaysian officials have said the turned west and according to Malaysian military radar, its last position was over the Malacca Straits - the opposite direction to its flight path.

The FBI has been called into assist attempts to recover data deleted from the flight simulator owned by the plane's chief pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah.

Australian authorities have stated two objects spotted by satellites in the southern Indian Ocean may be debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, fueling hopes of a breakthrough in an international search.

Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport en route to Beijing at 00:41 on Saturday 8 March (16:41 GMT Friday). About 50 minutes later, the aircraft lost contact with air traffic control. On board, there were 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 14 countries. That included 153 Chinese and 38 Malaysians. Two Iranian male passengers, Pouria Nour Mohammad Mahread and Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza, were travelling on fake passports. Neither had any apparent links to terrorist groups. No debris from the plane has been found in the international search. Last confirmed communication with Indian Ocean satellite occurred at 08:11am, meaning plane continued to fly for seven hours after radar signal was lost. At least 25 countries, including China, the US and Singapore, have now joined in the search for the missing plane.
