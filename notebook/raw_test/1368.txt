(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc for a briefing on the price of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which can cost more than $80,000 per patient.

A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee asks for information on Sovaldi discounts on the recently approved medicine to payors and patients.

Sovaldi, seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease, costs about $84,000 per patient.

Gilead shares were down 4 percent in morning trading on Nasdaq. The company did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawmakers' letter.

"Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it," the letter said.

The letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.

"The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance," the letter said. It added, "The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval."

Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.

They are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines. The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated.

New medicines with comparably high cure rates as Sovaldi from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co are expected to gain U.S. approval over the next two years and command similarly high prices.
