Kansas gained about 600 jobs in January, lowering the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent.

There were 1,383,300 non-farm jobs in Kansas in January 2014, according to data released by the Kansas Department of Labor. That was up 600 from December, and up 19,200 from January 2013.

The biggest increases were in construction, which added 2,700 jobs in January, and education and health service, which added 1,600. The gains were largely offset, however, by job losses in government, which cut 1,900 jobs, and by 900 job losses in the financial sector.

Employment in both the nonfarm and farm sectors was up 3,115 from December and 4,651 from January 2013. Unemployment was down 912 compared to December and 12,136 compared to January 2013.

The labor force was up 2,203 compared to December, but down 7,485 compared to January 2013. That indicates people were reentering the labor market and finding jobs in January, but many of those who stopped looking for work in 2013 still haven¡¯t come back into the market.
