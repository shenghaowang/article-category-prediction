U.S. Hits Russian Oligarchs And Officials With Sanctions Over Election Interference

The Trump administration is laying sanctions on 38 Russian oligarchs, government officials and business entities, citing "the Kremlin's malign agenda" that ranges from malicious online campaigns and efforts to undermine democracy to its actions in eastern Ukraine and Syria.

Seven Russian oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control are on the new sanctions list. So are 17 senior Russian government officials, along with a government -owned weapons trading company and its subsidiary bank.

Senior Trump administration officials who delivered a background briefing about the sanctions on Friday morning said they were punishing powerful and connected figures in Russia because of "the totality of the Russian government's ongoing and increasingly brazen pattern" of disruptive actions on an international scale ¡ª most notably, its efforts to subvert democracies.

The move by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control targets members of Russia's elite, including Kirill Shamalov, the husband of Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter, who famously received a loan of more than $1 billion from state-owned Gazprombank.

Shamalov's name has also been indirectly linked to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, through the Paradise Papers ¡ª a trove of financial documents leaked from an offshore law firm that emerged last year.

The Paradise records showed that while Ross had divested himself of many holdings when he took office, he held on to a stake in the shipping company Navigator Holdings through a chain of companies in the Cayman Islands. In turn, Navigator was found to be earning around $20 million annually to ship gas for a Russian company named Sibur ¡ª which is co-owned by Shamalov.

Update: After we published this story, a Department of Commerce spokesman got in touch to say that Ross "has no interest" in Navigator:

"Secretary Ross applauds the strong sanctions being put in place to counter Russian activities against the United States and our interests. As previously reported, he has divested from and has no interest in Navigator Holdings, or in his former firm, or the funds that held these investments. Secretary Ross is committed to the highest ethical standards in service to the American people."

The list also names Oleg Deripaska, a businessman who has been linked to President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. The Treasury says Deripaska has operated on the Russian government's behalf; it also cited "allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group."

Because of the sanctions, assets held by the individuals in the U.S. will be frozen; Americans are also barred from doing business with those named in the list. Foreigners who facilitate large transactions on their behalf could also face sanctions, the U.S. said on Friday.

In announcing the sanctions, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said:

The White House says that it has now sanctioned 189 Russian-related individuals and entities for offenses that range from undermining elections to its dealings with Syria and its actions regarding both Ukraine and North Korea.

Rumors had been swirling that the U.S. was preparing such a move. On Thursday, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was asked whether Russian oligarchs have been in touch with the Kremlin and Putin about increased levels of scrutiny from U.S. agencies.

Peskov replied, "I think the phrase 'Russian oligarchs' is inappropriate."

A better term would be "representatives of big business," Peskov said, according to Tass. And anyway, he added, he had no knowledge of such people raising concerns about American law enforcement.

Here is the Treasury Department's list of those hit by the new sanctions, along with the government's verbatim description (E.O. stands for Executive Order):
