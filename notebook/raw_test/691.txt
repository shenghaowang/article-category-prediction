Australia's unemployment rate has edged up from 5.6 to 5.7 per cent, despite the creation of nearly 40,000 full-time jobs last month.

The Bureau of Statistics survey estimates that 39,300 full-time jobs were created in November, with only 200 part-time jobs lost.

The proportion of people in work or looking for it rose from 64.4 to 64.6 per cent, which explains why the unemployment rate increased even though there was strong job creation last month.

The rise in full-time work also appears to be reflected in a falling underutilisation rate, which measures both the unemployed and the underemployed (those who are not working as many hours as they want).

Underutilisation eased 0.2 percentage points to 14.1, led by a decline in male underutilisation.

However, in seeming contrast to all of these numbers, monthly hours worked dropped slightly.

Overall, Capital Economics analyst Paul Dales said the data indicate a reasonably healthy, and improving, labour market.

"The 39,100 leap in employment in November (consensus forecast +17,500) provides further evidence that the fall in GDP in the third quarter was a blip rather than anything more worrying," he wrote in a note.

However, there was bad news for Western Australia, where unemployment climbed to its highest level in almost 15 years, after hitting 6.9 per cent.

The most recent higher level was 7.1 per cent all the way back in January 2002, during the very early stages of the 21st century mining boom.

Su-Lin Ong from RBA Capital Markets warns that national full-time employment growth is unlikely to maintain the strong pace seen over the past couple of months.

"Given the sluggish pace of domestic demand and a number of challenges ahead, we would not read too much into the jump in employment in November, which will not be sustained," she wrote in a note.

There was also a worrying jump in youth unemployment, which returned to its highest level since July 2015.

This may reflect what JP Morgan's Ben Jarman said is a slowdown in services sector growth, which is where many younger Australians are employed.

"We remain unimpressed with the activity data in recent months and feel there has been a loss of momentum in the services economy as the benefits of earlier Australian dollar depreciation are waning," he wrote in a note.

"As a result, the labour market improvement has also lost some impetus over 2016."
