NEW DELHI | KOLKATA: Sellers on Flipkart are already apprehensive that Walmart will bring its global everyday low pricing business model on general merchandise to the marketplace , indulging in deep discounting, nine large third-party vendors told ET.However, the deal could also give Flipkart an improved supply chain and make it more process-oriented, which will help it to compete with Amazon, some sellers said. The real fight will be in food retailing, where 100% foreign direct investment is allowed and Amazon has government approval to start this business. Although India doesn¡¯t allow online marketplaces such as Flipkart and Amazon to influence prices of products sold on their platforms, sellers have objected to units of these ecommerce companies selling their private labels at discounts.The ¡®Every Day Low Costs, Every Day Low Prices¡¯ offer, which has made Walmart the world¡¯s top retailer, could add to the competitive pressure on smaller online sellers and drive them out of business. They fear getting squeezed between the two giants ¡ª the Walmart-Flipkart combine and Amazon ¡ª even though consumers will benefit.¡°Walmart has global purchase power that gives it a big advantage in terms of costs,¡± said Vishwas Shringi, cofounder at Voylla Retail , a large fashion and lifestyle products seller on online marketplaces including Flipkart.¡°They can come and disrupt the entire market with their ¡®everyday low pricing offer.¡¯ This will definitely put pressure on sellers as they would now compete with Walmart predatory pricing, which is impossible to beat.¡± An electronics seller fears the Walmart-Flipkart deal will once again bring back insanity into discounting, at least in the short run.¡°Deep discounts had become limited to only major sales. But the deal may increase discounting and would also sway Amazon into it. This may happen for at least the first few months since Walmart would want to show its supremacy,¡± said the seller, requesting anonymity.
