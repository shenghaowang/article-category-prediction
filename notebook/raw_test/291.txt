prices ended mixed at Comex on Tuesday, 11 March 2014. Gold prices ended the U.S. day session moderately higher Tuesday, on some more safe-haven demand that surfaced amid the simmering geopolitical situation in Ukraine. Gold futures on Tuesday settled near $1,350 an ounce, scoring a second-consecutive session gain as worries over Ukraine and concerns surrounding a slowdown in Chinese economic growth lifted the metal's safe-haven appeal for investors.

Gold for April delivery rose $5.20, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,346.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier touching a high of $1,353.

May silver shed 9.5 cents, or 0.5%, to $20.815 an ounce after a minor loss in the previous session.

The Ukraine matter is still a worry among traders and investors and has moved closer to the front burner of the market place. The Russian occupation of Crimea is a bullish factor for the safe-haven gold market.

U.S. economic data released Tuesday was on the light side and failed to move the markets. Wholesale inventories increased 0.6% in January after increasing an upwardly revised 0.4% (from 0.3%) in December. The consensus pegged inventory growth at 0.4%. Inventory growth in the durables sector slowed, increasing 0.4% in January after a 1.2% gain in December. Nondurable inventories rose 0.8% in January after falling 0.9% in December. Unfortunately, the strong gain in inventories was likely not planned. Sales, which edged up a slight 0.1% in December, crashed in January and fell 1.9%.

Traders are looking ahead to next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC).
