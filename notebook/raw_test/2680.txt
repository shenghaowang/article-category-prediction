AirBnB has connected millions of users to short term rental properties all over the world. Now the company is aiming for a $10 billion valuation. According to inside sources the company hopes to raise $400 million to $500 million in a new round of funding.

A source at The Wall Street Journal says ¡°people familiar with the process¡± are claiming that private equity firm TPG is leading the round.

Putting that number into perspective, AirBnB would be valued higher than Hyatt Hotels and Wyndham Worldwide. A fitting valuation for a company that has largely disrupted the travel sector with its low cost and accessible fees.

AirBnB has come a long way since its debut in 2008. The company now has more than 600,000 listings worldwide, connecting users to single room, whole house, and even ¡°couch¡± rentals. AirBnb collects a fee for each booking made through its website. For example, my last stay with AirBnB yieled a $79 fee for the company based on a 5-night stay priced at $650.

AirBnB insures each participants property up to $1 million, offering a valuable incentive for anyone willing to join the service. You can read about the company¡¯s insurance policy inside of its Trust Safety Center.

Much like a regular hotel listing, participants list various amenities including internet service, washer/dryer service, and more. The company even offers sections for unique rentals such as Treehouse Homes:

In July 2013 the company was given a $2.5 billion valuation.

As a huge fan of the AirBnB service I can easily understand how a $10 billion valuation can be placed on such a novel idea.

AirBnB has not comment on speculation about its new funding round.
