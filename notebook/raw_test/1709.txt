I am absolutely laughing my head off at the sheer stupidity of bureaucrats who think they can control social media.

 

 Earlier today in response to Turkey Blocks Access to Twitter for National Security Reasons I commented ...

 

 "No one will see the "power" of the Turkish Republic in idea suppression announcements. They will see the arrogance, cowardice, and desperation of prime minister Erdogan."

 

 Twitter Use Breaks New Record

 

 Tonight I am pleased to report Twitter Use Jumps to New High in Turkey

Arrogance, Cowardice, Desperation

 

 So much for the extreme arrogance of Prime minister Erdogan who banned Twitter for "national security" reasons.

 

 Erdogan told an election rally in the western city of Bursa "The international community can say this or that ¨C I don¡¯t care. They will see the power of the Turkish Republic."

 

 Erdogan is a complete fool who is now officially "burnt toast". He is gone except by military force, and even that won't last.

 

 Please tweet this post in the appropriate places, especially my comment (slightly modified) to fit tweet length ...

 No one will see the "Power of the Republic" in Erdogan's announcement. They will see arrogance, cowardice, and desperation.

 

 By the way, if you get the idea things are blowing up all over Europe, it's because they are.
