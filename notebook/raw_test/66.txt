Vodafone has hailed the opening of a new chapter in its history after agreeing a 6bn deal for Spanish cable operator Ono, the first since the sale of its $130bn (78bn) US operations.

The company confirmed the 7.2bn acquisition on Monday morning after reaching the deal at the weekend. The combined unit will become Spain＊s second-biggest telecoms operator, challenging the dominance of the incumbent Telefonica, and is a step towards Vodafone＊s goal of becoming a major player in fixed-line services as well as its mobile business.

Vittorio Colao, Vodafone＊s chief executive, said the deal would create ※a leading integrated communications provider in Spain§ and that the company is now ※a more unified provider, not just a mobile one§. Since agreeing to sell Vodafone＊s prize asset 每 its 45pc stake in the US mobile operator Verizon Wireless 每 last September, Mr Colao has quickly set to work investing the proceeds of the $130bn deal, with Ono the first major acquisition in the post-Verizon era.

The company had also previously agreed to the 6.5bn takeover of Germany＊s Kabel Deutschland , and is putting 7bn into ※Project Spring§ , the development of its own infrastructure, as it becomes a so-called ※quad-play§ operator 每 selling broadband, landline and television services as well as mobile.

However, Mr Colao ruled out any imminent acquisitions in the UK, where Vodafone does not have a fixed-line offering for consumers. He shut down suggestions that the company was interested in ITV, a rumoured target, or Channel 5, which its owner Richard Desmond has put up for sale .

※For the time being the UK is not a quad-play market. We continue to have a mostly mobile consumer strategy,§ Mr Colao said. ※Every market has different dynamics, [in the UK] we are focused on commercial agreements with others for the time being.§

Ono, which has 1.9m customers in Spain and a high-speed network that can reach 7m homes, will be bought using cash and debt. The deal was agreed in Madrid over the weekend after Vodafone quickly moved to block Ono＊s threat of listing the business. Previous bids from as low as 6.5bn had been rejected by Ono＊s shareholders.

The Spanish company is majority owned by New York private equity groups Thomas H Lee Partners, Providence Equity Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital. It made a pre-tax profit of 1.1bn last year, and Vodafone claimed it had potential to reach a much larger audience 每 claiming it had far fewer customers as a proportion of its network than European counterparts such as Virgin Media.

Further acquisitions are likely to be on the cards as Vodafone decides how to spend the remaining proceeds of the Verizon sale, the majority of which has been handed to shareholders. Nick Read, the incoming chief financial officer, said the 18bn of debt that Vodafone will carry after completing the Ono deal equated to around 1.5 times earnings, below the multiple of two the company is aiming for in the near term.
