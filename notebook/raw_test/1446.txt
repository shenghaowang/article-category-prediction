After three years in development, the UK¡¯s highly anticipated 12-sided coin hits the market today (March 28). Billed as the ¡°world¡¯s most secure coin¡± by the Royal Mint, the new one-pound coin has numerous anti-counterfeiting features usually only found in banknotes: micro-lettering, holograms, and an embedded high security feature curiously named iSIS (Integrated Secure Identification Systems). The old coin was round.

This is the pound coin¡¯s first update in more than 30 years, intended to thwart an apparent epidemic of counterfeiting: One in 30 1 coins currently in circulation (amounting to 45 million) are fake, estimates The Royal Mint.

The coin¡¯s reverse side (¡°tails¡±) features a new motif that marries symbols from the four countries comprising the UK: the English rose, the Welsh daffodil, the Scottish thistle, and the Northern Irish shamrock. It was designed by 17-year old David Pearce whose ¡°refined¡± montage bested 6,000 entries in an open competition organized by the Royal Mint in 2015.

But not everything about the coin¡¯s design is new. Its shape is a throwback to the brass 12-sided threepenny bit used from 1937 to 1971. The gold on silver bimetallic design is already used in the current two-pound coins.

Queen Elizabeth¡¯s official portrait by 36-year old engraver Jody Clark, which appears on the old coins, will be reused in this issue. Clark used computer-aided design software to turn his sketch to a low-relief engraving, and his initials will appear on 1.5 billion new coins.

Though numismatists are celebrating the return of the dodecagonal specie, critics of the coin say the update is a royal waste. ¡°The UK is swiftly moving towards a new cultural phenomena: the cashless society,¡± said Simon Black, CEO of e-payment specialists PPRO, in a statement. ¡°The current, or old pound coin, has been in our pockets for more than thirty years. I predict a much shorter lifespan for this new coin which I anticipate will be nothing more than a collector¡¯s item in less than ten years.¡±

The Royal Mint encourages everyone to shake out their coin jars and piggy banks. The old round quids will cease to be legal tender after Oct. 15.
