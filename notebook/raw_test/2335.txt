Doomed Flight MH370 has been 'found' on Google Earth, according to an Australian amateur expert in air crash investigations.

The flight, carrying 239 people, vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.

A massive search operation by China, Australia and Malaysia, costing 115m, came to an end in January 2017 without success.

But Peter McMahon, 64, insists he has found the plane.

He has pored through NASA and Google Maps images since the plane disappeared four years ago and believes the plane is 10 miles south of Round Island, a small islet north of Mauritius .

In one snap, the outline of what appears to be an aircraft is visible below the water¡¯s surface.

McMahon told Daily Star Online : ¡°Four Americans were sent to Australia to oversee the findings of MH370.

¡°They have made sure that all information received has been hidden from the public, even our government ¨C but why?¡±

McMahon says authorities ¡°do not want it found as it¡¯s full of bullet holes, finding it will only open another inquiry¡±.

Ghyslain Wattrelos lost his wife and two children in the tragedy. He believes the plane was shot down.

He thinks Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand could be withholding vital information.

Ghyslain said: ¡°All the military from these countries have seen the plane, if we believe that version. Why are they silent?

¡°I do not know, but there are also other countries that have information like England with Inmarsat, with Rolls-Royce, like the United States with Boeing and like the FBI who went the next day and took the pilot's flight simulator and never said anything to the investigators.

¡°Why this silence? There is something we do not want to say in this story.¡±

There are many theories as to what happened to MH370, though none have convinced the families of the victims or investigators.

They range from alien abduction to hijacking claims.
