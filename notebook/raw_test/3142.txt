iStock/Thinkstock(CARLSBAD, N.M.) ¡ª New air samples from a nuclear waste dump shut down because of a fire and release of radiation last month indicate new problems.

The sample shows that more radiation was released into the air on March 11 at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M. Officials say there is no expected health impact to workers, the public or the environment, but it is yet another problem for the site, which a report found has been suffering from lax safety regulations.

The man who managed WIPP, which takes in low-level nuclear waste from the nation¡¯s weapons program, was replaced a week ago.

There is no timetable for re-opening the 15-year-old Department of Energy facility.
