If General Motors needs any more indication of how its own safety issues could play out, it need look no farther than Toyota.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Toyota will pay $1.2 billion to end a criminal probe into its handling of reports of unintended acceleration.

That's on top of millions of dollars in fines to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and class-action settlements.

General Motors is now under fire for deadly ignition switches in 1.6 million vehicles built in the middle of the last decade that are part of the worldwide recall announced last month. It's just starting the process.

Just as the Justice Department closes its criminal investigation of Toyota, it was disclosed last week that a new one is believed to be underway involving GM.

"The timing of this (Toyota) settlement is interesting because it means the government will finalizing the last major automotive recall, Toyota's unintended acceleration, just as it gears up for the next big recall related to GM's ignition switch," says Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, in a statement. "The cases are similar because they both involve a long, established history of vehicle incidents that took years to identify and address."

Just as Toyota's CEO was brought from Japan to testify to congressial committees, GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that it's "likely" she will be called to testify to congressional panels as well over the switch issue.

She says GM took too long to acknowledge a problem. She named a safety czar, just as Toyota did when it was under fire.

It's yet to be seen how the ignition switch issue will play out for GM. But its executives have to be paying close attention to Toyota's travails -- and be worried.
