The Royal Mint, it seems, is admitting defeat on the battle with fake 1 coins and will, after 30 years, reinvent the coin as a new 12-sided coin, the "most secure circulating coin in the world".

Around 3pc of all 1 coins, of 45 million in circulation, are now forgeries up from 1pc or 15 million a decade ago.

The figure had risen from 2.74pc to 3.04pc in the last survey alone, in November.

Most of us only discover we have one when we go to put them in a parking meter and find they are rejected, others are more obvious.

The pound coin, made from a mixture of copper, zinc and nickel, was introduced in April 1983 to replace the 1 note.

Fake coins are largely made of lead and then sprayed with gold paint. This means that the weight often feels different to genuine pound coins and the surfaces are notably different.
 The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year). A list of designs and dates is available here.
 The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year.
 The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed. The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined.
 Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age.
 The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins.
 The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line.

What do I do with a fake coin?

Vigilance in the first place is your only hope. You decline a fake pound when it's given to you. It is an offence to try and pass the coin on. In theory, they should be handed to the police.

Banks will not refund those left holding fakes. This can be very costly for small shopkeepers who take their till takings to branches.

Based on the 3pc prevalence of fakes, nearly all of us will be handling at least a few fakes each year, often without knowing.

How does our fake problem compare with elsewhere?

The 5 rand coin in 2004 was reissued after taxi-drivers and shopkeepers in South Africa started to refuse to accept them. Fakes were just 2 per cent of all coins.

Previous estimates of euro coins suggest they are far harder to counterfeit. Only 0.1pc of euros 每 some 10m 每 were fakes, according to research in 2006. Fakes are more prevalent among 2 coins, the European Commission said last year.

Why will the new 1 coin be better?

The Mint said the new 12-sided coins will be made from two different coloured metals 每 as yet to be decided 每 and contain an "iSIS security feature". This is to do with the Integrated Secure Identification System developed by the Mint. It applies this existing security technology "that has been proven over decades in banknotes" to coins for the first time. Those are the only details released. The coins will enter circulation in 2015.
