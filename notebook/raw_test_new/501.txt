Shares of eBay (EBAY) are up 35 cents, or 0.6%, at $57.77, as the company's war of words with activist investor Carl Icahn continues.

This afternoon, Icahn tweeted to followers that he had released a new letter criticizing the company's management, accusing them of withholding critical documents he has requested pertaining to the company's sale of Skype, which he has said demonstrated conflict of interest on the part of the board of directors when the transaction was done:

While the board and its advisors may try to use tricks and technicalities to keep documentary evidence of malfeasance out of the hands of stockholders, I believe that ultimately truth will win out. It may not be in time for this year's annual meeting and it may even take years, but I believe that we will ultimately be successful in forcing eBay to come clean with its stockholders and disclose publicly all documents relating to the Skype affair, only some of the sordid details of which we recently exposed. And when that day comes, I believe that eBay, CEO John Donahoe, director Marc Andreessen and Chairman and founder Pierre Omidyar will be forced to recant their statements that my claims were "false and misleading."

Icahn, you'll recall, has urged eBay to spin out its PayPal payments unit. As the company resisted, Icahn moved on to questioning the judgement of CEO John Donahoe and members of the board, using the Skype transaction as evidence of bad faith and lack of concern for shareholders.

Today's missive follows an article yesterday by re/code's Jason Del Rey in which he quotes a statement from eBay saying Icahn is not legally entitled to documents he has requested.

Update: eBay has responded in an email statement:
