THE CHANCELLOR George Osborne will announce a historic change to UK currency in his Budget today: a new pound coin.The new pound will have 12-sides and is modelled on the old threepenny bit. It will be composed of two different coloured metals, like the 2 coin, and feature the Queen¡¯s head on one side and another motif, to be decided by a competition, on the other.The change will be the first major overhaul since the pound was introduced in 1983 and is in part due to the volume of forged coins now in circulation; around three per cent of all coins, according to the Royal Mint.The pound will boast the Mint¡¯s new iSIS technology, which will make it the most secure coin anywhere in the world. Osborne will announce the change today, alongside a consultation to determine the cost to businesses.The Bank of England welcomed the new coin, which will be introduced in 2017.
