The UK service sector slowed sharply in August, recording its weakest growth this year, an industry survey has suggested.

The Markit/Cips services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.1 in the month, down from 55.4 in July. Any figure above 50 indicates growth.

The monthly fall was the biggest in more than a decade.

Confidence in the service sector's future also fell to its lowest level in a year.
