The unemployment rate in Kansas escalated to 3.9 percent in August in response to manufacturing layoffs and a revision of government job estimates, officials said Friday.

The Kansas Department of Labor and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the seasonally adjusted joblessness rate increased by 0.2 percent since July. The number of Kansans unable to find a job increased by 1,700 to 57,308.

In August 2016, the Kansas unemployment figure was 4.3 percent.

Emilie Doerksen, an economist with the state¡¯s labor department, said total nonfarm employment expanded by 800 jobs last month. Resurgence in private-sector jobs was offset by temporary layoffs and downgrading of government job estimates, she said.

"Total nonfarm job estimates for Kansas increased by 800 jobs in August. This growth was concentrated in the private sector, with three industries adding more than 1,000 jobs each," Doerksen said. "Some of this growth was offset by decreases in government job estimates, as well as temporary layoffs that impacted the manufacturing industry."

In terms of manufacturing employment, the state had 157,000 men and women in that line of work in August. That¡¯s less than the 158,000 in July and the 159,000 in August 2016.

Government employment also slipped to 252,000 jobs last month compared to 256,000 in July and 255,000 one year ago. Employment in trade, transportation and utilities sector expanded to 266,000 jobs in August, up from 265,000 in July and down from 268,000 in August of last year.

In the past year, officials said, Kansas has lost 9,000 seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs. The state¡¯s portfolio of private-sector jobs has fallen by 6,300 since August 2016.
