LONDON: The world's largest money transfer company Western Union said on Friday it has suspended its services for Russia's Bank Rossiya.

In a statement, Western Union said its money transfer service continues to be available at its 20,000 plus locations and self-service terminals across Russia.

Earlier on Friday Bank Rossiya said Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had stopped providing services for payment transactions for its clients.

Bank Rossiya, which has $10 billion in assets and is used by many senior Russian government officials, was hit by U.S. sanctions imposed in response to the annexation of Crimea.
