Last week the United States Mint revealed images of the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coins and this week the bureau announced their introductory and regular prices.

On March 27, 2014 at 12 noon ET, the U.S. Mint will release its first ever curved coins in gold, silver and clad to celebrate the National Baseball Hall of Fame and its diamond anniversary.

Those buying any of the commemoratives during the first 30 days will catch a price discount ranging from $4 ¨C $5 per coin. Offered in collector proof and uncirculated qualities, the U.S. Mint will sell up to 750,000 clad half-dollars, up to 400,000 silver dollars and up to 50,000 $5 gold coins.

Here are price points for the coins:

*Pricing of the clad and silver commemorative coins are static while those minted in gold can vary each Wednesday depending on a weekly average of the London gold fixing. The gold coin prices are based on an average gold fixing that is within a range of $1,350.00 to $1,399.99 an ounce. Every $50 move from that range, up or down, will result in a $12.15 adjustment in the price of the gold coins. (See Mint gold coin pricing chart.)

Introductory pricing ends on April 28, 2014 at 5 p.m. ET, when regular pricing takes effect. At that time, buyers will have to pay $4 more for each clad half-dollar and $5 more for each silver dollar.

As mandated by the law authorizing the coins, Public Law 112-152, the above totals already include surcharges of $35 for each gold coin, $10 for each silver dollar, and $5 for each half-dollar. Collected amounts will get paid to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to help fund its operations.

When released at 12:00 PM ET on March 27, the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coins may be ordered from the U.S. Mint website at www.usmint.gov/catalog.
