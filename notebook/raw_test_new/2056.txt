France has new satellite images showing possible debris in southern search zone, Malaysia said Sunday.

¡°This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities,'' Malaysia's transport ministry said in a statement. "Malaysia immediately relayed these images to the Australian rescue co-ordination center.''

The ministry did not give any other details on the satellite images, but the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it would soon release the pictures.

The latest lead comes as the international search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 entered its third week, with still no confirmed trace of the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board.

"This morning, Malaysia received new satellite images from the French authorities showing potential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor," the Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement.

An international air and search resumed Sunday, zeroing in on two areas some approximately 1,500 miles southwest of Perth in an effort to find the object identified by China and other small debris including a wooden pallet spotted by a search plane on Saturday.

"The weather in the southern Indian Ocean is much clearer today than the past couple days, allowing for the full spectrum electronic and visual of search capability," Commander William J. Marks, spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, said in an email, according to Reuters.

Earlier, the commander of an Australian navy ship involved in the search said its crew was ¡°acutely aware¡± that families are anxious for news. ¡°We see it as our role to do whatever we can to provide them the answers they deserve,¡± HMAS Success commanding officer Captain Allison Norris said.
