Premier Li Keqiang vowed to build a sound social security net for the public, including an integrated pension arrangement for rural and urban residents.

More than 800 million of China's populace are covered by different pension programs, Li said.

The government will gradually enhance the pension level and merge scattered pension arrangements to promote equal access to social welfare, he said.

The government will also work harder to provide assistance and help for underprivileged social groups, including those who experience difficulty after being hit by natural disasters or disease, he added.
