The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has imposed an import alert, effectively a ban, on Indian generic drugmaker plant in Gujarat.

An "import alert" results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices, according to the FDA website.

A spokesman for Sun Pharma, India's biggest drugmaker by market value, was not available for comment.
