Unemployment numbers released Monday yielded mixed news for Virginia. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5 percent in January, the Virginia Employment Commission said. That was the lowest rate in more than five years and the sixth straight monthly decline. The state's seasonally adjusted jobless rate had been 5.7 percent in January 2013 and 5.2 percent in December.

The rate without seasonal adjustments, however, rose to 5.4 percent in January from 4.8 percent in December. But the figure was lower than the 6.3 percent rate in January 2013.

Nonfarm employment in Virginia declined slightly over the past year to nearly 3,759,000. In Hampton Roads, that figure fell nearly 1 percent to 748,200.
