Russian stocks and government bonds fell today after the US and European Union increased sanctions against Russian politicians and business leaders.

The Micex index was off over 2% by midday, while the RTS was down 2.4%.

The falls came after the US Treasury yesterday imposed sanctions on oil billionaire Gennady Timchenko, whose energy-trading company has close links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He was one of 20 added to the US sanctions list.

The move is part of a wider effort to isolate key Russian figures after Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of the Crimea.
