(Kitco News) - Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with solid gains and hit a six-month high Wednesday. More safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish technical posture prompted buying interest. April gold was last up $19.80 at $1,366.50 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $17.00 at $1,367.00. May Comex silver last traded up $0.445 at $21.62 an ounce.

The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. This coming weekend could be pivotal in this geopolitical crisis. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the flashpoint in the region. The Group of Seven nations was set to release a statement Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia¡¯s invasion of Ukraine. It¡¯s likely that the G-7 will soon impose official economic and diplomatic sanctions on Russia.

U.S. economic data released Wednesday was again light and did not impact the markets. In other news Wednesday, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank¡¯s monetary policy. The ECB has been battling tepid EU economic growth and deflationary concerns with a very stimulative monetary policy.

While gold and the raw commodity sector have fared well in the first quarter of 2014, the copper market has seen its price fall dramatically the past week. Comex copper futures prices hit a nearly four-year low Wednesday. Part of the selling pressure on copper comes from concerns about weakening Chinese economic growth. Crude oil prices have also been pressured in part by the concerns about a weakening Chinese economy. China is the world¡¯s largest copper consumer. Copper is a major industrial metal worldwide. And many veteran stock market watchers say copper¡¯s price move can be a harbinger of price action in the U.S. stock market. Concern about the health of the Chinese economy has weighed down the Asian and European stock markets this week. The fact gold has been able to make gains this week, despite the above circumstances, is impressive.

The London P.M. gold fix is $1,366.00 versus the previous P.M. fixing of $1,346.25.
