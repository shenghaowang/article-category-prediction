Gold retreated for a second day as U.S. jobs data backed the case for the Federal Reserve to keep on reducing stimulus. Silver dropped to a three-week low, while platinum and palladium declined.

Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent to $1,327.94 an ounce, and was at $1,331.31 at 9:10 a.m. in Singapore. Prices posted a fifth weekly gain last week, climbing to a four-month high of $1,354.87 on March 3, as tension between Ukraine and Russia escalated, boosting demand for a haven.

Bullion rose 10 percent this year even as the Fed, which next meets March 18-19, announced a $10 billion reduction to bond buying at each of its past two meetings, leaving purchases at $65 billion. U.S. employers added 175,000 workers last month, compared with 149,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey.

¡°The better-than-expected payrolls data weighed on gold, but losses were limited by the political situation in Ukraine,¡± Sun Yonggang, a macroeconomic strategist at Everbright Futures Co., said from Shanghai. ¡°Both ETF and CFTC positions suggest that investors are still willing to hold gold for now,¡± said Sun, referring to gold in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and bets tracked by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Last week, holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products posted the first back-to-back weekly expansion since August, as pro-Russian forces advanced into the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Coutts & Co. said it¡¯s adding gold for investors as increasing geopolitical risks spur haven demand.

Gold for April delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,331.30 an ounce on the Comex in New York, extending the 1 percent loss on March 7. Hedge funds and other speculators expanded bets on higher prices for a fourth week in New York futures and are now the most bullish since December 2012, government data show.

Silver for immediate delivery fell as much as 1.6 percent to $20.6142 an ounce, the lowest level since Feb. 14, and traded at $20.741. The metal declined 2.5 percent on March 7 to cap a second weekly retreat.

Platinum lost 0.9 percent to $1,469.25 an ounce after posting a fifth weekly rise, the longest run since August. Palladium fell 0.4 percent to $778.50 an ounce after climbing for a fifth week, the longest rally since 2012, on concern that supplies from Russia and South Africa, the biggest producers, may be disrupted.

South Africa, also the world¡¯s largest platinum producer, won¡¯t take sides in a wage strike that halted output for more than six weeks, President Jacob Zuma said.
