Economic expectations for Germany worsened in March, burdened by the Crimea crisis, while the assessment of current situation hit the highest level since 2011, survey data from the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW revealed Tuesday.

The economic confidence index dropped more-than-expected to 46.6 in March from 55.7 in February. The March score was the weakest since August 2013. It was forecast to fall less markedly to 52.

"In this month's survey the Crimea Crisis is weighing on experts' economic expectations for Germany," said ZEW President Clemens Fuest.

"Nevertheless, the indicator's level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk."

Meanwhile, the measure of experts' assessment of the current economic situation improved to 51.3 points, the highest since August 2011, from 50 in February. The assessment strengthened for the fourth month in a row, but stayed below the expected level of 52.

The economic expectations index for the Eurozone declined by 7 points to 61.5 threshold. By contrast, the indicator for the current economic situation gained 3.5 points to minus 36.7 points in March.

Although the current political relationship with Russia might have limited impact on the German economy, the possible upcoming measures will put the German recovery to a serious test, ING Bank NV Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

The largest Eurozone economy grew 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter and the government expects it to expand 1.8 percent this year.

The European Commission raised the country's growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 1.7 percent and the projection for 2015 was lifted to 2 percent from 1.9 percent.
