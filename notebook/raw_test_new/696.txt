Walmart told The Associated Press that it has rolled out an online tool that allows shoppers to compare its prices on 80,000 food and household products to those of its competitors.



The retailer began offering the feature that's called "Savings Catcher" on its website last month in seven big markets that include Dallas, San Diego and Atlanta.



The move by Walmart, which has a long history of undercutting competitors, could change the way people shop and how other retailers price their merchandise.



Other retailers including Target and Best Buy offer to match the lower prices of rivals - but only if shoppers do the research on their own.



The idea behind Walmart's online feature, on the other hand, is to do the legwork for customers.
