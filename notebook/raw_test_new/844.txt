Citi Bike, hard-up for cash, shouldn¡¯t expect any help from Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The new mayor told reporters today that the city¡¯s bike-share program, reportedly bleeding money, will probably not be getting any public dollars to help fill its coffers.

¡°At this moment, that¡¯s not in our plans,¡± said Mr. de Blasio, responding to a question about whether the city would aid the privately-financed program at an unrelated press conference today. ¡°We want to see what we can do help them back on their feet using other methodologies.¡±

Despite their popularity in some neighborhoods and their ballyhooed¨Cif delayed¨Croll-out under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Citi Bike continues to lose money, according to today¡¯s Wall Street Journal. The report cited poor weather, rising operational costs, damage to equipment during Hurricane Sandy and unexpectedly low usage by tourists as reasons for the bike share¡¯s financial struggles.

Unlike bike-share programs in other cities, Citi Bike receives no public money. All revenue is raised through membership fees, corporate sponsorships and advertising. Polly Trottenberg, the city¡¯s new transportation commissioner, has left the door open to a possible price hike, but is in discussions with the company about other options.

¡°What Commissioner Trottenberg was doing is sitting down with the folks from Citi Bike and saying, ¡®What would help in terms of the way things are structured now, what would help you financially, with all the other possibilities that may be there?¡± Mr. de Blasio said. ¡°We¡¯re open to any proposal they have. Again, at this moment, city budget money is not on the table but we¡¯re open to other alternatives.¡±

The mayor, when pressed, further said he would be open to state or federal funding to keep the bikes running.

¡°If we can find that, that certainly would be great,¡± he said. ¡°But the point is I think it¡¯s a valuable service, it¡¯s proven to be a success, we want to see it continue, we want to see it expand and we¡¯re going to work with them to find alternatives.¡±
