DENTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As we previously stated on March 5th, our systems detected an unauthorized attempted intrusion into our Sally Beauty Supply LLC network. At the time of this discovery, we immediately engaged a top-tier forensics firm (Verizon) to investigate this security incident. As a result of this ongoing investigation, we have now discovered evidence that fewer than 25,000 records containing card-present (track 2) payment card data have been illegally accessed on our systems and we believe it may have been removed. As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation. As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident.

We take this criminal activity very seriously. We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident. In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter.

Customers are our top priority at Sally Beauty, and we will be responding to customers' needs concerning this security incident. Please check our website sallybeautyholdings.com in the coming days to learn about the progress of our work to address the security incident, the status of our investigation, and steps we will be taking to assist any affected customer. We will be providing appropriate notifications to affected consumers and others, as necessary, as the facts develop and we learn more.
