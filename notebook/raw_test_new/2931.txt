China Unicom, one of China's three telecom giants, has joined the 4G parade. The company made it official with an announcement on Tuesday.China Unicom will operate its 4G network services in 25 cities. The company plans to increase that to 300 by the end of this year. There is something different to China Unicom¡¯s operating strategy since it was the last player to join the competition after China Mobile and China Telecom."China Unicom¡¯s 4G network development has a steady strategy. We are not getting rid of the 3G network to build the 4G network. In 2014, the 3G network is still considered our main concern, while the 4G network is a supplement to hotspot areas," said Xiong Yu, General Manager, Marketing Dept., China Unicom.China Unicom¡¯s 3G network has been upgraded in most areas to 42M. That¡¯s already equivalent to the speed of many overseas 4G networks. China Unicom will charge for 4G and 3G service together.Moreover, China Unicom on Tuesday released about 60 terminal devices, 25 of them for the 4G network. It¡¯s estimated that China Unicom¡¯s terminal device sales will reach 188 million units, About 100 million of the units will support both 3G and 4G networks.
