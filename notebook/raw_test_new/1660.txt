Florida¡¯s June unemployment rate dropped slightly, but the trend didn¡¯t apply in Collier and Lee counties as the summer job market arrived.

Florida¡¯s unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 percent in May to 6.2 percent in June, with 601,000 people still out of work in a labor force of 9,642,000.

But in Collier County, the rate rose from 5.4 percent in May to 5.8 percent in June. In Lee County, it increased from 5.8 percent in May to 6.1 percent in June.

Gov. Rick Scott of Naples announced June unemployment numbers Friday at Shaw Development in Bonita Springs.

¡°As I travel the state, the most important thing people can say is ¡®I like my job¡¯ or ¡®I want a job.¡¯ People want to work,¡± Scott said.

Scott said about 36,900 Florida jobs were created in June, more than in any month since he took office nearly four years go.

¡°This news is great for Florida families, and Florida continues to have great success in our state¡¯s economic recovery,¡± Scott said. ¡°Let¡¯s keep working so that every person who wants a job can get one here in Florida.¡±

The state¡¯s jobless rate has remained largely flat for the first half of 2014, but for the first time in more than a year, Florida¡¯s rate is higher than the national rate. The U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent in June.

Beth Barger, center supervisor at the CareerSource Naples office, said the uptick in employment in the state may have to do with employers¡¯ need for more skilled trades.

¡°We¡¯re starting to see construction jobs come back, and we hadn¡¯t seen any of those for a while,¡± she said.

Curt Bradbury, communications manager at CareerSource Southwest Florida, said Collier and Lee¡¯s jobless rates fluctuate mostly based on the time of year.

Comparing June to a year ago, Collier¡¯s rate decreased by 1.7 percent since June 2013, from 7.5 percent to 5.8 percent. Lee County¡¯s rate also fell from last year¡¯s 7.7 percent in June 2013 to 6.1 percent this year.

¡°The unemployment rate here compared to the rest of the state has to do with season,¡± Bradbury said. ¡°We always pick up in wintertime and have a downturn in the summertime.¡±

Barger said the hospitality industry and education contributed to the rise in Collier and Lee¡¯s June unemployment numbers.

¡°You have a lot of folks that enter into the unemployment market short-term over the summer,¡± Barger said.

Bradbury said the current labor market is favorable for employers.

¡°Certainly there is more hiring going on,¡± he said. ¡°The economy is getting better and employers are more selective.¡±

However, it¡¯s not all great news for potential employees.

¡°There¡¯s more hiring going on, but unfortunately still lots of positions are vacant because employers can pick and choose ...,¡± Bradbury said.

¡°More and more jobs are opening up, so we¡¯re continuing to see the economy grow,¡± Barger said. ¡°We¡¯re also seeing employers take a risk to hire more folks. They¡¯re small but steady gains.¡±

Also on Friday, Scott awarded Kevin Hawkesworth, president and CEO of Shaw Development, with the Governor¡¯s Business Ambassador Award. He also awarded several employees from Shaw Development with the Governor¡¯s Veteran¡¯s Service Award, and recognized Bonita Springs Mayor Ben Nelson Jr.

Since Scott took office in January 2011, the state¡¯s unemployment rate has dropped from 11.1 percent to 6.2 percent. Also during that time, 620,700 private-sector jobs have been created throughout the state.

Economists have said the state¡¯s unemployment rate will not change as sharply as it once did. The state¡¯s economy is recovering, but it is a much slower and drawn out recovery than previous ones. A new economic overview released this week by Florida¡¯s Office of Economic and Demographic Research predicted that ¡°it will take a few more years to climb completely out of the hole left by the recession.¡±

As the recovery takes hold, people begin looking for work again and that¡¯s reflected in the monthly numbers of the unemployed in the labor force.

Back in December, for example, there was an estimated 584,000 people out of work. The June numbers put the total of jobless Floridians at 597,000.

The new numbers show Walton County in Florida¡¯s Panhandle had the lowest unemployment rate at 3.4 percent, while the highest jobless rate in the state is 10.4 percent in Hendry County.
