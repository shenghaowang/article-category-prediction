LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday he was concerned that an improvement in the housing market could lead to a worsening of mortgage underwriting standards.

¡°Underwriting standards at present of mortgage providers are quite high...,¡± said Carney in remarks to a committee of lawmakers.

¡°Our concern is that those underwriting standards will deteriorate and that that deterioration itself would be fed by general improvement in the housing market.¡±

Britain¡¯s recovery to date has been driven by household spending and a revival in the property market. Mortgage approvals in January hit their highest since November 2007.
