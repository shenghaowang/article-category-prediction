Alabama's unemployment rate remains at 6 percent, unchanged from the previous month.

The Alabama Department of Labor announced the jobless rate for June on Friday.

The number is the same as May and represents 130,439 unemployed people in the state. The state says June employment actually rose by almost 34,000 people, but the gain wasn't enough to lower the unemployment number.

The jobless rate is slightly lower than the June 2015 rate of 6.1 percent. But Alabama's unemployment rate remains well above the national unemployment rate of 4.9 percent.

Shelby County has the state's lowest unemployment rate at 4.8 percent, and Wilcox County is highest at 15.1 percent.

Sumter County's jobless rate was 9.8 percent in June. The percentage was 9.3 percent in Choctaw County. It was 8.4 percent in Marengo County.
