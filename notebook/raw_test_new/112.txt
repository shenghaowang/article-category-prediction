NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has updated its website to allow users to view their account balances, a function that had been suspended since late February when the company wiped its website clean of information and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. "Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users," the exchange said on its website. Mt. Gox on Feb. 28 filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed it had lost thousands of its customers bitcoins. Mt. Gox has also filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S., where it faces a class-action lawsuit.
