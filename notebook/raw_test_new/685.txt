China Mobile Ltd.'s 0941 net profit in 2017 rose 5.1% from a year earlier, thanks to strong demand for faster wireless services despite intensifying competition.

China Mobile, counted among the top mobile carriers in terms of subscribers, said Thursday its net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 was 114.28 billion yuan (US$18.1 billion) compared with CNY108.74 billion a year earlier. The result was almost in line with the CNY114.43 billion net profit forecast in a poll of 20 analysts by FactSet.

Total operating revenue rose 4.5% to CNY740.51 billion, while revenue from telecommunications services also increased 7.2% to CNY668.35 billion.

The company with a dominant share of the Chinese mobile market, had 887 million subscribers in 2017. But it has been under pressure from smaller rivals such as China Telecom Corp. Ltd. (0728.HK) and China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (0762.HK), as part of the government's continued effort to promote competition.
