Airbnb, a site that allows users to rent out couches, rooms, apartments and homes could be valued as much as $10 billion, a report says.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the startup is in the process of starting a new fundraising round worth $400 million to $500 million.

The company hasn't disclosed revenue or profitability. According to its site, there are more than 600,000 listings worldwide.

At $10 billion, Airbnb would be worth more than several large hotel companies, even more so than Wyndham Worldwide and Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, says the report.
