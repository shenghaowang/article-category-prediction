Walmart joins in on the used video game market

There are a lot of used video games out there, sitting in people¡¯s homes and collecting dust. Video game stores like GameStop have been reigning supreme in the used video game market for a while, and now Walmart is going to get in on the action.

This Wednesday, March 26th, gamers will be able to trade in their used video games in exchange for an e-gift card that can go towards any items sold at Walmart or Sam¡¯s Club. It¡¯s not limited to just the stores, since you¡¯ll be able to trade online as well.

Once the game is traded, it will be refurbished and made available this summer in like-new condition. Personally, it¡¯s going to be weird checking out the video game aisle and seeing used video games mixed in with new games.
