The Justice Department is expected to announce a settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. as early as Wednesday that could cost the auto maker more than $1 billion to end a criminal probe into its disclosure of safety issues, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal would cap a four-year investigation with one of the largest fines ever imposed on an auto maker.

It is expected to include a deferred prosecution agreement which would allow Toyota 7203, -0.96% TM, -0.30% to avoid criminal charges provided it meets conditions imposed by the court, and would appoint an external monitor to oversee Toyota¡¯s adherence to conditions of the agreement, the people said.

The settlement isn¡¯t final and could still fall apart, some of these people said.

A spokeswoman for Toyota said Toyota had already moved to address many of the issues raised in the investigation.

¡°Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney¡¯s office in this matter for more than four years,¡± Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said. ¡°During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.¡±

The investigation has been headed by the Manhattan offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney and focused on the way Toyota disclosed issues related to allegations of unintended acceleration in its cars in the late 2000s.
