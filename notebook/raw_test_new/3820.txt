Late on Thursday, Turkey's government attempted to ban Twitter. It didn't go well. Turkish Twitter users are finding it easy to get around the ban and are even mocking it, with one widely shared picture showing a bunch of Twitter-style birds defecating on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan's head.

Why Erdoan? The prime minister is believed to be the driving force behind the ban. "Twitter, mwitter!" Erdoan had reportedly told supporters at a rally on Thursday. "We will wipe out all of these." Erdoan's office has justified the ban by pointing to a Turkish court order that demanded the online service take down links that had allegedly insulted Turkish citizens.

But the timing of the ban 每 just days before municipal elections on March 30 每 is key. Turkey's ban on Twitter reflects broader issues in Turkish society, and rising insecurity among Erdoan's allies.

What they apparently don't realize is that blocking Twitter is unlikely to make any of it better.

Erdoan and the Islamist AK Party have dominated Turkish politics since 2002, when they were swept to power after decades of secular rule and frequent coups by Turkey's powerful military. While there have been some troubling signs 每 according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkey was the top jailer of journalists worldwide in 2013, and critics say AKP has used accusations of a secular anti-government plot to jail their enemies 每 many citizens were encouraged by Erdoan's pro-business and pro-European Union policies. The country has also become a key military ally of the United States and an important actor in the Muslim world.

In 2015, however, Erdoan will be forced to vacate the prime minister's office; he is limited by party rules to three terms. While he hasn't formally committed to it yet, there is a huge amount of speculation that he will attempt to move into the office of president this year, and use the AKP's political power to strengthen the position, which is largely a figurehead under current circumstances. Critics of Erdoan have accused him of "Putinism," and for significant parts of Turkish society 每 especially those who fear a creeping Islamization of Turkey's largely secular society 每 such a shift is scary.

Things came to a head in May 2013, when the government announced plans to redevelop Istanbul's Taksim Gezi Park into a shopping mall designed to look like an Ottoman-era military barracks. Locals were angry with a move that would have not only destroyed one of the most prominent green spaces in the Istanbul city center, but would also replace it with a monument to the twin themes of Erdoan's time as leader: Capitalism and Islamist nationalism. Thousands of people descended on Gezi Park for huge anti-government protests. Police responded with a heavy handed crackdown, and at least eight people died.

The Gezi Park protests were a huge challenge to Erdoan's authority, and Twitter clearly played a role in spreading discontent: Protesters used #gezipark to share scenes from the protest, and the controversial death of a 15-year-old boy reportedly hit by a police tear gas canister was announced on the service. But these protests alone might not have prompted such a drastic response from the Turkish government: Instead, Erdoan's Twitter clampdown seems to be specifically targeting a more insidious threat that comes closer to his own base.

Late last year, a corruption scandal engulfed the AKP party, with dozens of high profile people linked to the party arrested and widespread calls for the prime minister to resign. While the investigation was ongoing, it appeared that someone with inside knowledge of the Turkish political elite's lives was leaking information: One recording, apparently from a tapped phone, shared online in February, appeared to feature Erdoan himself ordering his son to dispose of a large amount of cash (the prime minister says the recording was faked).

Erdoan has accused supporters of Fethullah G邦len, an enigmatic Islamic preacher now based in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a "coup" against him. G邦len's supporters, who form a broad group referred to by outsiders as the G邦len movement, had previously been allied with Erdoan, but now some analysts believe they are using their networks in the police and judiciary to help force the AKP from power. G邦len himself has denied any involvement and rejected claims the G邦len movement was political, but has lashed out at Turkey's prime minister, calling Erdoan's leadership "ten times" worse than Turkey's army coup era in a recent interview.

Erdoan's Twitter crackdown appears to be specifically targeting the alleged leaks, in particular one anonymous account named Haramzadeler, (which apparently is translated as ※Sons of Thieves§ but could also mean ※bastard§) and another called Bascalan (※Prime Thief,§ a play on the Turkish word for prime minister), according to Bloomberg. Erdoan has also threatened to ban Facebook and YouTube, two other services which he says are being used to share recordings that damage his government, be they real or fake.

The spectacular failure of Turkey's Twitter ban shows it's a little more complicated than that, however. Astute Internet users in the country were soon able to realize that they could still tweet via text, by changing their DNS settings, or by using a VPN. Services that monitor Twitter usage in Turkey have reported no visible drop in usage, according to Hurriyet Daily News. Many of Turkey's elite, even President Abdullah G邦l, have broken the ban.

That should probably worry Erdoan. If Twitter isn't going away, it seems unlikely his broader problems are either.

Correction: The post originally said that Erdoan was limited by constitutional term limits. It is in fact AK Party rules that limit his time in the prime minister's office.
