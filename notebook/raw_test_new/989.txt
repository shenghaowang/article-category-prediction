NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) ¡ª Firefighters are still on the scene of a stubborn fire in Brooklyn that burned all night at a recycling plant.

Crews were still putting out hot spots Wednesday morning at a 2-story recycling plant on Humboldt Street in Greenpoint.

About 160 firefighters responded to the 4-alarm fire, which broke out around 7 p.m. Tuesday.

Firefighters said what made battling the blaze more difficult was the amount of flammable materials inside the buildings ¡°It¡¯s a recycling plant, we had hundreds of bales of cardboard wrapped tight with steel bands and we also had numerous bales of rags,¡± FDNY Deputy Chief Brendan McSweeney told CBS 2¡¯s Weijia Jiang. ¡°Gaining final extinguishment is very difficult because everything is so compressed, it¡¯s very hard to get to the deep-seeded, charred, smoldering debris.¡± Officials said the part of a wall and the roof collapsed and at times, smoke could be seen across the river in Manhattan. ¡°This is a series of six interconnected buildings, it¡¯s a recycling complex. It¡¯s very heavily packed with all types of materials ¨C papers, plastics,¡± deputy fire chief Robert Strong told WCBS 880¡¯s Peter Haskell. ¡°We¡¯re just gonna have to keep pouring water on this thing until we can get it finally extinguished. That¡¯s gonna, unfortunately, take us a while to do that.¡± No word yet on what sparked the fire. Check Out These Other Stories From CBSNewYork.com:
