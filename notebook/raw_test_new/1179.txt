The Federal Reserve revised its ¡°stress test¡± results for Bank of America on Friday, resulting in a slightly poorer performance for the Charlotte-based bank.

The Fed said the bank¡¯s minimum capital ratio would drop to 5.9 percent in a severe, hypothetical economic crisis. The revised figure is lower than the Fed¡¯s 6 percent minimum ratio issued Thursday.

The new calculation still puts the bank above regulators¡¯ 5 percent minimum buffer for top-tier capital.

Since the financial crisis, major U.S. lenders participate in the annual health checks, which measure whether they would have enough of a capital cushion to continue lending in a downturn. This year¡¯s tests were based on how 30 bank holding companies would fare in a deep recession that would include a jump in unemployment and a 50 percent drop in the stock market.

Bank of America posted the lowest minimum capital ratio among big banks under Thursday¡¯s results. Friday¡¯s revisions did not change that.

Overall, the Fed revised its figures for 15 bank holding companies, adjusting some up and others down. In a press release, the Fed attributed the changes in part to ¡°inconsistencies¡± in how the tests treated fourth quarter 2013 dividend increases or stock buybacks.

BB&T fared better under the revisions, with its minimum ratio climbing to 8.4 percent from 8.2 percent in the initial results. Wells Fargo¡¯s results were unchanged at 8.2 percent.

In this year¡¯s round of testing, only Utah-based Zions Bancorporation failed to meet the minimum capital buffer requirement. Friday¡¯s changes did not result in any additional banks falling below the 5 percent minimum hurdle.

A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment on the Fed¡¯s revised figure.
