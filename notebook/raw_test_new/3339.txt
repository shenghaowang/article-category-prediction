Malaysia said Sunday it had received new satellite data from France indicating floating objects in the search area for a missing Malaysian jet in the southern Indian Ocean.The transport ministry said the information had been passed on to Australian authorities coordinating the search for the plane, now focused on a remote stretch of ocean 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth.The ministry said the latest data came in the form of images but France's foreign ministry later clarified this, saying it came in the form of "satellite-generated radar echoes."A radar echo is an electronic signal that contains information about the location and distance of the object which bounces the signal back.According to the French statement, the debris was floating around 2,300 kilometers from Perth.The sense that the hunt was finally on the right track after more than two weeks of false leads and dead ends was reinforced by the latest satellite images.Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard.Malaysia, which later revealed the plane turned back over the Malaysian peninsula after losing contact, has enlisted 25 other countries in the search.Efforts in recent days have focused on the coast off Australia after previous satellite images of large objects there were released. Sightings of a wooden cargo pallet, along with some belts or straps, which may be linked to the passenger jet, raised hopes.The "first visual sighting" came after fresh Chinese satellite images emerged showing a large floating object in the same region around 2,500 kilometers southwest of Perth.Meanwhile, two Chinese Air Force Ilyushin IL-76 planes will head toward the search area early Monday and provide relevant information for Chinese naval search vessels, Commander Liu Dianjun said Sunday.The two planes will fly from RAAF Base Pearce to Perth and will leave for the sea area in the southern Indian Ocean, where objects possibly related to MH370 were spotted by satellites. Liu said the Chinese aircraft will make a roughly eight-hour round-trip flight during their mission, with the furthest point 2,700 kilometers away from Perth.Chinese icebreaker Xuelong is expected to arrive Tuesday at the area in the southern Indian Ocean. The long-serving Antarctic research vessel is still some 1046 kilometers away from the search area, and it will take the icebreaker another 40 hours to get there.The Malaysia Airlines work team in Beijing Sunday had a 7-hour closed-door meeting with families of Chinese passengers on board. One of the relatives said that the plane was unlikely to have descended on land and the fact it disappeared from radar might be caused by the radar limitation, China News Service reported.
