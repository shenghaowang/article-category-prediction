American Eagle Outfitters Inc.'s profit in the fourth quarter tanked on lower sales and one-time charges.

The South Side-based teen-apparel retailer said net income was $10.5 million, or 5 cents a share, in the 13 weeks ended Feb. 1. That compares with net income of $94.8 million, or 47 cents a share, in the 14 weeks ended Feb. 2, 2013.

¡°The company's results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations,¡± interim CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a statement. ¡°We're taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers.¡±

After removing one-time write-offs, American Eagle's adjusted net income in the quarter was 27 cents a share, down from 55 cents a share the year before.

Analysts had expected adjusted net income of 26 cents a share, according to Bloomberg.

Sales were $1 billion in the quarter, down from $1.1 billion the year before. Sales at stores open at least a year declined 7 percent.

The company fired CEO Robert Hanson in January after disappointing holiday sales. Schottenstein, the company's chairman and former CEO, took over on an interim basis.

American Eagle expects first-quarter sales to decline and profit to be flat, as ¡°business conditions remain challenging, with severe winter weather contributing to weak demand.¡±
