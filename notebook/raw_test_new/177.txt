Japanese lender Mizuho is facing legal action over the collapse of Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange which lost over half a billion dollars of customers¡¯ digital currency.

The bank has been added as a defendant to a present lawsuit against Mt. Gox with accuses of being a part of a fraud by offering banking services to the exchange.

According to the amended complaint by an Illinois resident Gregory Greene, Mizuho held non-bitcoin currency on Mt. Gox¡¯s behalf and its customers, and that he lost $25,000 when the exchange was shut down last month.

In addition, Mizuho was added in a class-action lawsuit in Canada against Mt. Gox over an alleged lengthy security breach.

Mt. Gox has filed for a US Chapter 15 bankruptcy, which protected the company from lawsuits in US.
