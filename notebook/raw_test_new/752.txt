German top-of-the-range carmaker BMW said Wednesday it expects pre-tax profit to rise sharply this year after the group reported record sales and earnings last year.

 "The BMW group can look forward with confidence to the current financial year," chief executive Norbert Reithofer told the carmaker's annual earnings news conference.

 Group profit before tax and sales volume are both expected to rise to new highs, he said.

 "We are aiming to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, which would take us to a new all-time high of over two million vehicles," the chief executive stated.
