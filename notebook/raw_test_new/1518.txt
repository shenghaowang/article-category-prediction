Symantec shares dropped almost 13% in early trading Friday after the antivirus and computer security company suddenly fired its CEO late Thursday.

CEO Steve Bennett was terminated by the board as "the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety," according to a statement by Symantec.

Investors were stunned by the move which FBR analyst Daniel Ives described as "jaw dropping" in a note to clients.

The board is setting up a search process to find a permanent replacement. Michael Brown, a board member who joined the company following Symantec's purchase of Veritas, is being installed as temporary CEO and president. Bennett had described it plan to turnaround the company in January 2013. The board of directors, though, was looking for a faster turnaround, Ives says. The company's forecast for the March quarter was below what Wall Street was looking for.

Analysts currently rate Symantec an outperform and have a 12-month price target of $24.96, says S&P Capital IQ.

Shares were down $2.60 to $18.30 in afternoon trading.

"While we believe the company was slowly heading in the right direction," Ives says. "Last night's announcement leaves a major black-eye on Symantec."
