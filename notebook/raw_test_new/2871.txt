The Tennessee Valley Authority is improving the timeliness with which is handles complaints from its non-nuclear staff, but a new audit of worker concerns found "some employees feel that concerns are not being adequately addressed and reported experiencing pressure and repercussions from management."

In a report released Monday, TVA's Inspector General recommends that TVA identify an individual to audit and assess employee concerns after the cases are closed. The IG also thinks TVA needs to do a better job of investigating claims of retaliation by managers against workers who voice concerns. TVA management agreed to implement better programs.

Unemployment rates fell in 43 U.S. states in January, including Tennessee and Georgia, as more Americans began looking for work and most quickly found jobs.

The Labor Department said Monday that the unemployment rate rose in just one state -- Iowa -- where the rate increased to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent. Still, that's far below the national rate of 6.6 percent that month.

Rates were Alabama and five other states and declined from 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent in Tennessee and from 7.6 percent to 7.4 percent in Georgia. The national jboless rate in Janaury was 6.6 percent.
