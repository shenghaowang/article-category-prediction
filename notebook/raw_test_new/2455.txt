Sally Beauty Supply Stores are the next victim in a long list of retail stores that have disclosed being hit by data breaches lately. Though the company thinks only 25,000 were hit, but why this keeps happening is the real question.

Sally Beauty Supply is a beauty supply store that sells professional beauty products usually only sold to salons, to the public. It is a publicly traded company that has over 4,000 stores in many countries.

The breach was discovered on March 5 and is believed to have only affected 25,000 customer¡¯s debit and credit card information. The company is looking into the breach with a private investigation firm and the U.S. Secret Service to make sure that the right precautions are taken to prevent future breaches and protect those whose information has already been compromised.

Security breaches on consumer information have become all too familiar lately and are making consumers wary of where they shop. Around Christmas time, Target had a large data breach into the information of their customers as well and it seemed like the breaches kept coming through ever since. What consumers once believed to be secure systems to make purchases with, have been proven otherwise in the last few months. Will new systems be put into place for retail stores to become more secure? As less and less people tend to use paper money, it is certain something needs to be done.
