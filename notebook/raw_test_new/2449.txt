NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Oracle Corporation (ORCL) is tumbling in extended trading after third-quarter earnings and sales came in below analysts' estimates.

After the bell, shares had taken off 5.4% to $36.81.

The enterprise software developer recorded revenue of $9.3 billion in the three months to February, a 4% year-over-year increase. However, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast slightly-higher sales of $9.36 billion.

Adjusted net income of 68 cents a share fell short of consensus by 2 cents.

A strengthening U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and exchange rate changes in Venezuela negatively impacted earning power, the company said in a statement.

The board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share. The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of April 8 with payment on April 29.
