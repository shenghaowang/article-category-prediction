UniCredit SpA, Italy's biggest bank, posted a record 15 billion-euro ($20.8 billion) loss in the fourth quarter after setting aside money for bad loans and writing down goodwill.

The net loss widened from 553 million euros a year earlier and exceeded the 10.6 billion-euro loss the bank reported in the third quarter of 2011. UniCredit took a charge of more than 9 billion euros on intangible assets, including goodwill writedowns at its Austrian unit, the Milan-based bank said in a statement today.

Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni plans to eliminate 8,500 jobs and sell assets to strengthen UniCredit's finances as part of a five-year plan announced today. The lender is targeting 2 billion euros of net income in 2014 as Italy begins to emerge from a recession and stricter capital requirements imposed by regulators restrain earnings. The bank set aside 9.3 billion euros for bad loans in the fourth quarter, double the amount of a year before.

"Thanks to the additional provisions booked, UniCredit now has by far the highest impaired loan coverage ratio of the Italian banking system and amongst the best in Europe, in line with pre-crisis levels," Ghizzoni, 58, said in the statement.

UniCredit rose as much as 2.2 percent, after initially declining following the release. The stock was up 2.1 percent at 6.17 euros by 3:05 p.m. in Milan trading.

The bank proposed a stock dividend of 10 cents a share for 2013, though shareholders will have the option of requesting cash. UniCredit paid a nine cent-a-share cash dividend on 2012 earnings.

UniCredit raised its bad-loan coverage ratio to 52 percent on Dec. 31 as the European Central Bank began examining the balance sheets of the euro area's largest banks.
