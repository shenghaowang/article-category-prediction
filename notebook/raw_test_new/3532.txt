Groups at Halifax Health Medical Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday will help guide the public through the enrollment process.

DAYTONA BEACH ¡ª Supporters of the president¡¯s health care law will make one last push on Sunday to sign people up for coverage before the March 31 enrollment deadline and are hoping for an appearance from Vice President Joe Biden to generate interest.

A variety of community groups, along with representatives from insurance carriers, will be at Halifax Health Medical Center from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday to guide the public through the enrollment process. Organizers have requested an appearance from Biden, but no commitments have been made. 

Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said he assisted in organizing the event because he hears often from constituents who are dealing with medical emergencies and lack insurance coverage.

¡°The intent of the event is to ensure people in middle to lower income America have access to affordable health care,¡± Henry said. ¡°We want them to be informed. This is an opportunity to enroll in insurance that will meet their needs.¡±

More than 100,000 people in Volusia and Flagler counties lack insurance coverage. Insurance plans in the federally run online marketplace ¡ª HealthCare.gov ¡ª are offered by private carriers. Government tax subsidies to make coverage more affordable are available for those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level ¡ª about $11,670 to $46,680 for an individual. Those without insurance will face a $95 penalty or 1 percent of their income ¡ª whichever is greater. Hardship exemptions are available. 

The Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida, which received funds from a federal grant to educate the public about the health care law, has requested Biden or another ¡°high-ranking official¡± appear in Daytona Beach. While first lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have touted the law elsewhere in the state, no high-ranking officials have visited locally. On Thursday, President Barack Obama visited Valencia College in Orlando to speak on women¡¯s economic issues. 

¡°I¡¯ve been really trying to bang the drum for this community,¡± said Joyce Case, who oversees enrollment counselors called navigators for the Health Planning Council. ¡°We are always neglected because of Orlando or Jacksonville. We have a very high number of uninsured in our community. We need it just as bad.¡±

Organizers would likely be given short notice if Biden or another high-ranking member of the administration decided to make an appearance, Case said. Biden recently returned to the states from a visit overseas to deal with the crisis in Ukraine, according to his public schedules. 

Florida is seen as a critical state for the success of the Affordable Care Act. It has 3.8 million uninsured residents ¡ª the second highest number of any state in the nation. The health care law has met political resistance from the Republican Party in Florida. The state Legislature declined to expand Medicaid with the help of federal dollars because of opposition in the House. 

As of March 1, 442,087 Floridians have selected a plan in the marketplace, according to the latest enrollment numbers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Case said she¡¯s noticed interest has been mounting this week as the government ramps up its advertising efforts. 

Mincy Pollock, who is helping to organize the event in Daytona Beach, said he hopes that number grows during the last week of enrollment. 

He suspects some people are intimidated by the website and the enrollment process. 

¡°We are trying to create an event that¡¯s nonthreatening ¡ª sort of fun,¡± said Pollock, general manager of Jacksonville-based First Coast Multi-Lines Agency, an insurance broker. ¡°We are going to hold their hands through the entire process.¡±

Those who miss the March 31 deadline can apply for coverage during the next open enrollment, which runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.
