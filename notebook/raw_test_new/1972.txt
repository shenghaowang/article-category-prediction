Maine's Department of Labor said Monday that the state's jobless rate dropped from 6.4 percent in December.

Officials originally estimated that December's unemployment rate was 6.2 percent, but revised it.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics says roughly 43,900 Maine residents were unemployed in January. That's 5,600 fewer unemployed Mainers than the year before.

The state's unemployment rate is down nearly 1 percent from one year ago. Maine continues to beat the U.S. unemployment rate of 6.7 percent.
