Australia is assuming the co-ordination of the search in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared over a week ago with 239 people on board.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday referred to flight MH370 as an "unfathomed mystery" when telling federal parliament he had recently spoken with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak about the search for the plane.

"In light of developments in the investigation he asked that Australia assume responsibility for coordinating that part of the search effort that is now focusing on the southern Indian Ocean," Mr Abbott said in a statement.

Mr Razak also accepted an offer of additional Australian maritime surveillance resources.

Mr Abbott said Australia will work with assets from a number of other countries, including surveillance aircraft from New Zealand and the United States.
