Bruno Guillon, the chief executive of fashion house Mulberry, has resigned ¡°with immediate effect¡±.

The store, which issued a profit warning in January, seeing shares plummet 25 per cent, will now be looking for a new leader.

Godfrey Davis, who is a current non-executive chairman and has previously been chief executive, will hold the reins until a successor is found.

Davis thanked Guillon, who¡¯s been at the helm for two years, for his work.

He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales.
