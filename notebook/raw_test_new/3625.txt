Banning Twitter in Turkey is a violation of democratic rights, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party Kemal Klcdaroglu was reported as saying on March 21, Anadolu agency reported.

"The ruling party elected by the people has no right to take such an action," he added.

 Access was blocked a few hours after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a statement about such a possibility.

He has recently said that if necessary, the agenda may include the issue of banning the use of Youtube and Facebook to protect its citizens from external influences. However Turkish President Abdullah Gul stressed the impossibility of banning their use.

The Turkish President also said that a complete ban on Twitter is out of the question.
