The coin has various faults on it and looks like it is two coins crudely put together.

It was given to an anonymous person amongst change while they were visiting the fair in Gloucester Park, Gloucester, UK.

The Royal Mint has claimed that it has seen 'no incidents at all of counterfeiting' of the new coin so far.

They have yet to confirm if this coin is indeed a production error - so its value is not yet known.
