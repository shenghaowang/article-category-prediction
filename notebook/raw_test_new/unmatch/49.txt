General Motors on Monday announced the recall of 1.5 million more vehicles, mostly crossover SUVs needing a wiring fix for side airbags.

3. Affordable Care Act sign-ups reach 5 million

ObamaCare call centers are at their busiest since December as Americans hurry to sign up for health insurance before 2014 open enrollment ends on March 31, the Department of Health and Human Services reported Monday.

4. New data strengthens Malaysia Airlines hijacking theory

U.S. officials said late Monday that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's initial turn off its course for Beijing was programmed into the Flight Management System computer, not performed manually. That suggests that someone in the cockpit with aviation training made the turn, bolstering Malaysian authorities' suspicion that the plane vanished with 239 passengers on board as the result of a criminal hijacking, not an accident.

Los Angeles was rattled awake Monday morning by a magnitude 4.4 earthquake. Passengers on some commuter trains faced delays while crews inspected tracks, but city officials received no reports of deaths, injuries, or damage.
