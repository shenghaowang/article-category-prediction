The German ZEW headline numbers for June showed that the economic sentiment numbers slumped to -24.7 versus -18.0 expectations and -16.1 last. While the sub-index current conditions figure also dropped sharply to 72.4 versus 78.2 expected and 80.6 booked previously, missing market expectations by a big margin.

ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach noted: ¡°The current survey period has been marked by great political uncertainty. In particular, fears over an escalation of the international trade war with the United States have dampened the economic outlook. The positive news regarding industrial production, incoming orders and the labour market have been greatly overshadowed by the anticipated negative effects on foreign trade.¡±

These numbers are derived via a survey of about 300 German institutional investors and analysts, conducted by the Zentrum f¨¹r Europische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW), which asks respondents to rate the relative 6-month economic outlook for Germany. Generally speaking, an optimistic view is considered as positive (or bullish) for the EUR, whereas a pessimistic view is considered as negative (or bearish).
