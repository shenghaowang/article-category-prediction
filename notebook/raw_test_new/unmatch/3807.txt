Gilead Sciences Inc. shares dropped 6% in extremely heavy Wednesday midday trade, a move that Wall Street analysts attributed to a new program introduced by UnitedHealth Group's UnitedHealthcare division that incentivizes patients to take lower-cost HIV medications. Gilead's HIV franchise has long been a powerhouse for the company, but it has faced more sluggish sales of late. The new UnitedHealth program, My ScriptRewards, allows patients on employer-based plans and, soon, self-insured individuals cost savings and up to $500 in prepaid debit cards for medical expenses when they choose a cheaper drug regimen, with the first medications included in the program being HIV antivirals. The UnitedHealth program was first announced on Monday, notably, and Gilead shares were up this week until Wednesday. The Wednesday decline was an "overreaction," RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said, adding that he remains bullish on the long-term future of the company's HIV franchise. Gilead shares have dropped 13.1% over the last three months, compared with a 3.4% decline in the S&P 500 and a 0.9% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
