MANILA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Zinc and copper prices fell in Shanghai on Wednesday after data showed that China¡¯s manufacturing sector grew at its weakest pace in more than two years, dampening the outlook for demand in the world¡¯s top metals consumer.

Amid rising headwinds from the Sino-U.S. trade row, China¡¯s official Purchasing Managers¡¯ Index dropped to 50.2 in October from 50.8 in September, only slightly above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.

The latest reading suggests a further slowing in the world¡¯s second-biggest economy and could prompt more policy support from Beijing on top of a raft of recent initiatives.

The most-traded December zinc on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 1.8 percent at 21,545 yuan ($3,093) a tonne by 0152 GMT. Copper dropped 1.4 percent to 49,160 yuan.

* LME METALS: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.1 percent at $6,039 a tonne and zinc was flat at $2,549.

* CHINA¡¯S YUAN: As China¡¯s yuan approaches the 7 to the dollar barrier, investors are betting authorities will eventually let the currency fall beyond the historic level. Yet they are just as confident that China won¡¯t allow the kind of capitulation seen in past market meltdowns.

* NYRSTAR HIT: Falling zinc prices, along with rising energy prices and higher mine operating expenses, caused third-quarter core profit at metals producer Nyrstar NV to drop 74 percent. LME zinc has lost more than 2 percent in October, on course for its eighth monthly loss in nine.

* EQUITIES, DOLLAR: Asian stocks pulled away from 20-month lows to eke out small gains, thanks to a rebound on Wall Street. The dollar hovered near 16-month highs versus a basket of its major rivals.
