Wal-Mart's success in the used video-game market remains to be seen, but its entry is significant.

"For all the concern there's been about the used video-game model as digital and online video games take share, Wal-Mart getting in validates the business model," said Oppenheimer retail analyst Brian Nagel.



"We aren't participating in the $2 billion used gaming opportunity at all right now," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters that announced the news.



According to NPD, video-game sales fell 17 percent during the most recent holiday season.

However, despite the decline, Wal-Mart said it still expects there was an inflection point in gaming with the new hardware that came out last fall, Mac Naughton said.

No doubt, Wal-Mart likely hopes the program will generate foot traffic, or help it capture a larger share of new-release game sales as those trade-in dollars are turned into sales.



But some observers said the bigger question may be the program's possible impact on competitors like GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, eBay and others that currently offer trade-in programs.

That's because the business can be lucrative. While the industry saw video-game sales fall over the holiday season, GameStop reported a 7 percent increase in used game sales for the period.

If the new video game trade-in program follows the example of Wal-Mart's current electronic trade-in programs, the value of the video game will be as competitive as the market allows.
