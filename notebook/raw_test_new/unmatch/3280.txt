June 01, 2018 (ACCESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / June 1, 2018 / U.S. markets closed sharply lower on Thursday as the U.S. decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The tariffs incited promises of retaliation by trade partners and raised fears of a potential trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.02 percent to close at 24,415.84, while the S&P 500 Index declined 0.69 percent to close at 2,705.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.27 percent to close at 7,442.12.

"The initial round of tariff threats by the Trump administration and the promises of retaliation by trade partners earlier this year were initially viewed by investors as opening gambits in negotiations that would lead to agreements," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR.
