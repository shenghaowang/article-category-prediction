General Motors Co. on Monday pushed its repair-cost estimate for auto recalls this year to $2 billion as it disclosed plans to replace potentially faulty ignition keys on 3.37 million older model cars in North America.

The move comes two days before Chief Executive Mary Barra is set to testify before a House committee on the auto maker's mishandling of an ignition switch recall involving Chevrolet Cobalts and other older models.
