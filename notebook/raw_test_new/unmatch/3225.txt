U.S. stocks notched their biggest weekly declines since Brexit, after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the case for an increase in U.S. short-term interest rates has strengthened in recent months.

The remarks, which were anxiously awaited all week, sparked an initial reaction to sell stocks that quickly reversed itself. Later in the session, stocks again fell, as investors¡¯ expectations for a rate rise later this year climbed. Treasury yields and the dollar also fluctuated before finishing the day higher.
