Around 50 family members of Chinese passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, and left through a special lane to avoid the media glare on Sunday morning.

They had asked to see Malaysia's premier Najib Razak and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein after their arrival to get more definite answers to the whereabouts of the missing jetliner and their loved ones, reported China Daily on Saturday.

The family members were seen boarding two buses, according to an airport staff.

More than 50 members of the media were misled into thinking that the families would set foot at the arrival hall, as some representatives from Malaysia Airlines and about 50 volunteers from the Malaysian Chinese Association's (MCA) crisis relief squad were waiting there since early morning. The MCA team was coordinated by Chew Mei Fun.

Mr Hishammuddin on Saturday pledged to improve communications between Malaysia Airlines and the families of those missing aboard MH370.
