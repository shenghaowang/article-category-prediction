Because Banning Propaganda ¡°Ties the Hands of America¡¯s Diplomatic Officials, Military, and Others by Inhibiting Our Ability to Effectively Communicate In a Credible Way¡±Michael Hastings reports An amendment that would legalize the use of propaganda on American audiences is being inserted into the latest defense authorization bill....The amendment would ¡°strike the current ban on domestic dissemination¡± of propaganda material produced by the State Department and the Pentagon, according to the summary of the law at the House Rules Committee's official website.The tweak to the bill would essentially neutralize two previous acts¡ªthe Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1987¡ªthat had been passed to protect U.S. audiences from our own government¡¯s misinformation campaigns.The bi-partisan amendment is sponsored by Rep. Mac Thornberry from Texas and Rep. Adam Smith from Washington State.In a little noticed press release earlier in the week ¡ª buried beneath the other high-profile issues in the $642 billion defense bill, including indefinite detention and a prohibition on gay marriage at military installations ¡ª Thornberry warned that in the Internet age, the current law ¡°ties the hands of America¡¯s diplomatic officials, military, and others by inhibiting our ability to effectively communicate in a credible way.¡±
