The benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 5.06 percent, up from 5.04 percent in the previous week, according to data from Bankrate.com¡¯s weekly survey of the nation¡¯s largest mortgage lenders. Meanwhile, the average 15-year fixed rate jumped three basis points to 4.41 percent and the average rate for a 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage slid one basis point to 4.38 percent.

The jump in rates pushed mortgage application activity down again. Total mortgage applications fell 2.5 percent from one week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association¡¯s weekly applications survey for the week ending Oct. 26. Refinance applications decreased 4 percent while purchase applications slumped by 2 percent.

¡°Purchase applications may have been adversely impacted by the recent uptick in rates and the significant stock market volatility we have seen the past couple of weeks,¡± said Joel Kan, associate vice president of economic and industry forecasts at the MBA.

With fixed rates north of 5 percent, homeowners see less value in refinancing their mortgages unless they do a cash-out refinance to consolidate debt or make home improvements. On the other hand, the ARM share of total applications rose to 7.6 percent of all applications ¡ª its highest level since May 2017. ARMs gain more popularity when rates rise because they have a lower, fixed initial rate than a 30-year fixed mortgage rate. After that time frame ends, an ARM resets to a variable rate and payments can go up or down for the remainder of the loan term.

Realtor.com: Housing inventory grows for first time in four years

The housing market added 25,000 listings in October ¡ª a growth of 2 percent ¡ª after four years of ¡°severe inventory declines,¡± according to Realtor.com¡¯s October housing report. It¡¯s the first time in four years inventory has actually grown, which is welcome news for buyers.

New listings increased 4 percent in October and were, on average, 8 percent (or $25,000) less expensive than existing inventory on the market a year ago, Realtor.com found. New listings were also 190-square-feet smaller as more listings for condos and townhomes were added to the market in October than single-family homes.

¡°Buyers have been struggling for four years to find homes in their price range, while dealing with bidding wars and multiple offer situations,¡± said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com, in a statement. ¡°The inventory increase will not solve the problem overnight, but it should provide some relief to those still in the market, especially if the growth we¡¯re seeing in more affordable homes and condos holds steady. However, affordability is still an issue with increasing mortgage rates and prices keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.¡±

The U.S. median listing price held steady at $295,000 in October, which is up 7 percent over a year ago but a smaller jump than 2017¡¯s 10 percent increase, Realtor.com reported.
