Florida's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.0 percent in October 2014 is at the lowest level in approximately six years when the June 2008 rate was also 6.0 percent.

The latest numbers are down from 6.7 percent in October 2013 and 6.1 percent in September of this year.

Santa Rosa County unemployment rate of 5.2 percent ranks 52 out of 67 Florida counties, with only 15 counties in the state having a lower unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) for October 2014. Santa Rosa County's rate continues to be lower than both the national and state unemployment rates.

Escambia County unemployment rate mirrored the state's average of 5.8 percent, which is slightly above the national average of 5.5 percent.

Last week, Governor Rick Scott announced the Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) again experienced positive annual job growth over the year in October 2014 with 2,800 new jobs. The metro area's unemployment rate declined by 0.7 percentage point over the year, from 6.3 percent in October 2013 to 5.6 percent in October 2014.

It was also announced today that Florida's private-sector businesses added 32,000 jobs in October 2014.

Governor Scott said, "With an unemployment rate down to 5.6 percent in the Pensacola metro area, it is clear that we are creating an opportunity economy in every area of our state. In October 2014, 2,800 new jobs were created in the Pensacola area, and we will not stop until every Floridian who wants a job can get one."

The industry with the largest job gains in the Pensacola metro area over the year was leisure and hospitality with 1,600 new jobs. The Pensacola metro area had the second fastest annual job growth rate in information at 9.1 percent and in leisure and hospitality at 7.9 percent in October 2014.

The Pensacola metro area had 5,251 online job openings in October 2014, an increase of 8.2 percent over the year, and 918 openings for STEM occupations, an increase of 7.1 percent over the year. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and these jobs are considered high wage and high skill.

In October, CareerSource Escarosa, along with the state's other 23 Regional Workforce Boards, reported more than 39,300 Floridians were placed in jobs. An individual who receives employment and training assistance through a One-Stop Career Center and finds a job within 180 days is deemed a placement and may be reported by a regional workforce board. Of these individuals, 8,346 previously received Reemployment Assistance. In 2013, 479,064 Floridians were placed in jobs, with 135,384 former claimants finding employment.

In addition to the 32,000 jobs added statewide in October, Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's rate since April 2012. Florida's statewide unemployment rate in October was 6.0 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from last month and down 0.7 percentage point from the October 2013 rate of 6.7 percent.

Since December 2010, Florida's unemployment rate has dropped 5.1 percentage points, from 11.1 percent down now to 6.0 percent in October 2014. Florida's unemployment rate has declined or held steady over the month for 47 of the last 50 months.

Florida's labor force increased over the month and over the year in October. On an annual basis, Florida's labor force has increased for 56 consecutive months. This economic indicator can be a sign of optimism as more people are entering the labor force with confidence in their prospects for finding employment. The labor force is defined as the sum of employment plus unemployment (those with a job and those without a job but actively seeking work).

The long-term positive trends in the unemployment rate and job counts are among the most important economic indicators to consider when analyzing the health of Florida's economic recovery. The state's private-sector job counts have been steadily on the rise for over four years, showing that Florida's businesses are responding to the state's improving economic climate. Since December 2010, the state has added 679,000 private-sector jobs.
