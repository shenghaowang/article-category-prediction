The U.S. Justice Department extracted a record $1.2 billion criminal penalty from Toyota Motor Corp. for misleading consumers about safety problems and sounded a strong warning to General Motors Co., now in prosecutors' cross hairs.

The penalty is the largest to date against an auto maker and ends a four-year criminal probe into Toyota's efforts to conceal and play down safety issues before government regulators and consumers. In 2010, a government regulator found that those safety issues had caused at least five deaths.
