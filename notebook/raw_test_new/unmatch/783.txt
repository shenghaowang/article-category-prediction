Toyota is poised to pay more than $1 billion to settle a criminal investigation into disclosures around the sudden acceleration of its vehicles, a steep fine that caps a multiyear inquiry and provides a template for the authorities pursuing a similar case against General Motors.

While the government¡¯s deal with Toyota is not yet final, it could be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to a person briefed on the matter. The Justice Department has scheduled a news conference for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.

The settlement ¡ª which could also include a so-called deferred prosecution agreement in which the Justice Department would suspend an indictment so long as Toyota agreed to correct its missteps ¡ª would represent a victory for the government. It is rare to extract such a significant fine from an automaker, let alone in a criminal context.

A Toyota spokesman, Keisuke Kirimoto, said that no final deal had been reached. ¡°Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney¡¯s office on this matter for more than four years. During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and more consumer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements,¡± Mr. Kirimoto said by phone.
