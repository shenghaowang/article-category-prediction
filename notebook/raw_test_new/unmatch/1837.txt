Bill Hemmer was interviewing aviation attorney Salvatore Lagonia Wednesday morning about the missing Malaysia Airlines plane when he brought up a question that very well may have been on the minds of a least a few Fox News viewers. Given that it took ¡°100 years to find the Titanic¡± and ¡°2,000 years to find Noah¡¯s Ark, do we ever find Flight 370?¡±

The Fox host was apparently referring to the evangelical Christian explorers who claimed to have found the remains of the biblical Noah¡¯s Ark on Turkey¡¯s Mount Ararat during explorations in 2007 and 2008. ¡°It¡¯s not 100 percent that it is Noah¡¯s ark, but we think it is 99.9 percent that this is it,¡± Yeung Wing-cheung, a Chinese filmmaker accompanying the explorers, said in 2010.

However, even FoxNews.com publicized the finding as a ¡°hoax¡± at the time. ¡°Maybe the find on Mount Ararat in Turkey really is Noah¡¯s Ark,¡± Fox¡¯s Lauren Green wrote. ¡°More likely, it isn¡¯t. But if it isn¡¯t, that won¡¯t stop Ark enthusiasts from believing it is out there somewhere.¡±

¡°I think we find flight 370 much sooner than those two things, thank God,¡± Hemmer¡¯s guest told him. ¡°Until then, I think it¡¯s the greatest reality show in the world.¡±
