SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) ¡ª GameStop Corp. was a notable loser in the S&P 500 on Tuesday amid concerns that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. may threaten its hold on the used videogame market while Microsoft Corp. rose on a price target hike.

GameStop GME, +1.69% shares dropped 3.1%. The move came after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +0.76% said it would allow customers to hand in used videogames in exchange for gift cards, which can be used in its retail stores or online. The change in policy from Wal-Mart Stores could eat away at GameStop¡¯s dominance of the $2 billion used videogame market in the U.S. Wal-Mart shares are up marginally.

Microsoft MSFT, +0.23% shares rose 4.3%. Analysts at Barclays hiked the stock¡¯s price target to $44 from $43. ¡°Microsoft is arguably the leader in the cloud services market with Windows Azure and Office 365. It can drive better earnings growth as it transitions its ubiquitous on-premise install bases (Office and Windows Server) to its cloud platforms,¡± analyst Raimo Lenschow said in a report. Barclays rates the stock at overweight.

NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +0.00% shares fell 3.1%. The exchange operator will host an investor¡¯s day on March 27. Analysts from Jefferies who recently met with Nasdaq executives said the management is upbeat about Nasdaq OMX NLX, its derivatives platform.

Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. KORS, +1.59% slid 2.2%. Analysts at Barclays initiated coverage of the U.S. luxury sector with a positive industry outlook but Michael Kors was issued an underweight rating.

Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ, +0.57% shares added 3.7%. The stock¡¯s rating was raised to overweight from equalweight and its price target hiked to $38 versus $33 at Barclays on Tuesday.

SanDisk Corp. US:SNDK shares gained 4.4%. The stock will be added to the NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index on March 24. The index is composed of 100 tech and telecommunications companies that regularly pay a dividend.

Shares of United States Steel Corp. X, +2.94% rose 5.3%. Analysts at Nomura lowered U.S. Steel¡¯s first-quarter earnings-per-share outlook to 35 cents from 40 cents. The stock is rated a buy with a target price of $32. The stock is down 14% year to date.

TSLA: Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, +0.62% rose 2.3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the stock¡¯s six-month price target to $200, which is still below its current trading level of $239.

MSG: Madison Square Garden Co. MSG, -3.38% shares are up 0.8%. The entertainment company said Tuesday that it named Phil Jackson, one of the successful coaches in the NBA history, as president of the New York Knicks. Jackson won two championships as a player with the Knicks in 1970 and 1973. He also coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles and the Los Angeles Lakers to five titles.

HTZ: Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ, +1.58% shares edged up 0.1%. The company said Tuesday it received board approval to proceed with a spinoff of its equipment-rental business that is expected to close by early next year. The new company will be called HERC, the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, while Hertz will retain the rental-car businesses. Hertz said it will receive about $2.5 billion in proceeds from the spinoff that will be used to pay down debt and fund a new $1 billion stock buyback program.

At the same time, Hertz said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed as revenue rose to $2.56 billion, with its adjusted per-share earnings coming in at 26 cents. But results fell short of analyst expectations compiled by FactSet.

THC: Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, +1.84% rose 1.6%. Analysts at Mizuho said they would be buyers of hospital stocks like Tenet due to the sector¡¯s recent weakness on changes related to individual mandate exemption rules and earnings. ¡°We do not think either issue will have a meaningful negative impact on our EPS estimates for the hospital group,¡± the analysts said in a note. Shares of Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, -0.02% climbed 3.4% and HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -0.92% advanced 2.2%.
