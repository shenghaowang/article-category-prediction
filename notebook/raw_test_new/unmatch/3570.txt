That is where the Seabed Constructor is now heading.

Ocean Infinity describes itself as a technology company specializing in collecting high-resolution geophysical seabed data. The Seabed Constructor can use up to eight unmanned submarines, known as autonomous underwater vehicles, which can operate independently and at depths of nearly 20,000 feet.

The company says the use of the untethered, deep-diving vehicles means it can search large areas of the ocean floor quickly and effectively.

¡°Whilst there can be no guarantees of locating the aircraft, we believe our system of multiple autonomous vehicles working simultaneously is well-suited to the task at hand,¡± said Ocean Infinity¡¯s chief executive, Oliver Plunkett.

Many of the victims¡¯ families have urged the authorities to continue the search and determine what happened to their loved ones. The state-owned Malaysia Airlines, Boeing and Rolls-Royce, the maker of the plane¡¯s engines, also have a stake in figuring out why the aircraft disappeared.

But aviation experts say that finding the wreckage is not likely to answer the question of what went wrong. In particular, it is unlikely that any information could be retrieved from the plane¡¯s cockpit voice recorder. Even if it functioned after years deep under water, the recorder operates on a loop, and the crucial early part of the flight when the aircraft altered course would have been erased.

In concluding the earlier search, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it was ¡°almost inconceivable¡± and ¡°societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era¡± for a commercial airliner to disappear and for the world not to know what happened.

Mr. Liow, the Malaysian transportation minister, said finding the aircraft remained a priority for the Malaysian government.

¡°I would like to reiterate our unwavering commitment towards solving the mystery¡± of the missing plane, he said in prepared remarks.
