NEW YORK, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks posted solid gains Thursday, as investor sentiment was buoyed by dovish remarks from European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 320.55 points, or 1.87 percent, to 17,489.16. The S&P 500 jumped 33.57 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,052.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 79.93 points, or 1.65 percent, to 4,920.05.

The ECB decided at Thursday's meeting that the interests rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05 percent, 0.30 percent and -0.20 percent, respectively.

"The asset purchases are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favorable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households," said Draghi at a press conference held after the meeting.

He said the degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be "re-examined" at the December monetary policy meeting as euro area domestic demand remains resilient.

Some analysts thought that Draghi's comments suggested the ECB is prepared to undertake further stimulus for the euro zone.
