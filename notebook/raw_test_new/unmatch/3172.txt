It¡¯s true that in Crimea people speak Russian .Nobody and never kill them It¡¯s a big lie They wanted to join Russia because, Russia pay retired people more than Ukraine .

There are some nationalist in western part of Ukraine but they are not Nazi But if you google there are much more Nazi organizations in Russia than anywhere else

Crimea was a part of Ukraine till 2014, and then Russia annexed it .

They destroy all these themselves till 2014. They really live very similar one of my friend explained me she studied at the university in Russia ( at that time we were one country ), so I have many friends and relatives there But since 2014 we don¡¯t communicate with Russian friends and very little with relatives They are afraid to communicate with us because they have very strict censor First it was very painful for her but now it¡¯s ok she tried to throw away them from mind to speak Russian because it¡¯s her native language in this region ! She read books in Russian Of course can speak and read Ukrainian but not so easily like Russian, watch movies in both languages half of TV (Television) programs are in Russian there till 2014. She watched Russian TV, but don¡¯t want to, because they are crazy aggressive people, they can¡¯t think themselves after watching their TV they are like zombies.

Is there a nationalist party in parliament in Ukraine? Only 1% of people voted for this party that¡¯s why no nationalists in parliament now.

Russian, they even had a plan to take Crimea earlier in 1997 I read their plan armed rebellion in Crimea I can give you the link to this article (it¡¯s in Russian) You can send her and ask what she thinks about it.

Russia never has been a democratic country.

What are the reasons of wars in Chechnya About the reasons beslan and nord¡¯ost Chechnya wanted to be separated from Russia, they asked to stop war in their place, but Russia bombed their cities, ruined completely them.

There is a communist party there, but these communists only have the name, they are very rich. Russian also voted for that But in reality the authorities do not allow other people to come to the parliament They don¡¯t allow protest meetings ,if people more then one go with protest placards, the police put them into prison They killed leaders of opposition . They even suggest sometimes making Putin a king (tzar in Russian) I¡¯m not kidding, Putin is the richest person in the world.

Russian, they need Crimea because they rent Sevastopol (which is in Crimea) port for their submarine navy because it has very beautiful nature,

Then they attacked Donbass, the region where Mariupol , several times they attacked City because Mariupol is on the way to Crimea If you look at the map, Russia has no borders with Crimea on land, that¡¯s why they want to take some more territories .

Sevastopol is the best deep port for submarines.

Novorossiysk is a port city on the Black Sea in southern Russia. Krasnodar is not at the sea Novorossiysk is a big port for navy ,but it¡¯s not deep enough for submarines . the red line was the border between Ukraine and Russia till 2014.

therefore black sea in Russians hands now . Russian want blacksea not ukraine . §¿§Õ§å§Ñ§â§Õ §­§Ú§Þ§à§ß§à§Ó. §³§è§Ö§ß§Ñ§â§Ú§Û §Ó§à§à§â§å§Ø§Ö§ß§ß§à§Ô§à §Ó§à§ã§ã§ä§Ñ§ß§Ú§ñ. §³§ä§Ñ§ä§î§ñ §¢§Ý§à§Ô§Ú / §ª§Ô§à§â§î §¿§Û§Õ§Þ§Ñ§ß: §²§Ö§è§Ö§á§ä, §á§à §Ü§à§ä§à§â§à§Þ§å §Ò§í§Ý§Ñ §ã§á§â§à§Ó§à§è§Ú§â§à§Ó§Ñ§ß§Ñ §Ó§à§Û§ß§Ñ §Ó §µ§Ü§â§Ñ§Ú§ß§Ö , 1954 transfer of Crimea - Wikipedia
