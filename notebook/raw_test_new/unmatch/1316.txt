GameStop Corp., many consumers¡¯ go-to for classics like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, may continue to struggle this year as Walmart Inc. wades into a lesser known product line: collectibles.

Walmart announced it is rolling out its own dedicated section of ¡° collectibles,¡± essentially, pop culture merchandise. The items will hit shelves the week of October 15, just in time for Halloween. The major retailer is partnering with Loot Crate, a collectibles subscription service, McFarlane Toys and CultureFly. They¡¯ll also sell Funko merchandise -- an area where GameStop is counted as one of the toy manufacturer¡¯s top retailers.

¡°Gamestop will no doubt remain the destination for collectibles but we don¡¯t see how this announcement doesn¡¯t hurt growth and could likely be a headwind for overall traffic and game sales,¡± wrote Bank of America¡¯s Curtis Nagle in an analyst note. GameStop shares are down nearly 17 percent this year.

¡°This is not the first time Walmart has tried to encroach on GameStop¡¯s territory,¡± Nagle said. The retailer tried, unsuccessfully, to build a used gaming business several times.

GameStop arguably revolutionized the video game industry when it launched its buy-sell-trade program in 2000.
