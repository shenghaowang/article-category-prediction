Yet another retailer is fessing-up with some details of a data snafu.

Sally Beauty, one of the world's largest retailers of professional beauty products, is reporting that a security breach discovered on March 5, affected fewer than 25,000 a credit and debit card accounts.

The Denton, Texas-based seller of beauty supplies says it is pursuing its investigation with a forensics firm and says that it's working with the U.S. Secret Service.

"We take this criminal activity very seriously," the company said in a statement. "We continue to work diligently with Verizon on this investigation and are taking necessary actions and precautions to mitigate and remediate the issues caused by this security incident. In addition, we are working with the United States Secret Service on their preliminary investigation into the matter."

WHAT TO DO: Protecting yourself from identity theft

For the nation's retailers, data breaches have become an explosive issue -- and a driver of serious consumer angst -- since Target reported a massive security breach shortly before Christmas. Other major retailers, including Neiman Marcus, have reported data breaches since the holiday season.

It's become a key concern for consumers, and some recent reports even show the data snafu may be cutting into customer traffic at Target stores as some concerned customers shop elsewhere.

Sally Beauty currently owns and operates more than 2,800 Sally Beauty Supply stores worldwide, including stores in every state in the United States; Puerto Rico and Canada. Sally Beauty Supply offers over 6,000 professional quality products for hair, skin and nails to retail customers and salon professionals.

The company has loyalty discount programs, such as the Beauty Club Card, for non-professional customers and the Sally ProCard for professional customers.
