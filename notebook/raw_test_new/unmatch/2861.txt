I like to think that people are people, no matter who they are or what they do. I guess there are many things to factor in here. First of all there is the time factor. Many celebs have grueling work schedules. Filming, recording, touring, interviews and all the things they do on a daily basis leaves little time for chit chat. 

The second factor may be the sheer volume of messages they receive. Replying to all of them would be a full time job.

Another factor could be reputation management. With social media being such a public forum, and with them being under such close scrutiny, it is hard for them to feel free to be themselves. Everything they send out is considered part of the public domain and there are many people just waiting to catch them out. In such a circumstance, I would not want to participate online, nor wish to expose my family, friends and loved ones to scrutiny.

Of course who can tell why people do anything they do :)
