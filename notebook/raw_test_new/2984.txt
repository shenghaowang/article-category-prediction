MtGox, formerly the world¡¯s largest bitcoin exchange, has found around 200,000 bitcoins worth $116m in an old digital wallet.

The troubled exchange, which has filed for bankruptcy after a series of large thefts, had lost up to 850,000 bitcoins. This find brings the total down to 650,000.

¡°MtGox had certain old-format wallets which were used in the past and which, MtGox thought, no longer held any bitcoins,¡± said MtGox chief executive Mark Karpeles in the bankruptcy filing, where the find was revealed.

However, ¡°on March 7, 2014, MtGox confirmed that an old-format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 bitcoins,¡± he said.

The total number of bitcoins stolen equates to around 7% of all the bitcoins in existence.
