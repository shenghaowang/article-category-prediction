The proposed merger of Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) is drawing regulatory scrutiny.

Sources tell Reuters that the attorneys general of a number of states are working with the U.S Department of Justice to review how the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger will affect the market for broadband Internet service.

Regulators are reviewing the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger to see if it complies with antitrust laws. The number of states that have joined in the federal review isn¡¯t know, but Indiana is reportedly conducting its own evaluation of the Comcast-Time Warner cable merger¡¯s impact.

Comcast has said it will shed 3 million cable TV subscribers to keep its share of the pay TV market under 30% in a bid to appease regulators. The Comcast-Time Warner cable merger must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission before it can go forward.

The $45 billion Comcast-Time Warner cable merger, announced last month, has drawn criticism that it will reduce competition, translating into higher charges to consumers.

CMCSA stock fell almost 1% in Wednesday morning trading, while TWC stock slipped slightly.
