MtGox, the major Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, has said in a statement that they have found 200,000 of their missing bitcoins.

The coins were found in an old digital wallet from 2011, and have a value of about $115 million.Despite the major find, the company is still missing 650,000 of its own and customer's bitcoins. said Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles,To avoid having the new find stolen by hackers, the coins were moved to offline wallets this week.Hackers have stolen the rest of the coins, which amount to about 7 percent of all bitcoins ever mined.
