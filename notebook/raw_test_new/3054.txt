Used games are big business for video games stores and more general retailers including Amazon and Best Buy have also got in on the action due to the potential for profit. And now another well-known name is entering the field: Walmart.

Walmart will next week launch its Video Game Trade-In program as part of its Gamecenter offering in-store. But why would you choose to trade-in at Walmart over visiting a dedicated games retailer? Because Walmart will take your games in return for a gift card, meaning you can use the cash to purchase anything in-store, online, or at Sam¡¯s Club.

While such an offer may not be too appealing for gamers looking to buy more games, it¡¯s certainly going to be of interest to parents, or someone looking to offload their games collection with no intention of embracing next-gen consoles just yet.

Walmart also wants to attract gamers who desire more games, though, so it¡¯s promising to pay more for your used games while offering to sell new and used games cheaper. If they can pay more than other retailers, then Walmart will certainly do well, but we¡¯ll have to wait until the service officially launches on March 26 to see how much better their prices are.

Although Walmart intends to start buying used games from customers from Wednesday next week, it looks like we may be waiting a while to see them reappear for sale on store shelves. A ¡°Certified Pre-Owned¡± collection of games is planned, but it won¡¯t become available until the summer. If you¡¯re wondering what the certification means, Walmart claims each game will be refurbished and sold ¡°like-new.¡±
