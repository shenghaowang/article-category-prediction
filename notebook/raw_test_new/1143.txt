After 15 hours of taking part in a non-stop relay yesterday, runners still found the energy to take part in a mass dance workout. More than 6,500 people joined the Singapore Cancer Society-TalkMed Relay for Life which began on Saturday night at the National Stadium and ended there on the morning of march 11, 2018.
