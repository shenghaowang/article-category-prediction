_iNVEZZ.com: Monday, March 18th:_ The Center for European Economic Research ZEW today released its Indicators of Economic Sentiment for Germany and the Eurozone, the prints for both of which showed larger-than-expected declines this month.

The German measure fell to a six-month low of 46.6 from February¡¯s 55.7, whereas analysts had been expecting a drop to 52.8. A reading above zero indicates optimism.

¡°In this month¡¯s survey the Crimea crisis is weighing on experts¡¯ economic expectations for Germany,¡± observes ZEW president Prof. Dr. Clemens Fuest. ¡°Nevertheless, the indicator¡¯s level suggests that the economic upswing is currently not at risk.¡±

ABN Amro Bank economist Aline Schuiling notes that ¡°despite its decline, the ZEW indicator remains well above its long-term average value and at a level consistent with strong growth of the German economy¡±.

The measure of expert assessment of the current economic situation in Germany climbed 1.3 points to 51.3 points, ZEW reported.

Investor confidence ¡°has been near record levels, and it could have reached a cyclical high,¡± notes Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet. ¡°It would suggest that the German economy may find it difficult to re-accelerate from here, especially if foreign demand continues to slow down.¡±

Separately, ZEW¡¯s Eurozone Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell to its lowest reading since December at 61.5 points, down from 68.5 in February and grossly undershooting expectations for 67.3.

In trading so far today, the EUR/GBP has reached its highest point since 27 December at 0.8388, rising for a third consecutive trading day. At press time, the pair is changing hands at 08382, up 0.15 percent from the day¡¯s opening price.

The price action is close to its descending 200-day simple moving average, currently positioned at 0.8394 and which may provide resistance.
