The national pizza chain Sbarro -- which has locations in shopping malls and outlet centers in Birmingham, Huntsville and Florence -- has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years, Reuters news service reported earlier today.

Sbarro is struggling with too much debt and with fewer customers in the malls that house many of its restaurants, according to the Reuters report.

Under a "pre-packaged" Chapter 11 reorganization, the Melville, N.Y.-based company should make a "quick exit" from bankruptcy before May 7, the company said today, according to Reuters.

Founded in 1956, Sbarro has tried to increase sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor other fast-casual restaurant chains, Reuters reported.

An "unprecedented decline in mall traffic" and an "unsustainable" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, Sbarro chief financial officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing.

Sbarro has locations at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, at the Outlet Shops of Grand River in Leeds, at Parkway Place in Huntsville and at Regency Square Mall in Florence, according to the company's website.

It is not yet known how Sbarro's bankruptcy will affect those locations, but according to Reuters, the company said it recently closed more than 180 restaurants, and expects to close about 50 more. The bankruptcy will not affect 582 locations that are owned by franchisees.
