Boeing's design and manufacture of its cutting-edge 787 jetliner is safe despite the many problems encountered since the plane's rollout, according to a report issued jointly Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration and the aircraft maker.

The review concluded the aircraft was soundly designed, met its intended safety level and that the manufacturer and the FAA had effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta asked for the review after a lithium-ion battery caught fire on a 787 parked at Logan International Airport in Boston. A battery aboard another 787 failed less than two weeks later.

JPMorgan said Wednesday it is selling its physical commodities business for $3.5 billion, after new regulations crimped its ability to control power plants, warehouses and oil refineries.

If approved by regulators, the deal would put the commodities business in the hands of energy and commodities trading company Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

Big banks have long profited from price swings in metals, energy and other commodities. But some had branched out into owning physical facilities as well. Last summer, JPMorgan said the possibility of new regulations on whether banks could continue to do that was a factor in its decision to sell some of its physical commodities business.

FedEx Corp. said its latest quarterly profit rose 5 percent from a year ago, despite storms that raised the company's costs.

The company's ground-shipping segment is doing better, but the express-delivery business is flat and customers continue to shift to slower, cheaper services for international shipments.

The quarter's results were below analysts' expectations. The weak quarter drove FedEx to lower its profit forecast for the year.

Starbucks turned its shareholders meeting into an episode of the Oprah Winfrey show on Wednesday.

The celebrity talk show host appeared on stage to announce a drink called the Oprah Chai that will be sold at Starbucks cafes starting April 29. The drink will also be available at the small chain of Teavana tea shops Starbucks recently bought.

The splashy move comes as Starbucks Corp. looks to tap into tea as a new sales driver. Starbucks cafes are still enjoying strong sales growth, but the company is also facing intensifying competition as fast-food chains and others crowd the coffee market.

Plain old Cheerios are no longer made with genetically modified ingredients, but the switch hasn't yet translated to a boost in sales.

General Mills, the company that makes the cereal, announced in January it would start making its plain Cheerios without GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. The move came after a campaign by the group Green America, which prompted fans to express their support.

On Wednesday, CEO Ken Powell said the company has gotten supportive letters and online comments for its decision but hasn't detected a sales lift.
