NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock indexes declined for a fourth day and copper dipped to near four-year lows before rebounding on Wednesday as worries about China¡¯s economic slowdown intensified.

The concerns over China also pressured the Chilean peso and other currencies closely linked to commodities markets, while increasing investor appetite for safe-haven assets boosted U.S. government bonds and gold.

The moves follow China¡¯s first domestic bond default, which has raised concerns about a possible unraveling of the many loan deals which have used copper as collateral.

Chinese firms that have difficulty raising loans have often bought copper as security for funds they borrow, but the 14 percent drop in copper¡¯s value this year is making banks more wary about the practice.

Data, including China¡¯s recent weak export numbers, has underscored worries that the world¡¯s second-largest economy is slowing. This has added to strains on emerging markets already hit by the U.S. Federal Reserve¡¯s decision to scale back its economic stimulus.

¡°People are reluctant to make big bets right now,¡± said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York. ¡°People are just reducing their short position in emerging market exposure.¡±

¡°Most people are still cautious so we can¡¯t expect a quick rebound,¡± said Andrey Kryuchenkov, analyst at VTB Capital. ¡°On a fundamental point of view we have to wait and see in the second quarter how China stimulates its economy.¡±
