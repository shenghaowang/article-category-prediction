The Bayou State set a record in January with an unemployment rate the lowest since 2008 and with 25,000 more people employed than the year prior. It was the fifth straight month that unemployment fell in Louisiana.

In January, 1,990,531 people were employed in Louisiana, helping lower the state's unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, according to figures released from state labor officials.

Seasonally adjusted data released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that there were 25,787 more people employed this January than were employed in January 2013; while there were 102,47 people unemployed, translating to 29,310 fewer people not working the year earlier. BLS surveyed 750 households to compile the figures.

The national unemployment rate for January was at 6.6 percent.

In January, Louisiana's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was at its lowest since September 2008 and lowest in the 17-state southern region, where 6.2 percent was the average rate.

The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved in every parish and in all eight metropolitan areas for January 2014. Baton Rouge's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent, from 7.1 percent the year prior. New Orleans' rate decreased to 5.1 percent, down from 7.2 percent in January 2013.

"2014 is picking up right where 2013 left off," said Curt Eysink, executive director of the Louisiana Workforce Commission in a statement. "Our labor markets are strong and we expect employment will continue to increase as billions of dollars of new projects ramp up during the next three or four years."
