Defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has found nearly a quarter of the bitcoins it previously reported missing in an old digital file.

The Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy last month after 750,000 of its customers¡¯ bitcoins and 100,000 of its own bitcoins went missing.

In the course of reviewing its books, the exchange claims to have stumbled on 200,000 bitcoins (worth about $119 million) in an online wallet that had not been used since June 2011 according to a document released Thursday.

Bitcoins are virtual coins-not real coins. And bitcoin wallets are digital files storing the code that allows users to access their bitcoins.

Mt. Gox found the lost wallet on March 7 then reported the discovery to attorneys and moved the bitcoins to offline storage.

The discovery reduces the number of ¡°missing¡± bitcoins that led to the Mt. Gox shutdown from 850,000 to 650,000.

Also on Thursday, a Chicago U.S. District Court judge presiding over a class action against Mt. Gox gave the plaintiff¡¯s lawyers permission to track 180,000 bitcoins they say were transferred piecemeal into accounts held by Mt. Gox executives.

The Bitcoin community was abuzz with speculation that Mt. Gox was behind the mysterious transfer of 180,000 bitcoins on March 7. Mt Gox¡¯s discovery of the lost wallet with almost the same amount on that same day has further raised suspicions.

¡°Today in court we got relief ¡­ specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we¡¯ve been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it ¡°found¡± these bitcoins ¡­ it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins,¡± Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson,¡± told Reuters.

Edelson is representing Illinois resident Gregory Greene who was unable to withdraw his bitcoins from his Mt. Gox account when the exchange abruptly shut down on February 7 . Not long after, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in both Japan and the U.S.

Created in 2009, Bitcoin is a popular virtual currency traded anonymously online without banks acting as middlemen. It isn¡¯t tied to any country or controlled by a central bank, but it can be cashed in for dollars and other official currencies.
