The website has cashed in on the rise of the ¡°sharing economy¡±

A website that offers homes for rent is understood to be embarking on a fundraising that could value it at $10 billion ¡ª more than some of the established hotel chains it competes against.

The new money would catapult Airbnb into the ranks of the world¡¯s most valuable start-ups, along with the likes of WhatsApp, which was snapped up last month by Facebook for $19 billion, and Dropbox, the online storage provider that was recently valued at $10 billion.

Airbnb operates by putting travellers seeking a place to stay in contact with people with a house or room to rent. TPG, the private-equity firm, is likely to lead the funding round, which could raise between $400 and $500 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.
