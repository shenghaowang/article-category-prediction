President Abdullah Gul spoke out Friday against complete bans imposed on social media platforms, placing himself at odds with Prime Minister Recep Erdogan. The split comes as Erdogan is embroiled in a corruption scandal, which could threaten the ruling party's performance in upcoming elections. Erdogan, who pushed through the Twitter ban, has said he doesn't care what the international community has to say about the measure.
