Mulberry chief executive Bruno Guillon has stepped down from his role at the British luxury brand after two years.

His departure comes just two months after Mulberry issued a profit warning following a fall in UK retail revenues over the Christmas period.

Godfrey Davis, who is currently non-executive chairman and was previously chief executive, will become executive chairman until a successor is found.

Davis said: ¡°I, along with the board, would like to thank Bruno for his hard work over the past two years. He has helped improve the quality of the Mulberry offering and enabled the company to increase its international appeal and grown international retail sales. I am confident that Mulberry has the heritage, brand appeal and products to build on what has been achieved.¡±

Since Guillon joined the business in 2012 Mulberry has issued three profit warnings. In January Guillon said ¡°tough trading conditions over the Christmas period which saw significant discounting across the market,¡± led to lower sales from Mulberry.
