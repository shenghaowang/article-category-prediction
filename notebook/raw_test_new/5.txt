KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  When someone at the controls calmly said the last words heard from the missing Malaysian jetliner, one of the Boeing 777s communication systems already had been disabled, authorities said yesterday, adding to suspicions that at least one of the pilots was involved in the disappearance of the flight.

Investigators also examined a flight simulator confiscated from the home of one pilot and dug through the background of all 239 people on board, as well as the ground crew that serviced the plane.

The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.

Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems  the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS  about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jets engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.

The fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the planes disappearance was deliberate.

Yesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit  All right, good night  were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.

Air force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.

The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.

The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort, he said. It has now become even more difficult.

The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the planes final movements.

In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBCs Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.

Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABCs This Week that so far theres nothing out there indicating its terrorists.

Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?

Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities didnt see the necessity in the early stages.

Police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.

Malaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.

Even though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last ping was sent out at 8:11 a.m.  7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.

While many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to ping when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.

Whoever disabled the planes communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.

Zaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.
