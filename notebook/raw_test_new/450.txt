Vodafone has placed a big bet on the recovery of the Spanish economy by agreeing to buy Ono, a high-speed broadband provider, for 6 billion.

The acquisition is the British company¡¯s first major play since selling its American joint venture to Verizon Wireless for 84 billion last September ¡ª a deal that left Vodafone with a war chest of up to 24 billion.

The latest deal, which has been in Vodafone¡¯s sights since January, continues a rapid consolidation in the European telecoms industry. Vivendi last week said that it was entering exclusive talks with Numericable, the French cable company, over the sale of SFR, the mobile operator . A deal could be worth 11 billion.

Ono is the market leader for high-speed broadband in Spain¡­
