The UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, today dipped into his pocket and displayed a new 12-sided 1 coin, the coin's first redesign in 30 years. It is, supposedly, the world's most secure coin.

The new design will apparently cut down on fraud, said to cost millions of British pounds each year, thanks to its Integrated Secure Identification System (iSIS) tech. The Royal Mint actually thinks that around 45 million 1 coins in the UK, in pockets and down the backs of sofas everywhere, are actually forgeries.

The Queen's visage is still on the "head" side of the coin, but it's up to the UK public to decide what makes it to the other side. I can't wait to see the myriad of ways goatse is suggested for tails. [Reuters]
