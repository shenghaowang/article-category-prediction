The Indiana Department of Workforce Development says that Indiana's jobless rate for January fell four-tenths of a percentage point from the month before and that is down from 7.9-percent in January 2012. Indiana's unemployment rate is now below the national rate of 6.6 percent.

What does a 6.4 percent unemployment rate mean? It means that about 210,000 Hoosiers were looking for jobs in January.
