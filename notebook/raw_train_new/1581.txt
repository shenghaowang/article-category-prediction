Gold surged 1.3 per cent overnight, hitting a near six-month high as fears of more corporate defaults in China and the geopolitical tug-of-war between Russia, Ukraine and the West boosted bullion's appeal as an insurance against riskier assets.

China's first bond default and weak data on exports have stoked concerns about the health of the world's second-biggest economy, sending London copper prices to their lowest in 44 months. Copper is often put up as collateral for lending.

Fears that China's economy, the world's second largest after the United States, is slowing triggered gold buying and dampened demand for riskier assets such as equities.

"For these last sessions, we have had a very definitiveChina-led safe-haven bid," said Frank McGhee, head preciousmetals dealer at Chicago commodities brokerage Alliance Financial.

"Gold benefits from China's bond default and the industrial metals are getting whacked on the anticipation that China is slowing much quicker than people thought," he said.

Spot gold gained 1.4 per cent to $1,367.88 an ounce, having reached as high as $1,370.60, the loftiest since September 20.
