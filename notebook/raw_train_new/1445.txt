(Reuters) - Teen apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc (URBN.O) reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales, citing severe winter weather in the United States, and said it was ¡°very cautious¡± on its current-quarter performance.

Shares of the company, known for its Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters brands, fell 3 percent in extended trading.

The company¡¯s overall same-store sales, which include online sales, rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter ended January 31.

However, comparable sales in the Urban Outfitters chain fell 9 percent as its merchandise failed to impress shoppers and severe winter weather dented traffic to its stores.

The brand contributed 43 percent to the company¡¯s total sales in the quarter.

Urban Outfitters¡¯ total sales rose 6 percent to $906 million, but came below the average analyst estimate of $925.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

¡°I believe that current quarter sales at the Urban (Outfitters) brand will remain well below those achieved in the first quarter last year and margins will likely be under considerable pressure,¡± Chief Executive Richard Hayne said on a conference call with analysts.

The company¡¯s net income rose 7.4 percent to $88.7 million, or 59 cents per share, from $82.5 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected 54 cents per share.

Urban Outfitters¡¯ shares were down at $36.75 in trading after the bell. The stock closed at $37.51 on the Nasdaq on Monday.
