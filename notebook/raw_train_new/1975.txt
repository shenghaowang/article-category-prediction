Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said as long as there remains a "glimmer of hope" China will not stop the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines jet.

"This is an international and large-scale search operation involving many countries," he said. "The Chinese government has asked the relevant party to enhance coordination, investigate the cause, locate the missing plane as quickly as possible and properly handle all related matters."

It is the sixth day of the search for the flight, which went missing flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and China has dispatched multiple aircraft, ships and satellite in the multinational search mission.
