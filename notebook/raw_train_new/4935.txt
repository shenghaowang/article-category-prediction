MUNICH, March 19 (Reuters) - BMW on Wednesday said it expects record car sales and a rise in pretax profit in 2014, if political and economic conditions remain stable.

¡°We expect group profit before tax to rise significantly in the current year, despite ongoing volatile business conditions,¡± BMW¡¯s Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said at the company¡¯s annual results press conference.

The Munich-based owner of the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW brands reiterated it aims to achieve a significant rise in sales volume in 2014, after it delivered a record 1.96 million cars in 2013.

Last week BMW reported its automotive division¡¯s fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped 14 percent to 1.77 billion euros ($2.46 billion), beating analyst expectations of 1.68 billion euros. (Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Victoria Bryan)
