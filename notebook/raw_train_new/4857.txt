Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) signed a bill this week that allows school nurses to treat students with nonsmokable marijuana, according to The Denver Post.

Colorado law already allowed parents to give their children medical marijuana at school, but the new legislation now gives parents the right to bring the medicine to a school nurse's office for a child who possesses a medical marijuana card.

The report notes that school nurses can only administer medical marijuana to students whose parents have given them permission.

Hickenlooper said in a letter that he signed House Bill 1286 due to the protections in it that ensure medical marijuana will not ¡°end up in the hands of other students.¡± The law mandates that medical marijuana be stored in locked storage containers and that a parent and school principle reach a written agreement.

It also requires parents to give school nurses a doctor's note that includes instructions on dosage and timing.

The Post reports that Hickenlooper said parents' advocacy for a bill like this one was "very compelling.¡±

Colorado is one of the more progressive states in the country with regards to marijuana legislation, and in 2012 the state legalized recreational use of it.
