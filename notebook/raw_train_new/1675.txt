HONG KONG, March 17 ¡ª A gauge of expected price swings in China¡¯s Yuan climbed to an 18-month high and the offshore exchange rate weakened as the central bank doubled the currency¡¯s trading limits versus the dollar.

One-month implied volatility, which is used to price options, rose 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 2.72 percent as of 8:22 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 2.73 percent, the highest since September 2012. The offshore Yuan weakened 0.11 percent to 6.1623 per dollar and reached the lowest intra-day level since May. The People¡¯s Bank of China will announce the daily reference rate at around 9:15 a.m, while the Yuan in Shanghai will start trading at 9:30 a.m.

The onshore Yuan is allowed, from today, to trade as much as 2 percent on either side of the reference rate, the People¡¯s Bank of China said in a March 15 statement. The previous limit was 1 percent. The move came after Premier Li Keqiang and the central bank both named broadening the Yuan band among their 2014 policy goals, which included pledges to give market forces a bigger role in the world¡¯s second-biggest economy.

¡°With the expansion of the trading band, greater uncertainty will be introduced for market participants,¡± Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based currency strategist at Scotiabank, wrote in a note yesterday. ¡°A more volatile exchange rate and higher fixing tendency could indeed incent hot money outflows if onshore policy makers are not careful with how they transmit their renminbi-valuation notions to markets.¡±

Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent to 6.2110 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is a 1 percent discount to the Yuan¡¯s March 14 close in Shanghai. The contracts fell 1.1 percent last week, the biggest weekly drop since November 2011. ¡ª Bloomberg
