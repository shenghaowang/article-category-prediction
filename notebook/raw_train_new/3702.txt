Following both bankruptcy protection filings, first in Japan , and then in the U.S. , troubled Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange is finally allowing users to login on their website to check wallet balances.While the login is now visible on their website, the only thing available for users to do is check their balance. The website also shows a disclaimer stating, ¡°This balance confirmation service is provided on this site only for the convenience of all users. Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users. Rehabilitation claims under a civil rehabilitation procedure become confirmed from a filing which is followed by an investigation procedure. The method for filing claims will be published on this site as soon as we will be in situation to announce it.¡±There have been reports of both theft and fraud surrounding the circumstances in the shutdown of Mt. Gox which has left many investors extremely concerned about balances. While this may be a sigh of relief for some, for others it could be a total shock. It¡¯s better to be prepared for the worst, and hope for the best possible.
