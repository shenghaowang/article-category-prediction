In its first month of sales, recreational marijuana has sold approximately $14 million in the state of Colorado, placing about $2 million worth of tax revenue in the state coffers process.

In the figures released by the State Department of Revenue on Monday, it was shown how much the state has accumulated from recreational and medical marijuana tax fees.

For the month of January, medical marijuana produced approximately $900,000 in additional sales and a total $2.5 million.

¡°The first month of sales for recreational marijuana fell in line with expectations,¡± stated executive director of the department, Barbara Bohl. ¡°We expect clear revenue patterns will emerge by April and plan to incorporate this data into future forecasts.¡±

Governor John Hickenlooper has announced that the state should expect approximately $1 billion in the next fiscal year, with an estimated $134 million expected in taxes and fees. With more than 150 recreational marijuana dispensaries now licensed, revenue is expected to remain steady. While the first $40 million of tax revenue is devoted to school construction, Hickenlooper has suggested the state also launch a heavy campaign addressing the concerns of substance abuse.
