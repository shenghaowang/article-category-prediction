Gold surged in heavy Wednesday trading as investors digested a new and tougher warning issued by the G7 nations to Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. Rising tensions over Russia¡¯s occupation of the Crimea region have boosted the metal¡¯s safe haven appeal.

In a statement, the G7 nations denounced Russia¡¯s ¡°clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.¡± The language signaled a hardening stance by European nations against the planned referendum on Crimea¡¯s secession from Ukraine, currently planned for Sunday. On Wednesday, the European Union reportedly agreed to a framework of possible economic sanctions against Russia that could be imposed if a diplomatic solution is not found soon.
