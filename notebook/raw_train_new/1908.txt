Markets are not enjoying the China data. From the SMH blog:

Shanghai copper has dropped by its 5 per cent daily limit to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country¡¯s first domestic bond default last week.

The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has plunged 5 per cent to 46,670 yuan ($US7600) a tonne, its lowest since September 2009.

On the Comex in New York, copper futures for delivery in May slid as much as 2.8 per cent to $US2.9955 a pound, the lowest intraday level since June 25, and last traded at $US3.0205 in Tokyo. The metal fell 4.2 per cent on Friday, the biggest drop since December 2011, and dropped 3.3 per cent last week.

¡®¡®It¡¯s a bit of panic selling on concern that China¡¯s demand is slowing,¡¯¡¯ said Kazuhiko Saito, a Tokyo-based analyst at commodities broker Fujitomi. ¡®¡®China is driving industrial metals lower.¡¯¡¯
