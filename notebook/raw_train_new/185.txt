Investors might be nervous about worrying data out of China this morning, but research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch argues a Chinese financial crisis is unlikely.

China¡¯s exports unexpectedly fell 18% in February, which led to a plunge in commodity prices Monday and worries that the country¡¯s economy is struggling more than expected. But Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the risk of a financial crisis in China remains slim.

¡°A big concern in the markets in recent months is that defaults in the Chinese bond market could be an early signal of a much bigger financial crisis,¡± he said. ¡°However, in our view, China¡¯s experience is different than past financial crises in several key respects.¡±

Mr. Harris points out bond defaults have been ¡°widely anticipated¡± from struggling companies such as solar-cell maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. and that bonds remain a ¡°modest part of China¡¯s capital markets.¡±

China experienced its first onshore bond market default last week when Shanghai Chaori missed an interest payment on its bonds.

¡°A major crisis would require a string of bad outcomes: first the defaults would have to have big contagion effects and second, government efforts to stem the crisis would have to be ineffective,¡± Mr. Harris said.

The latter part is especially important, because the Chinese government has formidable ammunition to fend off a financial crisis, including the largest foreign reserves in the world.

¡°The Chinese government has both the resources and the will to forcefully intervene if contagion kicks in,¡± he said. ¡°They have a relatively modest budget deficit and huge foreign exchange reserves. Inflation is contained so that will not constrain policy. And we would expect the Chinese authorities to act forcefully, and set aside moral hazard concerns, if a systemic crisis emerges.¡±
