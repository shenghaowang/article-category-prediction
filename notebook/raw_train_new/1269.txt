Retail group Urban Outfitters grew its fourth quarter profit and revenue, but ironically, the growth did not come from the eponymous stores, the company reported Monday afternoon. Rather, sales from Urban brands Anthropologie and Free People helped reverse the losses posted by the 230 Urban Outfitters stores in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Urban Outfitters reported $905 million in fourth quarter fiscal 2014 revenue, a miss over the $910 million the Street was expecting but a 6% increase over the $856 million in revenue reported for the same quarter last year. The company's fourth quarter net income came in at $88.6 million, resulting in earnings of 59 cents per share -- a figure that both beat the analyst consensus of 55 cents per share and marks a three-cent improvement over earnings from the prior-year period.

On a full-year basis, Urban's revenue increased 10% to $3.1 billion, with net income coming in at $282.3 million. Full-year earnings came in at $1.89 per share, up from $1.62 in earnings per share during fiscal 2013.

"I am pleased to announce that Urban produced record earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending January 31, 2014," Richard Hayne, Urban CEO, said in a statement Monday afternoon. "Looking forward, customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at our Anthropologie and Free People brands have been strong, but given the continued challenges facing the Urban Outfitters brand, we remain very cautious about Urban's first quarter performance," he added.

Indeed, despite its name, the Urban Outfitters brand is the weakest of Urban's bunch: it posted $398 in fourth quarter revenue, a 9% decline over the same quarter in 2013. Free People and Anthropologie, meanwhile, saw their sales increase 20% and 10%, respectively. On a full-year basis, Anthropologie and Free People brought in $1.68 billion of Urban's $3.1 billion full-year revenue.

During Urban's fiscal 2014, the company opened 38 new stores including 16 Urban Outfitters stores, 13 Free People stores and 9 Anthropologie stores. It closed one Urban Outfitters location and 2 Anthropologie stores due to lease expirations.

Urban stock waffled in after-hours trading following the release of the earnings report: at first it ticked up 1.2%, then fell 1.4%, then went back into positive territory for a gain of 0.72%. The stock is currently trading at $37.66, for a gain of 0.4%. Year-over-year, the stock is down 9.5%, but if the company is able to turn around its namesake brand, the stock could surge: in January, in fact, a Jefferies analyst gave the retailer a $54 price target, saying that if the Urban and Anthropologie brands can hum along together, the stock should surge.
