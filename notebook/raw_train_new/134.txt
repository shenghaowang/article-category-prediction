This was my first year to grow Kurenai. It has been loaded with large exquisitely colored blooms and continues in the heat. The color here is a little lighter and richer than the photo shows. The intense summer sun and heat here in the southeast have not hampered the blooms, but afternoon shade helps the blooms last longer. The variegated foliage adds more beauty.
