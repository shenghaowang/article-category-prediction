Vodafone has announced that it will purchase Spanish fixed line operator in a deal which is worth 7.2 billion Euros or $10 billion US dollars.

The company recently sold its share of Verizon Wireless in the US, Vodafone raised around $130 billion US dollars from the sale of their Verizon stake.

¡°Demand for unified communications products and services has increased significantly over the last few years in Spain, and this transaction ¡ª together with our fibre-to-the-home build programme ¡ª will accelerate our ability to offer best-in-class propositions in the Spanish market.¡±

Vodafone certainly has plenty of spare cash after the sale of their Verizon Wireless stake, and we can probably expect more deals like this one in the future.
