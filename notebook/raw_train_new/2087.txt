WASHINGTON (AFP) - Chrysler said Wednesday it was recalling almost 868,000 sport-utility vehicles worldwide to fix a brake corrosion problem.

Chrysler said it had launched an investigation after customers complained about stiff brake-pedal action, which was linked to one accident but no injuries.

An estimated 867,795 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs of the model years 2011-2014 will be called in to install shields to protect brake boosters from corrosion caused by water exposure.

"Should water enter the boosters through corroded joints - a previously unseen occurrence - brake function may be compromised if the water freezes," Chrysler said.

The recall affects an estimated 644,354 customers in the United States, 42,380 in Canada, 21,376 in Mexico and 159,685 in other countries, said the unit of Italian group Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.
