Starbucks today announced upcoming enhancements to its mobile app for iPhone.

The upgraded app ¡°will extend the company¡¯s leadership in mobile payment and allow customers to recognize Starbucks employees with a tip,¡± according to the Seattle-based coffee titan.

Beginning March 19, customers using Starbucks App for iPhone in Canada will experience a new design and access to their account and My Starbucks Rewards information. The tip-leaving option will initially only be available for US users.

¡°With more than 11 percent of transactions a week now happening with a mobile device in our stores, and nearly 10 million customers currently using our mobile app, we¡¯re thrilled to make the digital experience even easier and more rewarding for our customers and partners,¡± said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer for Starbucks. ¡°This update to the Starbucks App for iPhone is an important next step in digital innovation at Starbucks and one of the many ways we¡¯ll expand and improve our digital experience in the months to come.¡±

Digital tipping was a top suggestion on MyStarbucksIdea.com. Starbucks expects to introduce a complete update to the Starbucks App for Android, including a digital tipping feature, ¡°later this year.¡±

Another new app feature will be ¡°Shake to Pay¡±: to simplify mobile payments, customers will be able to bring the barcode of their Starbucks Card front and center at any time by shaking their mobile device.
