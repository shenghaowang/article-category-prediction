LONDON: Gold tumbled more than 1 per cent on Friday after stronger-than-expected US jobs data helped soothe fears of an abrupt slowdown in the world's biggest economy.

Spot gold fell as much as 1.5pc to a session low of $1,329.35 an ounce, and was trading down 1.2pc at $1,335.20 by 1527 GMT.

The metal, seen as a safe haven, was still on track for a fifth straight week of gains, capitalising on gains made earlier in the week when tensions in Ukraine escalated.

Physical demand for gold has been subdued since prices crossed $1,300.¡ªReuters
