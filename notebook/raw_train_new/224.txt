Most economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal think the Federal Reserve won¡¯t raise interest rates before June 2015 despite a falling unemployment rate and improving economy.

The Fed has said it will keep short-term interest rates near zero, where they have been anchored since December 2008, ¡°well past the time¡± the jobless rate falls below 6.5%. It ticked up to 6.7% in February, according to the Labor Department, but economists in the survey estimated it will hit the 6.5% threshold this June.
