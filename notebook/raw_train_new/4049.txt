The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced a 2014 Toyota Highlander recall for models manufactured between November 20, 2013 and January 18, 2014. The 7,067 units involved may have an improperly installed third row middle seat belt that could result in a greater risk of injury during the crash.

According to the NHTSA¡¯s 2014 Toyota Highlander recall notice, the affected models¡¯ third row middle seat belt assembly may not have been properly secured to the vehicle floor anchorage during vehicle assembly. This would mean that the third row middle seat belts do not adhere to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 210, ¡°Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages.¡± In laymen¡¯s terms, a seat belt that is not properly secured to its anchorage is ill-equipped to protect in the event of a crash, and the Highlanders in question may put occupants at greater risk for injury should an accident occur.

To remedy the situation, Toyota will notify owners of the affected Highlanders, and dealers will subsequently offer free inspections of the third row middle seat belt anchor. Should the equipment be found to be faulty, repairs will be made free of charge.

2014 Highlander owners may contact Toyota at 1-800-331-4331; owners may also contact the NHTSA through their Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or by visiting www.safercar.gov.
