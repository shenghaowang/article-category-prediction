Federal authorities are spreading the word about what they are calling the largest nationwide phone scam ever. Officials say more than $1 million has been stolen from thousands of unsuspecting people. The calls involve an IRS impostor who will tell you you owe taxes that must be paid with a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. Authorities say the scammers threaten arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license for those who do not pay up.
