New numbers released Monday show that the state's unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. That's the lowest the rate has been since June 2008.

There are an estimated 581,000 Floridians out of work.

Florida's unemployment rate remains below the national average of 6.6 percent.

Gov. Rick Scott has contended the state's unemployment rate is dropping due to his policies.

But state economists have said a big reason for the decline is that people are leaving the labor force or had delayed their job search.

Florida has added close to 200,000 jobs in the last year. That's the third highest amount in the nation according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
