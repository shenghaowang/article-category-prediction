US stocks have slipped as weak economic data from China and Japan pushes most equity international markets lower.

At the closing bell on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.43 (0.20 per cent) to 16,419.29.

The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.86 (0.05 per cent) to 1,877.18, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 1.77 (0.04 per cent) to 4,334.44.

Earlier, Asian and European markets lost ground after China reported weak inflation data and a $US23.0 billion ($A25.52 billion) trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $US11.9 billion surplus.

"Markets are retreating on the weak Chinese exports data, which is consistent with our view that the China economy is slowing," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.

Meanwhile, Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 per cent, than the previously reported 0.3 per cent.
