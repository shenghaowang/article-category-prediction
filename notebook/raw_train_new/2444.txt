Russia's nationalized Gazprom is accusing Ukraine of faltering on payments for previously delivered natural gas, increasing the threat of a supply disruption to the troubled country and the European Union. Events this week sparked plenty of commentary on the United States using its vast natural gas resources as a diplomatic weapon to soften Russia's hand.

While the United States is currently sitting on an ocean of inexpensive natural gas, exporting the fuel will not weaken Russia's resource control over Europe for three reasons. First, the U.S. government could cut all the red tape in exporting LNG, but commercial interests are not going to ship to Europe when much healthier margins are made by exporting to Asia. Even if prices skyrocketed in Europe, LNG regasification and natural gas storage is severely inadequacy. Finally, Russian natural gas is produced from conventional wells, making it the cost leader, effectively giving Russia command over market share and holding the winning hand.
