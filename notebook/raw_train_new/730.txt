The Bank of England has unveiled three new high-ranking appointments as governor Mark Carney beefs up his leadership team in the face of damaging claims relating to the global foreign exchange rate-rigging investigation.

International Monetary Fund deputy managing director Nemat Shafik will take on the newly-created role of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking.

Dr "Minouche" Shafik, who will be the first female deputy governor since Rachel Lomax left in 2008, will join on August 1 with a priority to conduct a root and branch review of how the Bank monitors markets following allegations that some of its officials knew about alleged forex fixing. Ben Broadbent - one of the Bank's nine-strong rate-setting team - was also named as successor to Charlie Bean, the outgoing deputy governor for monetary policy, while Anthony Habgood will become the new chairman of the court of the Bank of England as part of the raft of appointments, which were confirmed by the Treasury today. Mr Habgood, who is chairman of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread, will take over from Sir David Lees on July 1 as the supervisory body comes under criticism for its governance oversight in the wake of the forex claims.
