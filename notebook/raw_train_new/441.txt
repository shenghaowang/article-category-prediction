Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pledged to go "above and beyond" the standards expected of the financial-services industry as it seeks to maintain the central bank's integrity in light of its links to a sprawling investigation into possible currency-market manipulation.

The governor was called to testify to the UK's Treasury Select Committee after the UK central bank suspended one of its employees in relation to the probe into currency-trading practices last week.
