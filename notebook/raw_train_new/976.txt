PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - Numericable Chief Executive Eric Denoyer said there was no need to sell assets in order to address competition issues as part of its bid to buy Vivendi¡¯s SFR and criticised a rival offer from Bouygues Telecom as not credible.

¡°Our strategy is to build the best network and use it to grow - not on marrying two operators in decline just to wring out cost savings,¡± Denoyer said. ¡°There is no need for asset sale or concessions or anything.¡±

He added: ¡°Our synergies can be put in place very quickly because they are network based. The synergies can come through as early as this year.¡±

Bouygues Telecom said on the weekend it had agreed to sell its mobile network and much of its spectrum to smaller rival Iliad as a way to head off competition regulators¡¯ concerns about its pending bid for SFR.

¡°I don¡¯t even need to explain my plan B because I don¡¯t think the other project is credible,¡± Denoyer added, referring to the rival offer. (Reporting by Leila Abboud; Editing by Andrew Callus)
