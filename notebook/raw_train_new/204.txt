Tripoli - Libya's parliament has passed a no-confidence vote in the newly-elected prime minister, removing him from his post.

Mustafa Abushagur had until Sunday to form a Cabinet or risk losing his job.

His initial list of ministers was criticised for not being diverse enough.

Abushagur was Libya's first elected prime minister after last year's overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

The General National Congress voted 125 versus 44 in favour of removing him as prime minister.
