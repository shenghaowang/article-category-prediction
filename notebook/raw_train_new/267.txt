American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO ) posted adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share for the 13 week period ended February 1, 2014, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share for the 14 week period ended February 2, 2013.

Jay Schottenstein, Interim CEO stated, "The Company's results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations. We're taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers. Our brands remain incredibly strong and I'm confident in our ability to execute the strategic plan and resume long-term profitable growth."

The company said that business conditions remain challenging, with severe winter weather contributing to weak demand. Based on a high single-digit decline in comparable sales, management expects first quarter EPS to be approximately breakeven compared to adjusted EPS of $0.18 last year. The guidance excludes potential asset impairment and restructuring charges.

Shares of AEO are lower by 5.75% in early trading.
