Households across the country were today invited to ¡°celebrate¡± when the Bank of England finally hikes interest rates after five years at 0.5 per cent.

Outgoing deputy governor Charlie Bean told a business audience that there were ¡°clear signs¡± the economy was on the mend and that the Monetary Policy Committee was ¡°doing its utmost to ensure that the recovery is not nipped in the bud¡±.

He added: ¡°When the time does come for us to start raising the Bank Rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.¡±

Bean hailed signs of a recovery in business investment but added that the UK¡¯s export recovery had been ¡°somewhat disappointing¡± and flagged up a 10 per cent rise in the value of the pound over the past year as contributing to that. ¡°Any further appreciation of sterling ¡­ would not be particularly helpful,¡± he added.

While a rate rise will be good news for savers, rising mortgage payments will hit millions of homeowners on floating-rate deals when rates finally go up.

Financial markets believe borrowing costs will begin to rise in the spring of next year although Bean urged against ¡°getting too hung up on the precise date¡± of the first rate hike.

The deputy Governor said the past five years had been ¡°tough for both businesses and households¡±, but they would have been tougher still without the MPC¡¯s emergency liquidity action.
