The system's factory settings restrict the flow of brake fluid too much, causing customers to complain about an odd feeling in the brake pedal, according to Chrysler. 



"Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations," the company said in a statement. Another 6,555 SUVs outside the U.S. have also been recalled. 



Also on Chrysler Group's recall list are 18,100 Fiat 500L cars in the U.S. from the 2014 model year.
