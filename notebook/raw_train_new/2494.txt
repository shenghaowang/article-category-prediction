Jos. A. Bank is staging its biggest sale ever ¡ª and it¡¯s a 2-for-1 deal.

The men¡¯s suit retailer, which has sparred with Men¡¯s Wearhouse for the past six months in a bitter merger battle, agreed Tuesday to be purchased by its archrival for $1.8 billion.

The deal will create the nation¡¯s fourth-largest men¡¯s apparel retailer, with a combined $3.5 billion in sales and 23,000 employees operating 1,700 stores nationwide.

¡°All of us at Men¡¯s Wearhouse have great respect for the Jos. A. Bank management team and are eager to work with Jos. A. Bank¡¯s talented employees,¡± Men¡¯s Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert said in a statement.

That¡¯s in stark contrast to a torrent of public scorn Men¡¯s Wearhouse has heaped on Jos. A. Bank Chairman Bob Wildrick, accusing him of trying strenuously to block a deal to save his own job.

In months of bickering, Jos. A. Bank countered that Men¡¯s Wearhouse had pooh-poohed the whole idea of a merger last fall, citing antitrust concerns as it deflected Jos. A. Bank¡¯s advances.

The companies said Tuesday they are working with federal regulators, who are reviewing the deal.

The merger, which values Jos. A. Bank at $65 a share, is up from a $55-a-share offer Men¡¯s Wearhouse made in January, countering an offer made last fall by Jos. A. Bank for $2.3 billion, or $48 a share.

Shares of Jos. A. Bank rose 3.9 percent Tuesday to close at $64.22. Men¡¯s Wearhouse shares rose 4.7 percent to close at $57.12.

As part of the deal, Jos. A. Bank said it will scrap an agreement to acquire Eddie Bauer.

While that deal was widely seen as a bargaining tool, its demise is a windfall for Eddie Bauer owner Golden Gate Capital, which will walk away with a $48 million breakup fee.
