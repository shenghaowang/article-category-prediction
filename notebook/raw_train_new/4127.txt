Applications for mortgages in the U.S. fell 2.1% in the latest week on rising interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This drop comes after the strong uptick in applications at the end of February.The MBA¡¯s seasonally adjusted index of mortgage activity fell 2.1% to 373.3 in the week ending on March 7. At the end of last year, the index reached its lowest level since December 2000 shortly after the Federal Reserve announced it would begin reducing its monthly bond purchasing program as the economy improves.

The seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications dropped 3.1% week-over-week, with refinancing activity making up 57% of all mortgage activity, down from 57.7%. This is 6% lower than the refinancing share at the start of 2014 and the lowest share since April 2011. Requests for home purchase loans fell 0.5%. The unadjusted purchase index was 17% lower than a year earlier.

During the week, contract and effective rates rose for all mortgage products, with the average rate for a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4.52% with 0.29 points, compared to 4.47% with 0.28 points a week before.

The average rate for a jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loan was 4.41%, which represents an increase of 4 basis points from the previous week. FHA loans carried an average rate of 4.18% (up from 4.13%), while 15-year fixed loans increased to an average 3.53% (up from 3.52%).

Adjustable rate mortgages represented 8% of all mortgage applications, which has remained unchanged for more than a month.

The MBA survey covers 75% of retail residential mortgage applications in the country and has been conducted weekly since 1990.

This new data comes just a day after a housing survey found home price gains slowed in December. The Standard & Poor¡¯s/Case-Shiller home price index for 20 major cities rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in December, compared to 0.9% the month before. Prices rose 13.7% in 2013 and reached their peak in November.

Recent housing data released over the past two months shows that activity at the start of 2014 is slowing and the housing recovery is losing momentum.

Housing starts dropped 16% in January, which is the largest drop in more than 3 years, while home resales dropped to an 18-month low in February. Extreme winter weather across the United States has been blamed at least in part for much of this weakness, although analysts believe rising mortgage rates and low inventory is doing its part as well.
