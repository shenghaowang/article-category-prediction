MtGox boss Mark Karpeles has been targeted by hackers following the company's recent bankruptcy protection filing.

The Bitcoin magnate's personal blog and Reddit account were breached, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.

The leaked material includes an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million transactions, entries from the firm's business ledger and details about its admin software.

"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," said the hackers in a statement accompanying the data dump.

MtGox went dark last month after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around 210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole.

It remains unclear whether the information leaked by hackers was genuine and sheds any light on the incident, according to Forbes.
