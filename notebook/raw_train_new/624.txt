GOLD futures have edged higher, as a simmering geopolitical conflict in Ukraine and weaker US equities bolstered investor interest in haven assets.

Gold for April delivery, the most active contract, on Monday rose $US3.30, or 0.3 per cent, to settle at $US1,341.50 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Gold has marched higher in recent weeks, as investors stocked up on the store-of-value asset amid worries about the US economy and an escalating crisis in Eastern Europe. Some traders view gold as a hedge against political and economic uncertainty, because it tends to keep its value during periods of instability.

On Friday, a better-than-expected US jobs report interrupted gold's run higher. The data showed that businesses stepped up hiring in February, offsetting worries about the US labour market.

But gold prices turned higher on Monday, as investors shifted focus back to Ukraine amid reports that Russian troops and locals continued to besiege Ukrainian military bases in Crimea, halting delivery of food and supplies to some of them. Russian troops have been occupying Ukraine's Crimea region in a move that's sparked threats of economic and diplomatic sanctions from the US and its European allies.

"There's still enough people who want to hold gold as insurance," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading LLC.

A weaker tone to US equity markets also gave gold a boost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 16418.68.
