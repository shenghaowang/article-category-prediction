WASHINGTON ¨C The Pentagon says a team of Navy SEALs has taken control of a stateless oil tanker seized earlier in the month by Libyan rebels.

The SEALs boarded the tanker Morning Glory late Sunday in international waters southeast of Cyprus. Rear Adm. John Kirby says no one was injured in the operation, which was approved by President Barack Obama.

The vessel, whose ownership remains a mystery, was carrying stolen Libyan crude oil from the port of Al-Sidra. Libyan officials had ordered the tanker confiscated, but it managed to escape.

The Pentagon says the Morning Glory will return to Libya under the control of sailors from the USS Stout.

The Morning Glory previously sailed under a North Korean flag, but North Korea says it has nothing to do with the ship.
