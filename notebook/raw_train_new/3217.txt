China¡¯s move to double the daily range within which its currency can move may be good for the country¡¯s long-term economic development.

But the prospect of wider swings amid a slowing economy could prompt exporters to stash more cash offshore, accelerating a slowdown in credit growth in China and further squeezing strapped borrowers.

After nudging the value of the renminbi down by more than 1.6% against the U.S. dollar since January to its lowest level in 15 years, the People¡¯s Bank of China said over the weekend that the currency would be able to trade as much as 2% higher or lower than the daily rate it sets.

Currencies rarely move so much in a single day, particularly not China¡¯s tightly controlled yuan. But unlikely doesn¡¯t mean impossible ¡ª so one can reasonably expect Chinese companies and the banks that service them to start hedging against the risk of higher volatility in the currency¡¯s rate.
