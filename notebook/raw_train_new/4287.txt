The U.S. has taken control of a tanker full of oil loaded from a rebel-held port in Libya, the Pentagon says. The raid by Navy Seals took place in international waters south of Cyprus, said Rear Adm John Kirby. The Morning Glory's evasion of a naval blockade at the eastern port of Sidra prompted Libya's parliament to sack Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last week.
