The founder of one of the most successful hedge-fund firms in the world, Steven A. Cohen, will remove his initials from the company¡¯s front door as the firm continues to distance itself from legal turmoil related to insider trading.

SAC Capital Advisors LP, launched by Mr. Cohen in 1992, will drop the monogram of its founder in its name starting next month, according to a memo sent to employees reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
