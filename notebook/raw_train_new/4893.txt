A new Iowa Workforce Development report shows unemployment increased slightly in January over December.

The rate was 4.3 percent in January compared to 4.2 percent in December.



The rate was 5.0 percent last January. The national unemployment rate in January was 6.6 percent -- the lowest national rate since October 2008.

"Despite a slight increase in the January unemployment rate, Iowa's unemployment conditions have improved substantially from one year ago," said Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development in a news release issued Monday. "The state's annual average unemployment rate for 2013 dropped to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2012. Iowa had the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the nation in 2013."

Iowa nonfarm employment decreased by 7,300 jobs in January, lowering the total to 1,536,900. The monthly drop was dominated by larger-than-expected service sector layoffs in trade and transportation, as seasonal workers were laid off. In the goods-producing sector, construction also contributed to the loss.



Government was down 800 jobs in local and federal government, outweighing the gains in state government. Nonfarm employment has steadily trended upward despite the recent weakness, and is currently 19,500 jobs higher than one year ago (+1.3 percent).

Professional and business services added the most jobs in January (+1,600), partly due to early seasonal hiring in accounting and tax specialty firms. This monthly gain more than offset the slight loss in temporary help services. Financial activities added 900 jobs to offset smaller losses over the last few months. This sector has been resilient in Iowa, and is 900 jobs higher than a year ago and also at an all-time high.



Alternatively, retail trade accounted for over half of the jobs lost this month (-4,500), which was largely due to retail stores reducing their staff to pre-holiday levels. Transportation and warehousing industries also dropped employment (900), reflecting the seasonal layoffs of package delivery couriers. The construction sector pared jobs for the second month in a row (-2,600). However, the outlook for this sector is bright with the demand for new residential housing and commercial buildings on the rise.

Compared to last January, nonfarm employment has added 19,500 jobs. As a result of the annual benchmark revision, manufacturing is once again leading all sectors in year-over-year gains (+4,100). Education and health services followed closely behind (+4,000), and professional and business services ranked in third place (+3,900). Information services has been on a downward trend for the past decade, and trails last year¡¯s level by 800 jobs. Construction is down a slight 400 jobs from one year ago.
