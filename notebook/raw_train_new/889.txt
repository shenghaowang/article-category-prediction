McDonald's comparable sales in the United States were decreased 1.4 percent. The company noted the ¡°challenging industry dynamics¡± and severe weather in February.

Europe's comparable sales were up 0.6 percent, but were unable to hedge the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) segment which was down 2.6 percent.

Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth.¡±
