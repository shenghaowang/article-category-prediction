New York's attorney-general has begun investigating split-second stock trading by high-frequency traders and is asking the exchanges to end them.

Calling them "unfair" at the expense of other investors, Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman says federal and other state regulators should join in structural reforms.

While Schneiderman discussed his concerns at a symposium on Tuesday at New York University, his office began investigating such trades last year.

He says millisecond timing advantages let those traders make "rapid and often risk-free trades before the rest of the market can catch up".

New York's attorney-general has authority to investigate and prosecute securities fraud under the Martin Act, which it has used to force Wall Street reforms.
