Officers were called to the home in the 300 block of N. 21st Street near Griffiths Avenue around 8:15 p.m. on March 6.

That's where an LMPD spokesperson says the body of 44-year-old James Newton was found inside a home. Police believe he lived in the area.

"It is being treated as a homicide," said LMPD spokeswoman Alicia Smiley on Thursday.

On Saturday night, police arrested 28-year-old Joseph M. Carter and charged him with murder. Police say they also arrested 28-year-old Sammy Gibson, Jr. Monday afternoon. Police say that on Thursday night, Carter and Gibson got into an argument with Newton and killed him. Police say that at some point after the murder, evidence was removed from the scene and/or destroyed, and that police found property taken from Newton after he was killed.

Both men are charged with murder, tampering with evidence and robbery.
