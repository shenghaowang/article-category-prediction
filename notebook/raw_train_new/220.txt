Li says when he was in Hanoi during a tour to the ASEAN countries in 2013, he reached consensus with Vietnamese leaders on a variety of issues including maritime joint development. 



He said he wanted to hear what the people there say about China and Vietnam working together, so he left his hotel and visited a small shop in the evening, where the female shop owner recognized him right away.



"She welcomes Chinese customers; certainly they would bring more business to her shop. I asked her about her opinion on relations between neighboring countries, and she wished for people to live in peace and friendship, which I think is also everyone's wish," Li said. 



Li has stressed mutual respect for neighboring countries to work in harmony and pursue common interest.



The premier added that people need to work together to maximize mutual benefits and minimize conflict, which would benefit everybody.
