NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Markets slid Monday amid poor economic data from China and Japan, while tensions continued in Ukraine.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.21% to 16,418.68, while the S&P 500 was off 0.05% to 1,877.17. The Nasdaq dropped 0.4% to 4,334.45.
 Japan's economy expanded by an annualized 0.7% from the prior quarter, down from the previous preliminary estimate of 1%. In another discouraging sign for the export-driven economy and "Abenomics," its current account deficit widened to a record 1.589 trillion yen ($15.38 billion) in January. China reported a trade deficit of $23 billion for February, a big miss from expectations for a trade surplus of $14.5 billion. Exports from China fell 18.1% in February from a year earlier, customs data from March 8 showed. This was the largest fall since August 2009.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced support on Sunday for the Crimea to become part of Russia. Russia has threatened to cut off gas to Ukraine, claiming it owes $1.89 billion for supplies. A similar shutdown in 2009 for several weeks hiked prices and caused shortages in other parts of Europe. The Ukraine relies on Russia for 70% of its gas supply.
