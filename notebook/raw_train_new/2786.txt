The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has imposed an import alert, effectively a ban, on generic drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries plant in Gujarat.



An "import alert" results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices, according to the FDA website.



A spokesman for Sun, India's biggest drugmaker by market value, was not available for comment.
