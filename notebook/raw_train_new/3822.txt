Washington: US Navy SEALs boarded and took control of an oil tanker late on Sunday that was seized earlier this month at a Libyan port by three armed men, the US Department of Defense said.

No one was hurt in the boarding operation, approved by US President Barack Obama, requested by the Libyan and Cypriot governments and conducted in international waters southeast of Cyprus, said Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby.

"The Morning Glory is carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra," the statement said while adding that the Morning Glory will be underway soon to a port in Libya with a team of sailors from the USS Stout (DDG-55) embarked.
