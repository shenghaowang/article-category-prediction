MUMBAI, March 13 (Reuters) - The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has imposed an import alert, effectively a ban, on Indian generic drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd¡¯s plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat.

An ¡°import alert¡± results in the detention without physical examination of drugs from firms that have not met so-called good manufacturing practices, according to the FDA website.

A spokesman for Sun, India¡¯s biggest drugmaker by market value, was not available for comment.

The plant in Karkhadi in Gujarat makes both drug ingredients and formulations, according to Sun¡¯s 2013 annual report.
