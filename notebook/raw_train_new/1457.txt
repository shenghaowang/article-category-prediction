Gold rose to fresh six-month high on Friday and was headed for its biggest weekly gain in four weeks, buoyed by mounting tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, and worries over an economic slowdown in China.

The metal has gained over 2 percent this week, marking its sixth straight weekly rise, as investors exited riskier assets such as equities.

While money flowing into gold-backed exchange-traded funds has increased, reflecting confidence in the metal`s outlook, physical demand has quietened as higher prices put off buyers ¨C making some cautious about how long the rally can last.

¡°While gold`s push higher is attracting greater investment demand, higher prices may be cooling emerging market physical appetite,¡± HSBC analysts said in a note.
