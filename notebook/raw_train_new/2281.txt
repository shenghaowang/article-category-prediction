KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA ¨C It¡¯s been five days since Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared into thin air, and the mystery is deepening every day.

Officials are expanding their search yet again, with 12 countries now scouring 27,000 square miles of land and water in southeast Asia.

Now it seems the expansive search may be paying off ¡ª a Chinese satellite looking into the disappearance ¡°has observed a suspected crash area at sea,¡± a Chinese agency said.

While those possible findings develop, Colorado-based company DigitalGlobe is enlisting the public`s help by pointing satellites at the search area and posting the images online.

Additionally, an oil rig worker claims he may have seen the plane go down off the coast of Vietnam.

He said in a letter to his employer that he saw something ¡°burning at high altitude¡± around the time the plane disappeared.

Vietnamese authorities sent an aircraft to investigate, but no word on any findings yet.

Meanwhile, family members desperate for news of their loved ones are growing increasingly upset.

¡°My son, you need to find him, you need to search quicker,¡± one distraught father shouted at authorities.

Officials say they are doing all they can, but that is small comfort to family members desperately trying to cling to hope.
