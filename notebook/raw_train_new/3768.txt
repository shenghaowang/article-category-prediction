Chrysler is recalling 2012-'13 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs in order to fix a concern with the antilock brakes.

Approximately 25,250 vehicles are affected by the recall.

The recall will help improve pedal feel during "certain aggressive braking maneuvers," Chrysler said in a statement on its website.

"A supplier raised with the company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop," Chrysler said in a statement.

Chrysler said it does not know of any related injuries or accidents.

Of the affected vehicles, approximately 18,700 are in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico and 5,200 outside the NAFTA region, according to the automaker.

A specific recall date has not been announced yet.

"Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations," said Chrysler. "An investigation discovered brake-fluid flow was being restricted too much. A software update optimizes flow and restores appropriate pedal feel."

Chrysler dealers are being instructed to update the software in the affected vehicles, free of charge.
