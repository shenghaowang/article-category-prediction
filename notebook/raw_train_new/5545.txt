New York is taking a closer look at high-frequency traders¡ªand how stock exchanges are helping them, for a price.

Eric Schneiderman, the state¡¯s attorney general, said he has opened an investigation into the sale of products and services that offer high-frequency traders faster access to data. Schneiderman has made the combating of what he calls ¡°Insider Trading 2.0¡± a central focus.

Stock markets charge traders thousands of dollars to ¡°co-locate¡± their servers at the exchanges¡¯ data centers, giving them access to data milliseconds before those whose servers are elsewhere. Schneiderman is also looking at dark pools and at high-frequency traders themselves.

¡°This new breed of predatory behavior gives a small segment of the industry an enormous advantage over all other competitors and allows them to use new technologies to reap huge profits based on very, very minor, but nonetheless unfair, advantages,¡± Schneiderman said yesterday. ¡°Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency traders, our markets, as structured today, are increasingly too focused on catering to them.¡±

The attorney general said he would push for new rules to curtail those advantages.

¡°My office is going to continue to shine a light on unseemly practices,¡± Schneiderman said. ¡°I look forward to joining with other regulators and my colleagues in government in taking real, concrete steps to deal with this problem.¡±
