WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After ending the previous session sharply lower, stocks are likely to see some further downside in early trading on Friday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 43 points.

The downward momentum comes amid a global sell-off, with stock markets in Asia and Europe falling sharply following yesterday's substantial weakness on Wall Street.

While European growth concerns are being cited for the weakness, Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, suggested that it may actually reflect a loss of confidence in European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's ability to offset the economic slowdown.

"European growth concerns have been an issue for years but what has not been an issue until now is a lack of faith in Draghi to offset it," Boockvar said. "'Out of bullets' is a well used clich¨¦ but it is gaining traction with respect to all central banks."

He added, "Combine this with the end of Federal Reserve QE and market turbulence is what you get after a massive run over the past few years."

On the US economic front, the Labor Department recently released a report showing that another sharp drop in fuel prices contributed to a continued decline in US import prices in the month of September.
