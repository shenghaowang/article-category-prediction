The Federal Trade Commission has launched a civil investigation into Herbalife Ltd., the Los Angeles-based nutritional-products maker said Wednesday.

Herbalife did not disclose any details of the probe, but it has been waging an ongoing battle against a hedge fund manager¡¯s allegations that it is running a thinly disguised pyramid scheme.

The company reiterated its long-stated position that its business model is sound and said it would cooperate with the inquiry.

"Herbalife welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC,¡± the company said in a statement. ¡°We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.¡±

Herbalife¡¯s shares sank after the company disclosed that the federal agency had sent it a civil investigative demand. The stock fell $6.89, or 10.5%, to $58.50 immediately after the news.
