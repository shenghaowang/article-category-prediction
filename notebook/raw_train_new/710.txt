Wall Street eased modestly, as investors had their first chance to react to soft data out of China over the weekend.

The Dow Jones lost 0.2 per cent to close at 16,419.

The S&P 500 was also down, but a mere 1 point to 1,877, while the Nasdaq was off 2 points to 4,334.

An unexpectedly sharp 18 per cent pull-back in China's exports fuelled concern on Wall Street that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.

The data set off an sharp 8.3 per cent slide in the iron ore price, its biggest one-day price fall in more than four years.

Iron ore was worth $US104.70 at Tianjin in China, which is its lowest price since October 2012, and Chinese steel futures dropped to record lows.

John Noonan, Head of IFR Forexwatch Asia for Thomson Reuters, says China's latest import and export data is largely to blame.

"The main factor is expectations that last month's slump in iron ore imports by China will continue due to the weakening yuan and huge stockpiles at China ports," he said.

Back in the US, and shares in Boeing, manufacturer of the Malaysia Airline's plane that is missing presumed crashed, dropped 2 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.

The sharp fall in metal prices weighed on mining stocks on London's FTSE 100, which is heavy on resources stocks, and it closed down 0.4 per cent to 6,689.

Shares in Rio Tinto lost 1.9 per cent, after having fallen much more steeply yesterday in Australia.

The Australian share market was set for a flat start to trade - the ASX SPI 200 was up 1 point at 5,421.

The Australian dollar was buying 90.19 US cents.

On commodity markets, the spot gold price was slightly lower at $US1,339.91 an ounce.

Oil continues to see steady trade, with West Texas crude barely changed from Friday at $US101.34 a barrel, and Singapore's Tapis crude priced at $US114.56.
