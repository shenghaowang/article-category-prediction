Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said there may be more slack in the economy than the bank estimated in February.

In testimony to the Treasury Committee, he said the Monetary Policy Committee ranged in the February Inflation Report that spare capacity was 1-1.5 percent.

"I personally would be at the upper end of that range and I would add that the margin, given the most recent employment report that we are probably slightly higher than that 1.5 percent," Carney told lawmakers.

However, policymaker Martin Weale said the slack in the economy is overstated.

Any unwinding of quantitative easing should occur after several adjustments in interest rates, Carney said. He said it is not unreasonable to raise rate to 2 percent to 2.5 percent over the next three years.
