¡°A supplier raised with the Company a concern about the performance of a component that accommodates Ready Alert Braking, a Chrysler Group safety system that primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop. Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation, but pedal feel was not consistent with customer expectations,¡± the Detroit-based automaker explained.An investigation revealed that brake-fluid flow was being restricted too much and that a software update is required to optimize flow and restore appropriate pedal feel.Chrysler has yet to announce a timetable for the recall, but said customers will be notified when to schedule service. All repairs will supported by the manufacturer.About 18,700 of the affected SUVs were sold in the United States, while 825 were delivered in Canada and 530 in Mexico. The remaining 5,200 examples were sold outside North America.Concerned customers are advised to contact the Chrysler Group at 1-800-853-1403.In related news, Chrysler is also recalling the brand new 2014 Ram ProMaster full-size van this month. Nearly 10,000 units need to be checked over stuck accelerator pedal concerns, while another 6,800 examples are being brought back for potentially damaged brake hoses. Half of these vehicles are still in dealer hands, Chrysler said last month.
