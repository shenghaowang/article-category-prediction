TOKYO¡ªToyota Motor Corp. has shut down its Indian auto plants amid a prolonged wage dispute, further clouding the outlook for one of the auto maker's most important future growth markets.

The Japanese car maker decided to suspend operations at its two auto assembly plants near Bangalore on Sunday due to "deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors" by some union members, Toyota's Indian unit Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Ltd. said in a statement.
