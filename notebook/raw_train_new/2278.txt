The maker of the hugely popular puzzle game Candy Crush is hoping to raise up to $532.8 million in its initial public offering as it values its operations at nearly $7.6 billion, reflecting the rapid ascendence of the online mobile gaming industry.

The developer of the irresistibly addictive game, King Digital Entertainment, wants to sell 22.2 million shares between $21 and $24 in its IPO, placing it ahead of its rival and last game giant to go public, Zynga. Candy Crush¡¯s maker King initially filed for the IPO last month.

The company saw an average of 144 million daily active users playing its games more than 1.4 billion times a day¡ªan increase from 128 million daily active users playing more than 1.2 billion times in December.

King¡¯s target valuation for its IPO would set it behind more established gaming players like Electronic Arts ($9.2 billion valuation) and Activision Blizzard ($14.3 billion).
