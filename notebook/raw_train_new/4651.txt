Walmart Will Accept Video Game Trade-Ins Starting on March 26th in the US

Not wanting to let other retailers like GameStop, Best Buy, and Amazon have all the fun, Walmart has decided to enter the $2 billion pre-owned video game business.

Walmart will allow for trade-ins to Walmart employees starting today, with official trade-ins to customers beginning on March 26th at over 3,100 stores. Then, in the Summer, Walmart will be reselling the used games in stores and online, calling them ¡°Certified Pre-Owned¡±.

Walmart made sure to note that ¡°new releases will still remain the focus of our business,¡± but when it comes to trading in games for a Walmart gift card (which can be used to buy anything in stores and online), their strategy is ¡°to pay more for used games, sell new and used games for less, and give our customers the flexibility to spend their money how they want.¡± They also added, ¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins.¡±
