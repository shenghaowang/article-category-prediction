General Motors will offer $500 rebates to owners of the 1.37 million cars that it has recalled over a faulty ignition switch, according to the Detroit Free Press. The rebate will be good through April 30th and can be used towards the purchase of any 2013, 2014 or 2015 Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, or GMC vehicle.

¡°In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle,¡± said GM spokesman Alan Adler. ¡°We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance.¡±

Dealers were notified of the rebate in a March 5th memo from GM, which also provided guidance on how to answer questions and concerns about the recall. The letter has since been posted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration¡¯s website.

GM is not suggesting owners of the affected cars buy a new vehicle to remedy the problem, the Free Press reports. Instead, the rebates are being offered as validation to GM¡¯s commitment to customer service.

¡°This special cash allowance must be passed on to the eligible customer at the time of the transaction and is in addition to other national and regional offers,¡± the letter reads. ¡°And is intended to assist those customers who are unhappy and may want to trade out of their vehicle or buy a new GM product.¡±

The letter also informed owners that parts for the ignition repairs will be available in April, and included instructions on how to request reimbursement for ignition switch repairs they have paid for in the past. If the ignition switch has been replaced in the past, it still needs to be replaced again as part of this recall.

In addition, GM is offering courtesy vehicles to those owners afraid to drive their vehicles, and will cover the towing costs for affected vehicles as well as the fees for rental vehicles.
