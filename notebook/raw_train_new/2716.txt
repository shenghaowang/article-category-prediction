Starbucks (SBUX) is rolling out mobile ordering this year as a test to reduce service time and promote its mobile app.

The move will allow customers to order coffee and other Starbucks product before walking in the store or while waiting in line. Chief digital officer Adam Brotman said that the company is actively working on making mobile ordering a reality.

¡°It¡¯s something our customers have asked for,¡± he said. ¡°We¡¯re not revealing a lot of details about it now.¡±

Starbucks processes about 5 million mobile transactions a week. The company¡¯s working on expanding and improving its rewards program to boost sales.

SBUX stock is up about 0.8% Wednesday.
