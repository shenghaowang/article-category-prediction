Metro-North serves 281,000 riders a day in New York and Connecticut. It has experienced a spate of problems in the last year, including a derailment in the Bronx that killed four passengers.

In May 2013, a Metro-North employee, Robert Luden, 52, of East Haven, was struck by a train and killed while working on a track in West Haven. Officials said the train should not have been on the track. Luden¡¯s family has sued Metro-North, claiming the company was careless and negligent. The family is seeking $30 million.

The problems have led to scrutiny from lawmakers, both at the federal level and locally, and commuter groups.
