In a turbulent sea of global stock markets worried about the weak Chinese trade data, Australia¡¯s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 is managing to keep its head above water ¡ª currently trading 0.1% higher ¡ª buoyed by some strength in the banks and insurers.

Of the Big Four lenders, ANZ and NAB are flat, but CBA and Westpac are both up 0.2%. Meanwhile, Macquarie is 0.2% higher, and Suncorp is up 0.9%, while QBE Insurance and IAG are up 0.5% apiece.

But miners are down, and in some cases down a lot. This, as copper languishes at eight-month lows and, more importantly, spot iron ore saw its biggest drop in four years as investors worried about Chinese demand.

As Rivkin CEO Scott Schuberg puts it in his daily premarket note: ¡°Unlike copper, this market [iron ore] has broken down through recent lows, and we can only sit back and watch as the iron-ore price finds its new home.¡±

And so, it¡¯s a 2.2% loss for Fortescue Metals and a 2.7% fall for Atlas Iron, though both are off their opening lows. (Atlas was off more than 5% at one point.)

Among other mining-sector casualties, Whitehaven Coal is down 3.1%, and in the gold space, Evolution is down 1.1% and Kingsgate is down 0.8%.

Also on the decline, aluminum-vessel maker Austal is trading 2.8% lower, even after it announced a $684 million contract with the U.S. Navy. On the other hand, Bluescope Steel is up 1%, getting some support from a weaker Australian dollar.

In about an hour, watch for NAB¡¯s monthly business survey, which could, just maybe, move shares.
