Outraged by the prices that Gilead Sciences charges for some of its medicines, an AIDS advocacy organization has succeeded in placing what is being called a unique resolution before the drug company¡¯s shareholders. The proposal ties compensation for chief executive John Martin to wider access to the drug maker¡¯s popular roster of HIV and hepatitis C treatments.

The shareholder resolution from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has previously lambasted Gilead and other drug makers over their pricing, was proposed in response to the recently approved Sovaldi pill for hepatitis C. Gilead priced its medicine at $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, which works out to $1,000 a day. As a result, AHF maintains that Sovaldi will be unaffordable for some patients.

Such concerns, in fact, prompted the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee to ask Gilead to explain the rationale behind its pricing. In a letter sent yesterday to the drug maker, the lawmakers worry that Sovaldi pricing may be too high for patients with public or private insurance. A report released last week by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that is supported, in part, by insurers, forecast that Sovaldi may negatively burden health-care budgets.
