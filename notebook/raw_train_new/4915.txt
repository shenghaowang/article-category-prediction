RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Virginia Employment Commission says the state's jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent in February.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is down from 5 percent in January and down from 5.6 percent a year ago. It is the seventh consecutive monthly decline.

Officials say February's jobless rate was the lowest since the November 2008 rate of 4.9 percent as the labor force expanded and the number of unemployed fell.

The Labor Department says unemployment rates dropped in 29 states, rose in 10 and were unchanged in the remaining 11. The national unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent in February.
