Libyan officials say they have taken "complete control" of a North Korean-flagged tanker that loaded crude oil at a port occupied by rebel forces. It was stopped as it tried to leave Sidra port but has not yet reached a government-controlled port, they add. But the rebels, who planned to sell the oil independently of the Libyan state, denied losing control of the tanker.
