TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan's unemployment rate stood at 2.4 percent in August, down from 2.5 percent the previous month to remain near the lowest level since the early 1990s, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said Friday.

The job availability ratio stood at 1.63, unchanged from July and staying at the highest level since January 1974, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said. The ratio means there were 163 openings for every 100 job seekers.

The figures represent a continuing labor crunch in the country as the fast-graying population means fewer working-age people.
