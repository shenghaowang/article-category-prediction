Comcast: We're Lobbying Congress For You, The People!

There's really no doubt that Comcast has its tendrils in deep when it comes to lobbying for approval of their $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable. The revolving door helps; former FCC boss Michael Powell now heads the NCTA, the cable industry's largest lobbying group. Former FCC Commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker, who voted for Comcast's acquisition of NBC while at the FCC, now lobbies the FCC for Comcast. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen formerly provided legal counsel for Comcast.

But the company is also throwing money hand over fist at both parties in the hopes that they can quite simply buy merger approval. Comcast PACs have given money to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and nearly all of the folks who'll be responsible with reviewing their merger application.

They've also donated to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, who'll be holding an upcoming merger hearing.

None of this is particularly surprising, given that this is how a broken democracy works. Whatsurprising is that in defending the practice, Comcast attempts to tell Politico in a roundabout way that they're doing this all for employees (who'll likely see layoffs from duplicate positions) and customers (who are more than certain to see rate hikes either way):That's a Comcast representative trying to claim that because lawmakers technically represent, throwing money at them to support a merger that likely won't help you in the slightest is perfectly ok.
