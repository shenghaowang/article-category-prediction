On May 11, Amazon Prime will be raising its annual fee from $99 to $119. If you¡¯re already a member, you¡¯ll see the increase reflected when your membership is renewed beginning June 16.

If you want to guard yourself against the 20 percent pay hike, there is a simple step you can take that will ensure your current subscription fee for the next year.

Business Insider revealed a hack that is so obvious, you¡¯ll wonder why you never figured it out yourself. Here¡¯s the deal: sometime before May 11, buy a 12-month gift subscription for $99, go to your account settings and turn off auto-renew, then redeem your gift subscription once your annual membership ends. That¡¯s it.

According to BI, you can also split the cost by splitting the annual fee with a loved one through Amazon Households. You¡¯ll have to figure out a way to split the payment, but you¡¯ll be able to share Amazon Prime perks, like waived shipping fees for two adults and up to four teens and four child profiles.

If you have access to a university ¡°.edu¡± email, then you can sign up for a free six-month trial of Prime Student and then pay 50% the price traditional subscribers pay ($6.49 per month and $78 per year) for the next four years or until your graduation date (which you include upon sign-up) ¡ª whichever comes first. However, if you¡¯re coming up on the end of a student membership (or inevitably will) it might nonetheless be a good idea to take advantage of the gift subscription workaround.

If saving yourself $20 a year is worth a little bit of a hassle, you know what to do.
