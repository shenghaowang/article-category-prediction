After moving lower over the course of the two previous sessions, stocks may see some further downside in early trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 51 points.

Considerable weakness in the overseas markets is likely to weigh on the markets, with stocks in both Asia and Europe coming under pressure on the day.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "With today's declines, most major European markets are at or below the closing lows of March 3rd, the Monday when markets finally reacted lower to Putin's war games."

"In Asia, the Shanghai, Hang Seng, Kospi, ASX, Singapore Straits and Japanese Topix are also at or near the March 3rd close but also are being influenced by China's growth concerns," he added.

While concerns about China and Ukraine are also likely to weigh on U.S. stocks, trading activity may be somewhat subdued amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front.

Traders may continue to look ahead to the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices over the next two days.

Among individual stocks, shares of Express (EXPR) are seeing significant weakness in pre-market trading after the apparel retailer reported weaker than expected fourth quarter results and provided disappointing first quarter guidance.

Russian mobile phone operator VimpelCom (VIP) may also come under pressure amid news the company is being investigated by U.S. and Dutch authorities in connection with its business in Uzbekistan.

On the other hand, shares of VeriFone (PAY) are likely to see early strength after the maker of card-payment systems reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance.

After initially showing a lack of direction, stocks moved mostly lower over the course of the trading day on Tuesday. The major averages added to the slim losses posted on Monday, with the S&P 500 pulling back further off last Friday's record highs.

The major averages climbed off their worst levels going into the close but remained firmly in the red. The Dow fell 67.43 points or 0.4 percent to 16,351.25, the Nasdaq slid 27.26 points or 0.6 percent to 4,307.19 and the S&P 500 dropped 9.54 points or 0.5 percent to 1,867.63.

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw significant weakness during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index plunged by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.7 percent.

The major European markets have also come under pressure on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has fallen by 1.2 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are down by 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.

In commodities trading, crude oil futures are falling $1.49 to $98.54 a barrel after sliding $1.09 to $100.03 a barrel on Tuesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,366.70, up $20 from the previous session's close of $1,346.70. On Tuesday, gold added $5.20.
