As the search for Malaysia Airlines jetliner enters its ninth day, here is a timeline of its last known moments in local Malaysian time, eight hours ahead of GMT, before it disappeared off the radar on Saturday March 8.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 departs from Kuala Lumpur International Airport and is due to land in Beijing at 06:30am the same day.

The plane sends its last ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) transmission which delivers engine maintenance data to ground control.

The co-pilot of the flight says "All right, good night" in the last words heard from flight MH370.

The plane drops off air traffic control screens as its transponder is switched off.

The plane failed to check in with Vietnamese aviation authorities as scheduled in Ho Chi Minh City.

Authorities later said they believe someone deliberately turned off the plane's communication systems.
