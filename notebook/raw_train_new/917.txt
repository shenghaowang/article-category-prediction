Trading firm Virtu Financial, which posted only one day of trading losses in five years, plans to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Virtu said the IPO price was an estimate solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company, a market maker in equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities markets, intends to list Class A shares on Nasdaq under the symbol "VIRT." Virtu will have three other share classes.

The underwriters for the offering include Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Sandler O'Neill Partners.

Vincent Viola, Virtu's founder and executive chairman, will control more than a majority of the combined voting power of the company's common stock after the offering.



Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which acquired its stake in 2011, is the other major shareholder.

Last year, the company paid out $433.4 million in cash distributions to members.
