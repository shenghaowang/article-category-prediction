Tavenner's agency did not disclose how many of the 5 million enrollees have paid for their insurance plans, which is required for enrollment to be official, and for benefits to be provided to a person. Insurance industry experts have estimated that between 15 to 20 percent of enrollees have not paid yet, and one expert told CNBC.com he expects that after open enrollment closes, about 10 percent of Obamacare ernollees will end up not paying for the plans they selected.
