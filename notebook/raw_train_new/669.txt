The deadline to apply for 2018 health coverage is quickly approaching and Your Health Idaho is lending a helping hand in navigating open enrollment.

When it comes to health insurance you want to make sure you have the right and affordable coverage. If you aren't covered by your workplace insurance then Your Health Idaho is your one-stop shop.

Today was the first of three open houses and more than hundreds of people have enrolled in coverage.

Tax credits are a lot higher this year along with the tax income guidelines. According to agent brokers, there are a lot of plans to choose from including no deductible options. They are here to help navigate through plans that best fit according to health needs, expenses and apply for a tax credit.

"The deadline for enrolling is December 15th, but I would highly recommend doing it before then to apply for the tax credit. You actually have to have applied by December 15th in order to qualify for the tax credit," said Amanda Davison, Agent Broker with University Financial Group.

If you missed today's open house there will be two more to attend at the Boise Public Library:

They will be free.

After an application is submitted, a plan needs to be selected and paid for by December 22nd to properly enroll.

If you cannot attend an open house you can call Your Health Idaho at (855) 944-3246 and representative will guide you.
