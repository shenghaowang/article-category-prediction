The state¡¯s new Obamacare healthcare exchange had enrolled more than 150,000 people as of March 9, surpassing its self-imposed goal of enrolling 100,000 residents by 50%.

Access Health CT is the entity established by the state of Connecticut to sign up people for healthcare coverage through the new federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Enrollment began last October.

Potential penalty for not signing up

For 2014, the federal government will assess a penalty of 1% of a gross household income over the federal income tax filing threshold or $95 per individual, whichever amount is greater.

People can sign up for healthcare insurance online at www.accesshealthct.com, or call 855-805-4325 to speak with an Access Health CT representative.
