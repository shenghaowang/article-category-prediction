Starbucks has announced a couple of new features heading to its iPhone app in a forthcoming update. To be launched into the App Store on March 19, Starbucks will be adding a new shake-to-pay feature, as well as a way to digitally tip your baristas in the U.S.

Beginning March 19, customers using Starbucks App for iPhone in the U.S., U.K. and Canada will experience a streamlined design and easy access to their account and My Starbucks Rewards information. In addition, customers using the app will have the option to leave a tip at more than 7,000 company-operated Starbucks stores in the U.S.

Shake-to-pay gives you quick access to your Starbucks card whenever you need it. By shaking your iPhone, your card will appear on the screen, at least saving you diving into Passbook to get it ¨C especially useful if you're busy doing something else at the time.

Digital tipping has apparently been a much requested feature. It's a neat idea, especially since more and more of us are moving towards using our iPhones to pay for coffee in place of cash. The app also looks like it's getting a sweet new interface ¨C check it out at the source link down below.

Grab the current version of the Starbucks app from the App Store link below, and keep an eye out for an update come March 19. What say you; digital tipping make a difference to you?
