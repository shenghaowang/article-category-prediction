A Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train early Monday morning while working on the tracks, according to report from CBS.

The employee, identified as James Romansoff, 58, was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

About 50 passengers onboard the Poughkeepsie-bound train were placed on another train and resumed their trip, the report said.

Disruptions were caused for about two hours, but service has since been restored, the report said.

Metro-North and MTA police are investigating the incident.
