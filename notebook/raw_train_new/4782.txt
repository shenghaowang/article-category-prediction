Walmart takes aim at GameStop with plan to start buying used video games from shoppers

¡ª Walmart plans to start buying used video games from shoppers at stores in a move that goes after the bread-and-butter business of GameStop.

Walmart Stores Inc. plans to expand its current online trade-in program by allowing customers to trade their used video games at 3,100 Walmart stores in exchange for credit toward the purchase of other items.

The world¡¯s largest retailer is taking aim at the $2 billion used video-game market. It¡¯s a business that¡¯s dominated by GameStop Corp., the world¡¯s biggest dedicated seller of video games with the largest and most-established video game trade-in program.

Retailers from Amazon to Best Buy also offer used video game trade-in programs. But Walmart¡¯s new program is the biggest threat to GameStop, which for the last three years has drawn roughly half of its profits from buying and selling used video games.
