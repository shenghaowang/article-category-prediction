US pizza chain Sbarro Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years as a slowdown in mall traffic weighs on sales at its fast food restaurants.

The restauranteur requested protection under Chapter 11 while it reorganizes its finances, according to a filing in US bankruptcy court in New York.

The restructuring will affect about $140 million in Sbarro debt, according to report by rating agency Fitch.

Fitch also discussed a possible bankruptcy at Quizno¡¯s, another medium-sized restaurant chain.

The Sbarro and Quizno¡¯s troubles are ¡°a warning sign of financial distress¡± confronting many brands in the restaurant industry, Fitch said.

¡°We do not view them as portending a widespread increase in bankruptcies of US restaurants, but a reflection of difficulties faced by brands that have lost their competitive position and relevancy with consumers.¡±

Both chains have suffered the growth of competitors like Subway, Little Caesars and Papa John¡¯s. In Sbarro¡¯s case, Fitch said the 68-year-old chain has also lost out from consumers moving away from shopping malls.

Sbarro last month said it was cutting 155 restaurants in North America to reduce costs.

Sbarro¡¯s 2011 bankruptcy resulted in an agreement with creditors to trim its debt from $368 million to $130 million.
