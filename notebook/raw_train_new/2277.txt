The Bank of England has partially alleviated one public relations headache with the appointment of Nemat Shafik as Mark Carney¡¯s fourth Deputy Governor.

The Bank urgently needed female representation in its senior policymaking circles. And it doesn¡¯t look like tokenism. Shafik will sit on all of the key committees and will oversee the Bank¡¯s exit from quantitative easing.

Ben Broadbent¡¯s promotion to Deputy Governor for monetary policy, replacing Charlie Bean, means another Goldman Sachs alumnus (like Carney) rises. Notable too is the effective job swap between Spencer Dale and Andy Haldane, with the former put in charge of financial stability and the latter appointed chief economist.

But what does this shake-up mean? The Bank failed to anticipate the global financial crisis. Its forecasts since the slump have been poor. Its staff apparently picked up no whiff of Libor interest rate rigging or (alleged) forex manipulation. Will this overhaul make the Bank perform better? Unless the answer is yes, this re-arrangement of Threadneedle Street furniture will mean nothing.
