Walmart to start offering in-store credit for used games

Big box retailer Walmart has announced that on March 26 it will begin accepting trade-ins of used video games for store credit that will allow customers to purchase anything in the store. Over 3,100 Walmart locations will participate in the program, though Sam's Club and neighborhood market locations will be unable to accept used games. That said, this credit will be usable at any Walmart location, and will even allow customers to purchase items online.

What's significant about this trade-in program is that it doesn't just apply to games. What that means is that although Walmart might not have as large a selection of games as Gamestop, it's still likely to take a fair chunk out of that retailer's bottom line, particularly if it offers customers a better deal for their old titles.
