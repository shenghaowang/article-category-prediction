U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat-to-higher open on Monday, after Asian stocks plunged following poor data out of both Japan and China. 



Japan's Nikkei 225 (Nihon Kenzai Shinbun: .N225) fell over 1.0 percent early in the day, after data showed the Japanese economy grew 0.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from a preliminary reading of 1.0 percent.

"It's kind of a miss. I don't think it's enough to shock the Bank of Japan into action, but it is worrying, probably because business investment is still not looking strong," HSBC Economist Izumi Devalier told CNBC Asia's " Squawk Box ."

Meanwhile, China's Shanghai Composite (Shanghai Stock Exchange: .SSEC) fell 2.9 percent, following data on Saturday that showed the country running a trade deficit of $23 billion in February. That compared to forecasts for a surplus of $14.5 billion.

In the U.S., the coming week looks set to be a quieter one for economic news, following Friday's strong-than-expected payrolls.

Few companies will report earnings on Monday, although Urban Outfitters (URBN) is due to post quarterly numbers after Wall Street closes.
