When it comes to health policy, are you a glass-half-full kind of person?

The survey shows that well over half of all uninsured Americans plan on buying health coverage in 2014. And more than 60 percent of adults aged 18 to 29 -- the demographic key to the success of the Affordable Care Act -- say they will get insurance this year.

But pessimists may instead point to the 33 percent of uninsured Americans who say they won't be buying insurance, despite the threat of a fine at the end of the year, as a failure.

And a deeper look at the responses of those Americans who say they won't buy insurance shows what could be a major failing of the Affordable Care Act's roll out.

According to the survey, roughly 70 percent of uninsured Americans are not aware that subsidies provided through the Affordable Care Act could reduce what they pay for health coverage.

"This is a staggeringly high percentage," said Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman in a release about the survey. "The government has spent over half a billion dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act and more than two-thirds of uninsured Americans still don¡¯t know about the subsidies."

Many uninsured survey takers said they would not be buying insurance because they thought it would be too expensive.

In general, opinions about the Affordable Care Act appear to be souring. According to the survey, nearly 30 percent of Americans feel more negative about the health care law than they did a year ago. Just 13 percent feel more positive about it today.
