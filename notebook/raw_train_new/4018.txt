US Navy Seals free freighter with six Pakistanis on-board

WASHINGTON: US Navy boarded and took control of commercial tanker Morning Glory which was seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans. 



The freighter with six Pakistanis including Captain Noman Baig on-board has been returned to Libya. 



No one was hurt "when US forces, at the request of both the Libyan and Cypriot governments, boarded and took control of the commercial tanker Morning Glory, a stateless vessel seized earlier this month by three armed Libyans," Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.



According to the statement, the Morning Glory was carrying a cargo of oil owned by the Libyan government National Oil Company. The ship and its cargo were illicitly obtained from the Libyan port of As-Sidra.
