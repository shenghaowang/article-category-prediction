No other car stands for Mercedes-Benz brand promise more than the S-Class and we are delighted to manufacture the new S-Class at our state-of-the art production facility in Chakan, Pune. Quality has all along been the strength of Mercedes-Benz India, and the new S 500 production in India is set to take this success story even further.

Following the commencement of local production would be the arrival of the S350 CDI diesel variant of the new gen S Class. Quite obviously, the diesel variant has good chances of becoming an even bigger sales success than the S500 petrol model.
