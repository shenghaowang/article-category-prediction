After what can only be called an epic saga, Men¡¯s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank are finally merging. In the end, it is Men¡¯s Wearhouse who today announced that it will acquire Jos. A. Bank, the smaller of the two rivals, for $1.8 billion. The deal comes after months of counterbidding, boardroom maneuvering, and shareholder tactics between the two suitors. Here¡¯s Reuters with the walk down memory lane (bolded labels added):

As part of their merger deal, Jos. A. Bank will terminate its plans to acquire Eddie Bauer, a move that was meant to bulk up the company and make it more difficult and expensive for Men¡¯s Wearhouse to buy. The companies haven¡¯t released information on potential store closings ¨C they duplicate each other in many malls ¨C but according to the Wall Street Journal, the retailers have no plans to rebrand or remodel Jos. A. Bank stores.
