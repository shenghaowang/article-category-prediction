Are you the owner of a Chevrolet Cobalt or HHR, or a Pontiac G5 or Solstice or other model affected by GM¡¯s ignition recall last month? The automaker says 13 front-seat fatalities may be related to a problem that causes the ignition key to move to the ¡°accessory¡± or ¡°off¡± position, and Congress is investigating.

In the U.S., the affected models include the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, the 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky.

If you¡¯re affected, we want to hear from you. Contact staff writer Tom Gnau at (937) 225-2390 or tom.gnau@coxinc.com.
