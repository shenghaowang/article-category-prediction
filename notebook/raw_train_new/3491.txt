There are no signs of deflation in the euro zone, but it is a possible risk, a top European Central Bank official said Wednesday.

¡°We don¡¯t see deflation in the euro zone. We see it as a possible risk, and we have to be ready to act against the risk if it materializes,¡± said Benoit Coeure, an executive board member with the ECB. He added that the central bank has a number of instruments at its disposal to address the problem.
