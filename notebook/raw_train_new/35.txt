The maker of Candy Crush Saga is set to be the most valuable British internet company to float on the stock market, after being valued at $7.6bn (4.6bn).

London games studio King Digital Entertainment will be valued at four times the company that produced Grand Theft Auto, Take-Two Interactive.

Only last month King was valued at $5.5bn, but the company said its 22.2m shares are likely to be priced between $21 and $24 each.

Senior staff will be made millionaires overnight, with investors such as Midlands-based chairman Mel Morris, who provided the initial 100m from the sale of his dating site uDate, set to own 523m in shares from his 12.2% stake.

Co-founder and chief executive Riccardo Zacconi will own 455m worth of shares from a 10.4% stake.

A total of 11 other investors will own 1.4bn in shares between them.

Previously the company was involved in a dispute with an independent games maker after he claimed King stole the concept for Candy Crush.
