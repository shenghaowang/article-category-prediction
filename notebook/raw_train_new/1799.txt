Asian markets slumped today, after China reported over the weekend weaker-than-expected February exports data. February exports slumped 18% from a year ago, surprising the market which had expected a 5% increase.

In addition, Beijingweakened its daily reference rate against the dollar by the largest since 2012, in another attempt to break the one-way bet of yuan and halt the hot flow of offshore money into China. The offshore yuan dropped to 6.13 per dollar from 6.10 on Friday.

Asia equities slumped today on renewed concerns over a China slowdown. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index was down 1.7%, the Shanghai Composite Stock Market Index slumped 2.9%. Taiwan and South Korea followed China lower as well. The Taiwan TAIEX Index lost 0.6%. The KOSPI Composite Index retreated 1%.
