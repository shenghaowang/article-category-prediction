The Mercedes B-Class was introduced nearly three years ago, so the company is preparing a minor facelift for the model.

Caught undergoing cold weather testing, the facelifted model appears to feature a new front bumper, a revised grille and restyled head and taillights. We can also see a new exhaust system that is better integrated into the rear bumper.

Our spies couldn't get close enough to snap interior photos but the car is expected to feature minor changes and an updated infotainment system.

Engine options will likely carryover but there could be some modifications for improved performance and reduced fuel consumption.

The facelifted B-Class could be introduced later this year, so look for a possible debut at the Paris Motor Show.
