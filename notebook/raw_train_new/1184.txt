DENVER ¨C Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in the world¡¯s first accounting of the recreational pot business.

The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold from 59 businesses. The state collected roughly $2.01 million in taxes.

Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana didn¡¯t begin until January. Washington sales begin in coming months.

The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent excise taxes. Including licensing fees and taxes from Colorado¡¯s pre-existing medical marijuana industry, the state collected about $3.5 million from the marijuana industry in January.

That¡¯s a relative drop in the bucket for Colorado¡¯s roughly $20 billion annual budget, but still a windfall that has numerous interests holding out their hands. By comparison, Colorado made about $2.7 million in liquor excise taxes in January of last year.

Colorado tax officials say the January marijuana reports were in line with expectations.

Monday¡¯s tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana industry to be volatile for several years, making lawmakers nervous about where to direct the funds.
