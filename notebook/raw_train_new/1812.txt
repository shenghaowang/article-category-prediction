American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (NYSE: AEO) reported fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results before markets opened Tuesday. The specialty clothing retailer reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 and revenues of $1.04 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $0.55 on revenue of $1.12 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $0.26 and $1.03 billion in revenue.

For the full year, American Eagle reported EPS of $0.74 on revenues of $3.31 billion, compared with EPS of $1.39 on revenues of $3.48 billion in 2012. The 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year included an extra week, compared with 2013. The consensus estimates called for EPS of $0.73 on revenues of $3.3 billion.

The share price was sinking Tuesday morning because the company¡¯s comments on its first-quarter outlook include a ¡°high single-digit decline¡± in same-store sales. Earnings are expected to break even, compared with EPS of $0.18 a year ago and a consensus estimate of $0.13. That was all it took to send shares tumbling.

The Company¡¯s results in 2013 were highly disappointing. While tough macro conditions have persisted in our retail sector, our merchandise and overall customer experience fell short of expectations. We¡¯re taking steps to bring greater focus and excitement to our product offering and better engage our core customers. Our brands remain incredibly strong and I¡¯m confident in our ability to execute the strategic plan and resume long-term profitable growth.

Shares traded down about 6.8% Tuesday morning, at $13.24 in a 52-week range of $12.59 to $21.07. Thomson Reuters had a consensus analyst price target of around $16.20 before the results were announced.
