PARIS¡ªBouygues SA said Thursday it has improved its offer for Vivendi SA's phone unit, reopening a bidding war that had appeared closed when Vivendi selected a rival offer less than a week ago

Bouygues said it was raising the cash component of its offer to 13.15 billion ($18.19 billion), from 11.3 billion previously, as part of a proposal to merge SFR with Bouygues's telecommunications unit, France's Nos. 2 and 3 mobile operators by subscribers.
