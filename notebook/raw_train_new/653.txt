More Americans rode trains, buses, streetcars and subways last year than at any time since 1956. That's according to new figures released by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). In fact, more than 10.7 billion journeys were made by public transit nationally, and transit ridership is up 37.2 percent since 1995.

So what's going on?

Certainly, as the APTA notes, the economic recovery will be playing a role. But there are broader trends that point to a long-term growth in ridership, including increased urbanization.

Here's how The Guardian explains the shift:

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation¡¯s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs. ¡°People want to work and live along transit lines,¡± said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. ¡°Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.¡±

Public transit in the U.S.: Why are so many Americans riding again?

As the economy recovers from recession, more people are riding transit again. But there are other, long-term reasons for growth too.
