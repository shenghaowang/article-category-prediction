The pizza restaurant chain Sbarro filed for bankruptcy Monday for the second time in less than three years.

The Melville, N.Y.-based company has between $100 million and $500 million in assets and liabilities, according to court papers, which it signed over along with 30 affiliates for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The pizza chain previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011.

Sbarro said last month it would cut costs by closing 155 of its around 400 restaurants it owns in North America.
