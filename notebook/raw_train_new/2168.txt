Mobile payments may not be catching on as quickly as we¡¯d like, but one company is leading the pack when it comes to buying things with your smartphone. The Starbucks mobile app already lets customers store money on their accounts and pay with their phones, and a new update for its iOS app lets you tip with your iPhone or shake the device to make paying for your coffee an even quicker experience.

Tipping with the Starbucks app on iOS requires just a few extra taps, offering the option to give your barista 50 cents, $1 or $2. You can also jump straight to your Starbucks Card barcode by opening the app and quickly shaking your phone. For now these new features are restricted to the company¡¯s iOS app, though Starbucks says Android should see a similar update later this year.

The company also took the opportunity to highlight the app¡¯s popularity, noting that more than 11 percent of Starbucks transactions are now completed using a mobile device. Earlier this year the coffee giant came under fire after a security flaw was exposed, though the company claims it has since fixed the issue.
