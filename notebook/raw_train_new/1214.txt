JC Penney (JCP) has been down so long it's finally looking up, especially after a Citigroup upgrade today.

Citigroup's Oliver Chen and team explain why they raised their rating on JC Penney's shares:

JC Penney wasn't the only retailer getting some love today: Macy's (M), was raised to Outperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo, while Aeropostale (ARO) was started as a Buy at Buckingham Research. Urban Outfitters (URBN), however, has dropped after making downbeat comments about the first quarter, while American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) has fallen after it offered disappointing guidance.

Shares of JC Penney have gained 8.5% to $9.13 at 10:22 a.m. today, while Macy's has risen 2.3% to $59.46 and Aeropostale is up 2.3% at $7.16. Urban Outfitters has fallen 4.3% to $35.88 and American Eagle Outfitters has dropped 6.5% to $13.27.
