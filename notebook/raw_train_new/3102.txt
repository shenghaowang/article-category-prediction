For Starbucks baristas, there was always one reason to resent ringing up a customer with with a Starbucks app or credit card: they couldn¡¯t add a tip.

That¡¯s about to change with their next app update. On March 19, customers will be able to tip the barista up to two hours after they were rung up for their latte.

Using the iPhone app, customers are given the option to provide a tip $0.50, $1.00, or $2.00.

The Seattle-based coffee giant says digital tipping has been a top suggestion on MyStarbucksIdea.com.

While digital tipping will be available to the updated app on iPhones in March, Starbucks expects to introduce the digital tipping feature to that audience later this year. An app is not currently available for the Windows Phone.
