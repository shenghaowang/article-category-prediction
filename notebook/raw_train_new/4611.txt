Starting March 26, Wal-Mart will allow shoppers to trade in used video games in order to purchase anything in both Wal-Mart and Sams Club, both in stores or online.

The store will accept games for Sony PlayStation 3, Microsoft Xbox 360 and other popular consoles.

Since gaming is an important part of Wal-Marts business, the store will then refurbish the used games and sell them later this year.

Best Buy Co., Target Corp., and GameStop are among other stores that offer similar trade-in programs for used video games.
