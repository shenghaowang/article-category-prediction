The back-and-forth jostling between Men¡¯s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank that first came to light in October has finally come to a close: Men¡¯s Wearhouse said it will buy Jos. A. Bank for $65 a share in cash, or a total of $1.8 billion.

The final purchase price is up from the most recent $63.50 bid Jos. A. Bank had rejected in late February and also marked a 56% premium over Jos. A. Bank¡¯s closing price on Oct. 8, a day before it announced its attempt to buy its larger rival that set off a soap-opera-like quid pro quo.

With its deal with Men¡¯s Wearhouse /quotes/zigman/233713/delayed /quotes/nls/mw MW , Jos. A. Bank /quotes/zigman/56759/delayed /quotes/nls/josb JOSB announced its deal to buy Eddie Bauer is being terminated, with Eddie Bauer set to collect a $48 million termination fee.

The transaction will create the fourth-largest men¡¯s clothing retailer in the U.S., after Macy¡¯s /quotes/zigman/467976/delayed /quotes/nls/m M , Kohl¡¯s /quotes/zigman/231595/delayed /quotes/nls/kss KSS , and J.C. Penney /quotes/zigman/237947/delayed /quotes/nls/jcp JCP , Men¡¯s Wearhouse said. It will have more than 1,700 stores in the U.S., about 23,000 employees and combined sales of $3.5 billion before any consolidation, the company said. Men¡¯s Wearhouse said getting rid of duplicate corporate functions, consolidating merchandising buying and other purchases will help lead to annual cost savings of as much as $150 million. Jos. A. Bank banner will remain in place. Men¡¯s Wearhouse CEO Doug Ewert is expected to lead the combined company, a person familiar with the situation said.

In a prior presentation with investors, Men¡¯s Wearhouse, with $2.5 billion in sales and 1,140 stores, said it targets 25-55 year olds who are ¡°style conscious and contemporary.¡¯ That compares with Jos. A. Bank¡¯s 35-55-year old customers who are after styles that are more ¡°traditional and conservative.¡± Men¡¯s Wearhouse¡¯s target customer is less affluent with annual household income of $75,000 versus Jos. A. Bank¡¯s $100,000 to $125,000 household income.

Men¡¯s Wearhouse, with a loyalty program, also is expected to create a customer reward program under the Jos. A. Bank banner.

¡°There are a ton of potential synergies, not least of which include rationalizing stores 2-3 blocks apart,¡± said Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson. ¡°This can be a real win-win for both firms.¡±

The company said management will consist of the ¡°most qualified individuals.¡± Men¡¯s Wearhouse said it has a ¡°proven track record¡± of acquisitions, having integrated about 600 stores and over 7,000 employees in its prior purchases of Joseph Abboud, After Hours and Moores. The company said its purchase is not conditioned on any financing and said it expects to fund the purchase, expected to close by the third quarter, with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and committed debt financing from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan.
