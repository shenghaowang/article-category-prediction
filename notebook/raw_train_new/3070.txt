Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) has declared a lock out on its plants located in Bidadi, Karnataka, due to labor agitations. In a statement released by the company last evening, TKM says that the management and union have been discussing the charter of demands for the period FY 13-14 for the past 10 months.

However, an agreement was not reached even after the intervention of the Labor Department of the Government of Karnataka. In the meantime, TKM says that certain sections of its employees have "resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors". This has been ongoing for the past 25 days, says the company.

In a move to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel, TKM has declared a lockout of the premises. Production of cars in both plants have come to a halt now.

Toyota's first plant, established in 1997, began producing cars since December 1999. The plant has an installed capacity of 100,000 units and makes the Innova and Fortuner. TKM's second plant started producing cars in December 2010 and makes the Etios, Etios Liva, Corolla, Camry and Camry Hybrid. The second plant has a capacity of 210,000 units.
