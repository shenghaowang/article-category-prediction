The mortgage interest rates published by banks are normally affected by the change in the prices of mortgage backed financial bonds and securities, which follow the stock market movements closely. As the stock market waned by the end of the trading day and left the DJIA index at 15337.70, the bank moved along the same direction and quoted its lending rates. However, regardless of the interest rates, the stock price of BBT shares reached a new price mark of 35.72 after a hike of +0.40 today.
