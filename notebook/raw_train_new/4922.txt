Starting March 26, gamers will be able to trade in used games at Walmart which will in turn begin being sold to the public later this year.

The process is simple: bring in your used game, with its original packaging, to the electronics department of any of the 3,100 Walmart stores across the United States. An associate will scan your game and give it a once-over to determine its value before providing you with a credit voucher that can be used in any Walmart or Sam's Club both in store and online. Your trade-in will then be refurbished and sold as a used title beginning "later this year."

Unlike GameStop, however, Walmart will not offer the option of receiving cash for game trade-ins, nor will it accept video game hardware.

¡°Gaming continues to be an important business for us and we¡¯re actively taking aim at the $2 billion pre-owned video game opportunity,¡± Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Walmart U.S., said in a press release. ¡°When we disrupt markets and compete, our customer wins. They¡¯ll save money on video games and have the flexibility to spend it however they want.¡±

Walmart has tested the used game market in the past; it previously had a small, kiosk-based game trading system located in some of it stores.
