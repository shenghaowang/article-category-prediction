Hertz Rental Car Holding Co. said Monday that its long-anticipated plan to split off its equipment-rental business as a separate company will take effect June 30.

The company will retain control of the rental car brands more known to consumers, including Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty, under a new corporate name: Hertz Global Holdings. It will shift its equipment-rental operations to an entity called Herc Holdings.

The Hertz board approved the move, the company said Monday in a statement, more than two years after initially announcing plans for a split.

The move comes as the rental-car industry is facing the onslaught of ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft, which threaten to undermine the rental-car business model.

"The creation of these two public companies enables each to focus on their respective core businesses, thereby increasing the opportunity for both to create optimal shareholder value," Hertz Global Holdings CEO John Tague said in a statement.

Hertz Global Holdings, which operates about 9,980 company-owned and franchised rental operations in about 150 countries, will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the current symbol, HTZ.

Herc Holdings will trade on NYSE under the symbol HRI. Herc's equipment-rental business serves companies in energy, construction, manufacturing, civil infrastructure and other industries. Its businesses had revenue of about $1.7 billion in 2015.
