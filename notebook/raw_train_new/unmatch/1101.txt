Dick¡¯s Sporting Goods Inc. is feeling the broader struggles of the retail industry, but the market is unfairly pricing in a blowout defeat in Tuesday¡¯s earnings report.

Shares are down 15% over the past three months. That is worse than rivals, measured by the SPDR Retail exchange traded fund¡¯s 8% decline. It is also far below the S&P 500¡¯s 7% gain over the same period. With Dick¡¯s capitalizing on recent bankruptcies among its sporting-goods rivals, this selloff looks overdone.
