Stocks closed lower on Monday after President Donald Trump said an announcement on U.S.-China trade will be coming after the close. Steep losses in some of the biggest tech shares also pressured the broader market.

Trump said he has great respect for Chinese President Xi Jinping, but the U.S. deficit was too big. "We can't do that anymore," Trump said.

The comments come after director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow told CNBC's Becky Quick that Trump has "not been satisfied" with the trade talks with Beijing. "The president has suggested tariffs on a couple $100 billion" in Chinese goods, Kudlow said. "He has not been satisfied with the talks with China on this. My guess is that an announcement will be coming soon."
