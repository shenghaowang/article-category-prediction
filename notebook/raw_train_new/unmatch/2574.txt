Herbalife says Ackman's accusations have never had merit Herbalife commented on a March 10 New York Times report 'After Big Bet, Hedge Fund Pulls the Levers of Power,' by Michael S. Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson. The article details how Bill Ackman of Pershing Square has employed a sophisticated and unprecedented campaign to exert pressure on lawmakers and regulators to investigate and destroy Herbalife, all to protect the $1B bet he made against the company. Herbalife issued the following statement: "For the past 15 months, Bill Ackman has executed an unfounded, relentless and fraudulent public attack on Herbalife's business model, blasting Herbalife to any media outlet or hedge fund audience willing to listen. As The New York Times reports, Ackman has, out of desperation, shifted his focus from Wall Street to Washington and key states across the country. Ackman's unprecedented campaign to destroy Herbalife has now been exposed for what it is: a cynical, self-serving attempt to manipulate the market by buying his way into an investigation to cover his own reckless $1 billion dollar bet. There has never been merit to his accusations. Now we know how he has been orchestrating the appearance of outrage and concern. There should be no question any longer about Ackman's motives, his techniques and his goals."
