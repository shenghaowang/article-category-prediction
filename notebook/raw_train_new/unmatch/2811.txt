US and Ukrainian officials have rejected suggestions that de facto Moscow-controlled eastern Ukraine could hold a referendum on its status, after Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly suggested the idea to US counterpart Donald Trump.

He made the proposal to Mr Trump in Helsinki on Monday, when they spoke for two hours with only interpreters present, according to reports quoting sources at a subsequent meeting between Mr Putin and Russian diplomats.
