We begin by taking a look back at How The Great Recession Changed Banking, looking at the highlights from our recent Harvard Business Review article on the topic, which finds that returns on equity have halved while capital ratios have doubled in the wholesale banking business. We look at what has driven the change, and what will drive change going forward.

Next up, we provide three drill downs on the themes from our recent European banking report, including insights into how digital can improve the customer journey through the loan application process, our views on the future workforce, and the growing attention on data security in the wake of cyberattacks.

Finally, we focus on the agenda for 2018 and beyond. The year 2018 will see key EU regulations such as MiFID II and GDPR come into force. We believe the industry still has much work ahead to meeting these requirements, both in terms of addressing the immediate need to be compliant and in the longer-term impact the regulations will have on the banking sector. Likewise, the compliance functions have a lot to do to develop new monitoring schemes to ensure the new rules are met. In our view, banking has a long way to go before it reaches next-generation compliance, which will require a more systemized and automated approach. The final Basel IV package has now been announced, but will not become effective until it is embedded in national/European laws and regulation. Therefore, engagement with European regulators on the topic will be critical in the coming months.

Our longer- term regulatory outlook for financial services highlights the new regulatory and political equilibrium following the move from multilateralism and free trade to more domestically focused policies.
