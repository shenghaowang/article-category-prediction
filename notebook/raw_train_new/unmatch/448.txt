Today the MH370 crash is described as an accident, yet what really caused the plane to fail remains as much of a mystery today as four years ago. At the beginning of 2018, US-based company Ocean Infinity was hired by the Malaysian government to begin searching for the plane once more. However, a few months later and little progress has been made, with relatives of those lost frustrated as ever over the missing answers. As conspiracy theories spread, here are five things we¡¯ll never know about flight MH3370.

The reason why the plane crashed This is the biggest question mark hanging over the disappearance and is one that aviation experts are so desperate to answer. Just 26 minutes into the flight the plane sent out its last ever transmission before the radar in the cockpit was shut down. No contact from the pilots gave any warning as to a problem with the plane and as they the plane has yet to be found, this is likely to remain the case. The location of the plane now When the connection was lost, the plane was switching between Malaysian air traffic control into Vietnamese airspace and was reported to be flying over the South China Sea. Although just a few months into their own search for the flight, Ocean Infinity has made little process in tracking down the plane.

The reason communication systems were shut down After it¡¯s last transmitted contact, the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was manually shut down. Investigators are still drawing blanks as to why this happened as it goes against flight policy. Why the plane deviated from its flight path Back in 2014, the Thai government reported that the missing Malaysia Airlines flight took a sharp turn left after communication was lost. In a conversation with CNN in 2014, a law enforcement officer reported: ¡°The aircraft's first turn to the west was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit.¡±
