HONG KONG ¡ª One of the surest bets on China is starting to look a bit shaky.

Every business day for the last nine years, at 9 a.m., government workers in the blandly named Building No. 30 in Shanghai¡¯s Pudong financial district have published what their country¡¯s currency will be worth that day, when compared with the United States dollar.

More often than not, the staff of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System has assigned a value to the currency, the renminbi, slightly stronger than it had finished the previous day. Thanks to the guiding hand of the Chinese state, the renminbi today is about 25 percent stronger than it was in July 2005, when China scrapped the currency¡¯s fixed peg to the dollar in favor of a steady, crawling appreciation.

But recent developments suggest such strengthening is no longer the certainty it once appeared to be. So far this year, the renminbi has weakened 1.6 percent against the dollar. And on Saturday, the central bank, the People¡¯s Bank of China, said that beginning on Monday, it would allow the currency to climb or fall as much as 2 percent per day against the dollar, compared with 1 percent previously.

Widening the trading band ¡°will further drive away speculators betting on a one-way appreciation of the Chinese yuan¡± ¡ª another name for the renminbi ¡ª ¡°thanks to the possible bigger and more frequent exchange rate fluctuations,¡± Tan Yaling, president of the China Forex Investment Research Institute, told Xinhua, the state-run news agency, on Sunday.
