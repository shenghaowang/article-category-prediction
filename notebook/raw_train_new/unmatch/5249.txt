SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Trade frictions with the United States and accusations of industrial espionage are set to cast a cloud over China's largest aerospace meeting this week, as suppliers consider what the country's slowing economy could mean for booming jet demand. The biennial Airshow China, to be held in the coastal city of Zhuhai during Nov 6-11, is traditionally an event for Beijing to parade its growing aviation prowess in front of aerospace executives, diplomats and arms buyers from over 40 countries. While the tarmac will be filled with planes from the likes of Airbus SA (AIR.PA) and Embraer (EMBR3.SA), the main symbol of China's own commercial aviation ambitions, the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China's (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] C919 narrow body jet, will not be there.
