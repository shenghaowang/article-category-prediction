You might qualify for down payment assistance based on a number of factors. Some of these factors could be self-evident, and others could require some research on your part.

For example, veterans and active military can apply for a Veterans Administration loan. Since the federal government guarantees these loans, they don't require a down payment.

If you live in certain areas, Rural Development loans can be guaranteed by the USDA. These loans wouldn't require a down payment, but instead, have a smaller one-time fee that can be incorporated into the mortgage. However, your income has to fall within a certain range of the median salaries in the area, the property needs to have an eligible location, and many more conditions apply. First, you'll want to consult the USDA Rural Development eligibility map (opens in a new tab) about the property, and then find out if you qualify.

In all cases, ask your mortgage lender about your down payment assistance options. Then do some extra research to find out about programs that might be able to help you.
