Any homeowner on a variable-rate mortgage will take an immediate hit in the pocket if the Bank of England raises interest rates today.

But that¡¯s only around one in ten households in the UK, compared to around 20% a decade ago.

That¡¯s partly because more people have fixed mortgages today. It also reflects the generational divide - older people have paid off their mortgages and own outright, while many young adults haven¡¯t been able to get onto the housing ladder at all.

Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, has written a blogpost about this, explaining how the short-term impact of a rate rise is limited.



The combination of these three trends ¨C falling home ownership, growing outright ownership, and the shift towards fixed rate mortgages ¨C means that only around 11 per cent of families have variable rate mortgages in Britain today. And they have smaller mortgage balances than those that have fixed ¨C an average of 70,000 compared to 96,000. To estimate the overnight mortgage impact of a rate rise, we can look at what happens if we add 0.25 percentage points to the interest rates paid by the 11 per cent of families with non-fixed rate mortgages. The result is an average increase in repayments of families of 6.40 a month (or 1.3 per cent of their existing repayments). Spreading the cost across all mortgage holders, the average repayment increase is just 2.50 a month.

Eventually, a rate rise will feed through to more borrowers as fixed-rate mortgage deals are renewed.



But still, raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% certainly isn¡¯t a repeat of Black Wednesday in 1992, when rates were hiked from 10% to 15% (and back again, after Britain crashed out of the exchange-rate mechanism).
