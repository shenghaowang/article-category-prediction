Investor William Ackman took another blow in his crusade against Herbalife Ltd., as the nutritional products company struck a settlement with regulators that, while critical of the firm, stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme.

Herbalife agreed with the Federal Trade Commission to pay $200 million to settle government allegations it misled consumers. Herbalife, which Mr. Ackman has called a ¡°criminal enterprise,¡± will be allowed to stay in business.
