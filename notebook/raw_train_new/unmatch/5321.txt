Mike Owen, executive director of the non-profit Iowa Policy Project in Iowa City, said in a news release that Iowa needs sustained job growth to fully recover from the last recession, which ended seven years ago.

¡°Iowa¡¯s monthly job change has averaged between 1,500 and 1,800 for each of the last five calendar years, and so far in 2016, about 1,200 a month through the first half of the year,¡± Owen said. ¡°Over the last 12 months, that average is about 1,800.

¡°Either way, the current pace is too slow to catch up with population growth any time soon.¡±
