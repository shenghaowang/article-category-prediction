Shares of First Solar (FSLR) jumped Wednesday after receiving an upgrade and price-target increase based on rising demand seen in China.

First Solar surged 6.7% to close at 77.58 on the stock market today. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith upgraded First Solar to buy from neutral and raised his price target to 83 from 75.

Dumoulin-Smith sees demand for solar energy in China rising this year. He says that will be "holding up the global panel pricing environment yet again," with domestic pricing holding firm.

First Solar reported fourth-quarter results in February that fell far short on revenue views but beat on the bottom line.

Meanwhile, another U.S.-based solar stock, SunPower (SPWR), soared by nearly 12% to 9.34, following the announcement of an acquisition. SunPower said it agreed to buy Oregon-based SolarWorld Americas, a leading U.S. manufacturer of solar panels. An acquisition price was not specified.

SolarWorld is one of two solar companies, the other being Suniva, that won a legal challenge last year focused on imports of solar panels from China. The suit determined that China set prices below what U.S. companies could achieve.

In September, the U.S. International Trade Commission agreed that imports of solar panels from China have caused injury to domestic manufacturers. Suniva and SolarWorld claimed that the cheap solar modules imported from China led to their bankruptcy filing. The ITC ruling led to President Trump's decision to impose tariffs of 30% on imported solar panel technology.

The solar industry has been buffeted by an oversupply of solar modules and panels over the past few years, causing manufacturers to slash pricing.
