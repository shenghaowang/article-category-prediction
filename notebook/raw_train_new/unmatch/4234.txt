Kroger bringing Toys 'R' Us exclusives to stores for the holidays

Kroger Co. said Friday that it will stock nearly 600 stores with items from Geoffrey's Toy Box, merchandise that was once exclusive to the bankrupt Toys 'R' Us chain. The items will range in price from $19.99 to $49.99 and will include merchandise from brands like Animal Zone and Journey Girls. This is the first holiday season without Toys 'R' Us and retailers including J.C. Penney Co. Inc. , Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. have stepped up their toy departments to fill the void and gain market share. Kroger shares have gained nearly 7% in the year so far, outpacing the S&P 500 index , which is up 2.5% for the period.
