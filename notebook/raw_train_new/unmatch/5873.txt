The Royal Arms is one of the most recognisable designs seen on sterling in the UK.

It was issued in 1983, and went through four further re-issues.

But there is one in particular that is worth significantly more than one pound.

The 2008 version is the third rarest of all one pound coins, with 3.9million made.
