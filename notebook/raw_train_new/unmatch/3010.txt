George Osborne under pressure to appoint a woman as the Bank's new deputy governor as Charlie Bean retires

George Osborne is today expected to name Charlie Bean¡¯s successor as deputy governor of the Bank of England. 



Bean, 60, is scheduled to retire on June 30 and the Chancellor is under pressure to appoint a woman to the 260,000-a-year job. 



Those in the frame are thought to include Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor at London Business School who formerly headed the European Central Bank¡¯s research department. 



A number of senior officials already at the Bank have also been linked with the job, including chief economist Spencer Dale, executive director for markets Paul Fisher, and Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who sits on the monetary policy committee. 



But the selection of a woman could be a political coup for Osborne on the eve of his fifth Budget as Chancellor. The nine-strong MPC has not included a woman since Kate Barker left in 2010. 



There has never been a female governor and there has not been a female deputy governor since Rachel Lomax left in 2008. 



Governor Mark Carney has said he wants to recruit more women into senior roles at the Bank. He has already hired Charlotte Hogg to become the first chief operating officer in the central bank¡¯s history. She has also been linked with the deputy governor¡¯s position.
