McDonald's reacted angrily yesterday to a lawsuit accusing the fast food giant of hiding the truth about its ingredients and the risks posed to customers.

One month after a judge threw out a case filed on behalf of obese teenagers, an amended lawsuit claims McDonald's deceives customers with advertising that suggests the food is nutritious.

McDonald's dubbed the suit senseless, absurd and "a serious disservice to anyone who is looking for real answers and information about healthy lifestyles, energy balance and personal responsibility".

The claimants were encouraged when US district judge Robert Sweet called chicken nuggets "McFrankenstein" food, even though he rejected the first claim.

The new suit alleges that McDonald's described its Filet-O-Fish as "100pc cod with a pinch of salt to taste" in brochures. In fact it contains dextrose, cellulose gum, citric acid, modified cornstarch and other, unpronounceable, ingredients, says the lawsuit.

The fast food industry is extremely nervous that the slightest sign of victory for the litigants will lead to a flood of claims from people with health problems who happen to eat hamburgers. Until now, legal attacks on McDonald's and rivals such as Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken have been all-but laughed out of court.

America's National Restaurant Association said in a statement: "Lawsuits that have been repeatedly filed by the same trial attorney will do nothing to help those Americans who have problems with their weight."

Lawyer Samuel Hirsch said he is merely seeking a "reasonable" settlement from McDonald's, which would include funds to educate consumers.

McDonald's lost one of America's most infamous lawsuits back in 1992, when a customer who was severely burned by a spilt coffee was awarded $2.7m in damages. The award was later reduced to $500,000.
