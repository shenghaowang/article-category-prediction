Many treasures reside deep in the storage facilities of the Riverside Metropolitan Museum (RMM). One of these treasures is a collection of ceramic figurines and other artifacts from an ancient civilization just outside of what is now Mexico City. These artifacts come from Tlatilco (Tla-teel-ko), one of the earliest complex societies of Central Mexico that flourished about 3,000 years ago. These treasures will be featured in a collaborative exhibition of the RMM¡¯s artifacts hosted at the Riverside Art Museum (RAM)¡­
