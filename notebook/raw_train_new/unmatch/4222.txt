SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc Chief Executive John Donahoe will get an exit package worth an estimated $23 million after the company splits from payments unit PayPal next year, according to an agreement highlighted in a securities filing on Thursday.

Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan will get an exit package worth about $12 million. The figures could change depending on the performance of eBay¡¯s share price next year.

Both Donahoe and Swan said they would step down from their current roles in September, when eBay announced its planned split with PayPal.

¡°John¡¯s transition package is closely tied to the performance of the company during the separation period and the company¡¯s stock price at the time of separation,¡± eBay spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement.

The terms were approved by eBay¡¯s board on Dec. 15. Other executives may also step down after the company splits its marketplace division from PayPal. Those other executives who leave will get benefits including a cash payment equivalent to 1.5 times their annual base salary, the filing said.
