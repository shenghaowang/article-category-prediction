Bloomberg ¨C European investors are backing Excalibur Funds Management Pty¡¯s call for the Australian dollar to slump to 75 U.S. cents, reflecting record bets from speculators on declines in the currency.

Institutional investors placed $200 million with the Sydney-based hedge fund¡¯s Australian dollar-only strategy since it started July 17, Matthew Harper, a principal and trader at Excalibur, said in an interview Aug. 22. Hedge funds and other speculators swung from record bets on Aussie gains in December to the most wagers ever this month that the currency will fall.
