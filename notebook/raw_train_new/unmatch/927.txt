Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, financial markets, the eurozone and the business world.

Shares have jumped in Asia overnight after the Turkish central bank stunned the markets with a huge hike in borrowing costs late last night, in a bid to prop up its currency.

The lira immediately staged a rally -- and has recovered to 2.17 to the US dollar, above the important 2.2 mark. It had hit a series of record lows in recent days, even falling below 2.36 before the Turkish central bank announced it would hold last night's emergency meeting.
