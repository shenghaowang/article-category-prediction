Gold prices today are also greatly affected by the demand for Gold in jewelry. Jewelry made up about 46 percent of Gold demand worldwide Q1 2017 ¨C up from Q1 2016. This demand for Gold is due to Gold being seen as an enduring gift for weddings, festivals and other special events, and typically results in a strong 1 oz Gold price. In Q1 2016, when Gold jewelry demand hit a seven-year low, it was still at 45% of the total Gold demand. In addition, determining what is the current price of Gold is affected by industrial demand, like the manufacture of medical devices, such as stents, and electronics, such as GPS units. Finally, the Gold coin price and Gold bar price are affected by how much Gold is available, which was at 186,700 tons of above-ground stock at the end of Q1 2017.

There are no close-of-business Gold prices, although some firms capture a "closing Gold price."

Trading goes from 6 p.m. (ET) to 5:15 p.m. (ET), Sunday to Friday, with markets closing for 45 minutes on weekdays.

What is a premium Gold bar price and Gold coin price, and why do I have to pay it?

You will see the Gold price spot today per ounce and wonder why you have to pay a premium Gold price. The premium current Gold pricing reflects the spot price plus the costs of fabrication, distribution and a minimal dealer fee. The Gold coin price can also include numismatic or collectible Gold value. Any numismatic value can considerably add to the Gold price per gram or ounce. The rarer the coin, the higher the Gold coin values and therefore the higher the premium price. Of course, the good news is the value of Gold coins can also go up more dramatically when you sell later. Gold coin price premiums include considerations for scarcity, quality, demand and intangible factors like appeal because of artistic or historic Gold coin value. Many investors consider Gold bullion the best investment because bullion has a lower premium without numismatic value. Favorite Gold bullion selections include:

What does numismatic value mean when you are looking at the Gold ounce price premium?

When you begin investing in Gold, you must determine if you want Gold only for its raw Gold value or if you want to also collect Gold coins and other products that have a numismatic value. Numismatic is just a fancy term for the collectible aspect of coins, paper currency, medals or related bullion objects. Gold coin prices are higher if the coin has a numismatic value. When you look at the Gold prices chart, you will find the spot Gold price, which is the base price. To that spot price for Gold, add costs for fabrication, distribution, a nominal dealer markup and numismatic value, which combine to give you the premium Gold price you pay.

Why can't I buy at the Gold spot price? Is the dealer making a lot of money on my purchase?

You can't buy at the spot price of Gold by the ounce because the spot price does not include the costs of fabrication, distribution, a small dealer markup and any numismatic or collector Gold value added for highly sought-after Gold coins. The Gold bar value is typically very easy to determine because it is based on the spot Gold price you will find on a Gold price history chart, plus fabrication, distribution and a small dealer markup.

But Gold coin values are harder to estimate because they rely on where the coins were minted, the quantity of coins minted, the current coin condition, the desirability of the coins and more. As a result for dealers, the premium for Gold coin prices, that is, the price on top of the Gold spot price, is also more than premium prices for Gold bars, and Gold coin values can be significantly higher for highly sought-after Gold coins.

Sovereign Gold bullion coins are manufactured by governments around the world and Gold coin values when in circulation are simply the face values stamped on these coins. These popular coins also often have numismatic value, or collector Gold value, which means the Gold price exceeds the face value. In the U.S., no Gold coins have been in legal circulation since 1933 when President Roosevelt prohibited their circulation as currency. Vintage sovereign coins like American Saint-Gaudens Gold coins have far greater value than the basic bar of Gold value. Other popular sovereign coins that have a higher premium price over the spot Gold price per troy ounce include Canadian Maple Leaf Coins, South African Krugerrands and Austrian Philharmonics.

How do I compare the current price of Gold?

When you compare the price of Gold, make sure you are comparing troy ounces to troy ounces. Gold is typically sold in troy ounces (which weigh about one-tenth more than regular ounces), but sometimes you will see the Gold price per gram or other Gold price measurements. Make sure you know the rate you are looking at is the Gold price in troy ounces. In addition, the current Gold price for a coin can be higher than the current price of Gold bullion, including:

That is because the price you pay for a Gold item takes into consideration more than the raw value of Gold. In addition to the 1 oz Gold coin value, there is often a numismatic value, or collectibility premium, for a higher current price of Gold per ounce for coins and higher historical Gold prices for collectible Gold coins.

What is the Gold price quoting exactly?

When looking at Gold prices, make sure you understand what is being quoted. Most of the time, Gold value is quoted in troy ounces in U.S. dollars (USD). On occasion, you will discover some websites list Gold prices per gram or kilo. Check out the various 1 oz troy coins offered at APMEX, like the American Gold Eagle coins, South African Gold Krugerrands or the Austrian Philharmonic coins. If you see the price of Gold listed in grams and kilo, it is calculated based on the troy ounce metric.

Is it worth it to buy a gram of Gold?

Any purchase of Gold is worth it because there is a large store of value associated with the Precious Metal. A gram of Gold is a good way to get started investing in Gold because of its affordable price point. While a gram of Gold is affordable, there are plentiful options available. Some of the gram Gold bullion available include APMEX-branded Gold bars and Gold bars produced by the Valcambi Mint. Gold has tremendous value and it provides a unique dimension to any investment portfolio.

What is the difference between an ounce and a troy ounce when looking at a price of Spot Gold chart?

The ounces Americans know in everyday life are actually called avoirdupois ounces. The Gold price per ounce is measured in troy ounces, which are equal to 1.09711 avoirdupois ounces. A pound of Gold is 12 troy ounces. This is also true of other Precious Metals, including Silver, Platinum and Palladium.

The Gram of Gold: What I should Know about Measurement

Many times, the price of Gold is listed in troy ounces. When you see the price of Gold per gram labeled, it is the equivalent to 31.1 grams per troy ounce, not the standard ounce. Grams are convenient units of pricing if you are starting off investing in Gold.

How many Grams are in an ounce of Gold?

One troy ounce equals 31.1035 grams or 480 grains. With these equivalences, you can easily determine the value of Gold. It is important to understand the weight and value of the Gold you are buying online. Do not confuse ounces with troy ounces as the price you see as associated with Precious Metals is troy ounces.

Why are Gold prices per ounce so high? What determines the price of Gold per ounce?

When determining what is the price of Gold, markets take into account the bedrock of capitalism: supply and demand. Relative to other metals like aluminum or iron, Gold is rarer to find, which means Gold prices today are higher than those easier-to-find metals. In contrast, about 150 years ago, aluminum prices were higher than Gold prices because it was so hard to extract aluminum from raw source materials. While it is rarer, Gold is also in high demand for jewelry, industrial uses, like the manufacture of medical devices, and electronics such as GPS units. These personal, commercial and economic uses all increase Gold prices per ounce.

How is the Gold spot price determined?

While Gold is traded as a commodity on many exchanges around the globe, the COMEX (Commodity Exchange, Inc.) is the most important exchange that sets the spot price of Gold. To calculate the spot Gold price, the data from the front month futures contract traded on the COMEX is used. Only when there is little to no volume on the front month contract, the next delivery month with the most volume is used to calculate the spot price of Gold.

Gold futures are a way to make a sale or purchase agreement at the current price, to be settled at a later date. Gold futures allow an investor to speculate as to whether the prices of Gold will rise or fall from a given day¡¯s price. Looking at historic Gold prices, or making Gold price predictions can help you with purchasing power.

Why are Silver and Gold prices so different?

Silver and Gold prices are so different in large part due to perception and demand. It is less about their rarity though there is some debate about whether Silver is now rarer than Gold. Either way, we see the 1 oz Gold price is about 70 times more than Silver prices. Part of the reason for the difference may be that Gold is harder to mine because Gold is often alloyed with other metals, requiring a purification process. The Gold price and Silver price also is reliant on demand, which has no signs of waning, especially for Gold bullion such as:

Gold is also used in a multitude of industrial products, including space-age equipment. In addition, Gold-Silver prices reflect that both central banks and individual investors buy more Gold. In many ways, the demand is all about perception, as well as history. Gold and Silver prices throughout time have been at odds. As early as 6,000 years ago, Gold was used as decoration and was introduced in ancient times as coins. Thus, we perceive Gold as valuable because civilizations before us also saw Gold's value. These are just some of the reasons Silver and Gold price is so different.

When do I invest in Gold coins and when do I invest in Gold bars?

Many people also like to collect both for a mix of coin and bar of Gold value.
