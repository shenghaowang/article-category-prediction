These are the last known images of two pilots who boarded a passenger jet in Malaysia more than a week ago, and then seemingly vanished into thin air.

The two men have come under increased scrutiny, after Malaysia¡¯s Prime Minister Najib Razak confirmed on the weekend that the Boeing 777¡¯s tracking systems were deliberately disabled by "someone on the plane".

Investigators have subsequently turned their attention to the crew and passengers on board the flight, including the political leanings and religious beliefs of its pilot and co-pilot, shown here being frisked as they passed through security at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, shortly before taking control of the doomed plane.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, was captured on airport cameras being frisked and collecting his hand luggage from an X-ray machine at airport security in Kuala Lumpur. Footage shows him being followed immediately by his 27-year-old co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, who also was frisked.
