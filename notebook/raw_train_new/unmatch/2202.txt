The nation¡¯s largest sporting goods retailer beat fourth-quarter profit expectations but missed on sales and provided a downbeat outlook for its current fiscal year.

Dick¡¯s Sporting Goods¡¯ net income rose to $116.0 million, or $1.11 a share, in the quarter ended Feb. 3, which included a $6 million charge related to the recent tax legislation, from $90.2 million, or 81 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $1.22, topping analysts¡¯ estimates.

Revenue rose 7.3% to $2.66 billion from $2.48 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.74 billion. Same-store sales fell 2.0%, a bigger drop than expected.

E-commerce sales increased approximately 9% on a 13-week to 13-week comparative basis as the retailer completed its first holiday season on its new Web platform. Online penetration for the fourth quarter was 19.0% of total net sales, up from 17.9% last year.

Dick¡¯s plans to open approximately 19 namesake stores, and relocate approximately four stores, in 2018. It doesn¡¯t expect to open any new Field & Stream or Golf Galaxy stores in 2018.

For 2018, the retailer expects same-store sale to be flat to down in the low single-digit percentage range. The Street had been looking for a 0.2% rise.

Dick¡¯s said it will no longer provide a quarterly outlook ¡°to more closely align with industry practices.¡±

¡°Looking ahead, we see considerable opportunity to deliver a stronger performance as we make improvements to our business,¡± said Lauren R. Hobart, president, Dick¡¯s Sporting Goods. ¡°Across the organization, we are focused on executional excellence and enhancing our omnichannel capabilities as we continue to transform to meet our customer¡¯s ever-changing needs. Our priorities include elevating the customer experience across our stores and our website, and leveraging the strength of our brand to deepen customer engagement and drive omnichannel traffic.¡±

For the full year, net income totaled $323.4 million, or $3.01 per share, up from $287.4 million, or $2.56 per diluted share in the previous year.

As of February 3, 2018, the company operated 716 Dick¡¯s Sporting Goods stores in 47 states, 94 Golf Galaxy stores in 32 states, and 35 Field & Stream stores in 16 states.
