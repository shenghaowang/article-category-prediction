The staff are friendly and passengers quickly get on and off the plane.

I travel this route (ATL - MGM) often and it seems like half the time I use Delta there is an issue with the plane including times when the flight has been cancelled. This time the plane left the gate and some fifteen minutes after sitting on the tarmac was taken back to the gate. The issue was said to be an element that keeps a sensor from freezing in extreme cold weather. The less than one hour flight took two hours to complete. This should have been dealt with as a maintenance issue but Delta doesn't seem to think so. The planes on this route make Delta a LOT of money as it is one of the most profitable routes in the US. You would think Delta could invest in keeping better maintained planes on the route.
