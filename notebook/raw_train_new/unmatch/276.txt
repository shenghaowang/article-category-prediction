J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, +4.70% shares slumped 22% in Thursday premarket trading after the department store retailer reported second-quarter losses that were wider than expected and sales fell. Net loss totaled $101 million, or 32 cents per share, after a loss of $48 million, or 15 cents per share, last year. Adjusted loss was 38 cents per share. Sales totaled $2.83 billion, down from $3.07 billion. The FactSet consensus was for a loss of 6 cents per share and sales of $2.81 billion. Same-store sales rose 0.3%, below the FactSet estimate for 1% growth. The company said it had to markdown items across many merchandise categories. "This quarter we adjusted our approach to inventory management from 'buying to store capacity' to 'buying and chasing' into demonstrated sales trends," said Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Davis in a release statement. "Inventory receipts continued to outpace total sales performance this quarter due to prior purchase commitments." J.C. Penney now expects same-store sales to be about flat, and adjusted losses are now expected to be $1 to 80 cents. The previous guidance was for same-store sales that were flat to up 2%, and a loss of 7 cents to EPS of 13 cents. The company says the search for a chief executive is ongoing. J.C. Penney shares have sunk 23.7% for the year to date compared with S&P 500 index SPX, -0.63% gains of 5.4% for the period.
