Will October US Jobs Report Add to Investors¡¯ Worries?

The Department of Labor is scheduled to release October data on US (VTI) employment on November 2. For the past few months, financial markets have been reacting sharply to the US jobs report numbers. Plus, the markets have been especially jittery lately due to interest rate hike fears, and the job numbers can give clues about the Fed¡¯s future monetary policy. Therefore, investors should understand the expectations for the report before the actual numbers come out. The October jobs report could be important data for the Fed to consider before its December policy meeting, where the committee is expected to raise rates (TLT) by another 25 basis points in addition to the three hikes it already made in 2018.
