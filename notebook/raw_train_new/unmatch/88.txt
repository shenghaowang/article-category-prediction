American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (NYSE:AEO) reported strong second-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday, but disappointing third-quarter guidance sent shares lower.

The Pittsburgh-based specialty apparel retailer posted earnings of 34 cents per share, a significant increase from 12 cents a year ago. Revenue grew 14% to $965 million, receiving a $40 million boost as a result of a shifted retail calendar.

American Eagle¡¯s same-store sales grew 9% due to an increase in demand from consumers gearing up to start a new school year. While overall same-store sales growth beat analyst estimates, comparable sales of its Aerie brand fell short of expectations for the first time in at least two years. The intimates and lingerie brand saw same-store sales growth of 27%, which was just shy of the 30% increase analysts were anticipating.
