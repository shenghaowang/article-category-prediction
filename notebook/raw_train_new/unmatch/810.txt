The supply of single-family home loan debt in early 2016 grew for the fourth consecutive quarter to hit $10.008 trillion, its highest level in three and a half years, according to Federal Reserve data.The first-quarter gain was a modest 0.2 percent from the end of last year, and a 1.5 percent increase from March 2015. But the servicing market is a slow-changing glacier, and steady increases over the past year are another indicator that the mortgage market has largely recovered from the housing recession.Most of the gain came from the agency market. A new Inside Mortgage Finance analysis shows that total single-family servicing for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae was up 0.5 percent during the first quarter, edging to a record $6.153 trillion. That continues the upward trend in agency servicing that took wing back in 2007 as the financial market crumbled.And Ginnie remained the fastest-growing of the agency programs, with single-family servicing up 1.3 percent in the first quarter. Ginnie?s share of the total mortgage servicing market edged up to 15.7 percent at the end of March, more than doubling its footprint in six years.
