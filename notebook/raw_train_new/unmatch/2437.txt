Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a ¡°buy¡± rating to a ¡°hold¡± rating in a research report issued on Wednesday.

According to Zacks, ¡°Shares of Urban Outfitters have increased and outpaced the industry in a year, driven by the company¡¯s positive surprise streak. We are upbeat on the company¡¯s second-quarter fiscal 2019 performance, wherein both the top and bottom lines grew year over year. Notably, comparable retail segment net sales increased for the fourth quarter in row, while all the three brands registered comps growth. Management expects third quarter sales comps to grow high-single digit. We believe new store openings, increased digital penetration, merchandising improvements and international expansion bode well. Management is also making efforts to enhance the performance of brands through store refurbishment and by bringing in more compelling assortments. However, management expects SG&A expenses to increase in the third quarter due to higher digital marketing investments, incentive-based compensation and increased store payroll.¡±
