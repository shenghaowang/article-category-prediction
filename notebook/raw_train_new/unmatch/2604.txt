NEW YORK (Reuters) - An early gain on Wall Street fizzled and sent global stocks lower on Monday as investors remained cautious despite IBM's $34 billion deal to purchase Red Hat Inc and Standard & Poor's decision to keep Italy's credit rating unchanged.

In late afternoon trading, The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 319.63 points, or 1.29 percent, to 24,368.68, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 26.06 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,632.63 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 145.70 points, or 2.03 percent, to 7,021.52.7,021.52.

The Dow had shot up more than 300 points shortly after the opening of trade.

Shares in Europe rose broadly following Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign rating unchanged, prompting relief there was no ratings downgrade.
