The OLCC, in coordination with the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Agriculture, will review the initial submission of research certificate proposals. The proposal provides an organization the opportunity to pose a cannabis research question, as well as detail the research process and testing protocol, and outline the research budget.

Additional information will be posted on the OLCC Recreational Marijuana website about the research proposal submission and review process. Research certificate proposals will need to be submitted using the OLCC Recreational Marijuana online application.

Please be aware that some information submitted is a public record and subject to Oregon¡¯s Public Record Laws. The OLCC recommends reading the Federal Code on Protection of Human Research Subjects (45 CFR Part 46) prior to preparing and submitting any proposal.

Although an OLCC licensee will be able to donate cannabis for use with this certificate, the research certificate does not allow its holder to sell cannabis. All cannabis certified and managed under the research certificate will be required to use OLCC¡¯s Cannabis Tracking System. Please read OLCC¡¯s Temporary Rules for additional information on the certificate requirements. Oregon HB3400 which was the basis for creating the certificate also provides information on the intent of the certificate program.
