DETROIT ¡ª After issuing 60 recalls and accumulating $3.8 billion in costs for vehicle repairs and compensation for accident victims, General Motors is desperately trying to move past the worst safety crisis in its history.

The automaker said on Thursday that its second-quarter earnings fell about 85 percent, mostly because of the financial fallout from its long-delayed recall of defective small cars that started in February.

The drastic drop was caused, in part, by a $400 million charge taken to compensate those affected by faulty ignitions that can cut engine power and disable air bags. It was the first time G.M. had put a dollar amount on the expected cost of the victims fund, though it said that amount could grow.

G.M. also took an $874 million charge to cover future recall costs. The two charges come on top of the $2.5 billion the company has already spent on recalls this year.
