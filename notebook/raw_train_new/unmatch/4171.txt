American Eagle Outfitters reported a first-quarter profit that narrowly missed Wall Street estimates as a tough retail climate pushed the teen apparel retailer to offer deep discounts and bear excess shipping costs on online orders.

Shares of the company fell nearly 6.3% to $12.15 before the bell on Wednesday.

The company¡¯s gross margins in the first quarter ended April 29 declined by 2.7% to 36.5%, while its inventory increased 9% to $364 million.

Net income fell to $25.24 million, or 14 cents per share, in the quarter, from $40.48 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company said it incurred $5.4 million pre-tax restructuring charges for severance and related charges in the quarter.

Excluding certain items, the company earned 16 cents per share in the quarter, missing analysts¡¯ average estimate of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also said it expected its current-quarter comparable sales to be in the range of flat to down in low single digit percentage.

American Eagle (aeo), however, reported a surprise 2% rise in quarterly comparable-store sales as strong demand for its Aerie line of lingerie lifted the company¡¯s sales amid a tough retail climate.
