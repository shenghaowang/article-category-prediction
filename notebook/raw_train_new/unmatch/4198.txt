Rising bond yields and a sell-off in healthcare shares sent the US stock market sliding on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 352-point tumble its steepest in eight months. Shares of healthcare-related companies sank after Amazon.com Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said they plan to form a venture aimed at lowering healthcare costs for their US employees. This lead to stocks on Wall Street falling by around one per cent. The S&P health sector tumbled 1.8 percent, the most among the 11 major sectors. Health insurer UnitedHealth's 3.2 percent drop was the most on the Dow, while Express Scripts' 6.2 percent decline weighed the most on the Nasdaq and S&P. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR said: ¡°We've had a unilateral move higher [in stocks] to start things off and people are realising this is not sustainable. You're also seeing some cracks in the global story with interest rates rising."

At 12:33 pm ET (1733 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 333.27 points, or 1.26 percent, at 26,106.21. The index fell as much as 352 points, its steepest intraday point drop since May 17. The S&P 500 was down 27.82 points, or 0.97 per cent, at 2,825.71 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 60.17 points, or 0.81 per cent, at 7,406.33. According to Bespoke Investment Group the S&P 500 could end its record streak without consecutive declines of 0.5 per cent. Stocks fell lower due to a decline in energy shares amid ongoing evidence of rising US crude output.

Investors were phased by the two day decline on Wall Street, as Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York said this pushed people in to the arms of the safety of US government bonds. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge for investors' "fears", rose to as much as 15.42, its highest level since August. Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, said: "I think despite this selloff, all indications point to a firming economy and I do expect to see some bargain hunters step in soon." The Fed started its two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) market expectations a rate hike of 5.2 per cent will be implemented.

The meeting will be watched for comments that could raise the likelihood of rates being hiked four times this year, instead of three, especially as inflation readings have firmed in recent readings. Mr Pavlik said: "Investors are getting a bit worried about inflation which has led some people to believe that the Fed might be more aggressive when it comes to raising rates." The dollar reversed Monday's gains. After six straight weekly declines, the dollar index was on track to fall about 3.4 percent for the month, which would be its biggest monthly fall since March 2016. The dollar index fell 0.15 per cent, with the euro up 0.16 per cent to $1.2401. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.17 per cent versus the greenback at 108.79 per dollar. US President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address later on Tuesday will be monitored for his comments on a $1.7 trillion infrastructure spending plan and on trade.
