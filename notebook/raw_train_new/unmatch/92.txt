The fatality was particularly shocking because it comes as Metro-North is under increased federal scrutiny after accidents that left four passengers and a railroad foreman dead. The FRA has had staffers on the railroad poring over safety practices and procedures for nearly two months. Metro-North has conducted refresher training for thousands of workers and has installed new equipment to ensure engineers don't exceed speed limits on curves.
