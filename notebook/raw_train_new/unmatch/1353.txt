FRANKFURT--German inflation eased in April due to a slowdown in inflation in the service sector and despite rising inflation for food and energy, the country's statistics body said Monday.

The annual inflation rate--measured by harmonized European Union standards--fell to 1.4% from 1.5% in March, the Federal Statistical Office said in a preliminary release. The outcome is in line with economists' forecasts.

As a consequence, German inflation fell further below the European Central Bank's target, with the ECB aiming to keep inflation in the eurozone at just below 2%.

Many economists expect a mild pickup in Germany's inflation rate during the course of the year, underpinned by rising wages and household consumption.

A group of leading economic think tanks in Germany forecast that the country's harmonized inflation rate should come in at 1.7% this year, unchanged from 2017, before rising to 1.9% in 2019.
