Notably, the National Association of Realtors revealed that in July, pending home sales fell on an annual basis for seven consecutive months, indicating that prospective borrowers and homeowners aren't in a rush to buy a home.

¡°The reason sales are falling off last year¡¯s pace is that multiple years of inadequate supply in markets with strong job growth have finally driven up home prices to a point where an increasing number of prospective buyers are unable to afford it,¡± NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said.
