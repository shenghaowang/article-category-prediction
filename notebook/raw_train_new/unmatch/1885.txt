Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, said traders may have overreacted initially to yesterday¡¯s Iraq airstrike news, with the action exacerbated by light summertime trading.

He noted the S&P 500 stayed above 1,900 on Thursday, and it¡¯s managed to hold around the lower end of its trading range for the week.

¡°There is an appetite for stocks around this level,¡± Cardillo told MarketWatch in a phone interview earlier this morning.

Those airstrikes have actually just taken place, but that hasn¡¯t hit stock futures much. A productivity report also beat expectations, but the market reaction was relatively muted.
