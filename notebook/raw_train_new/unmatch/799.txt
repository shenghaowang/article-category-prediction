¡°I am never confident of any forecast,¡± said Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee.

He said economic models can never be perfectly accurate regardless of how much data and analysis the economists put into the prediction. Mr Vlieghe added that forecasts look at probabilities of certain outcomes rather than predicting a definite picture of future growth, and cautioned against "unrealistic expectations" of perfect predictions.

¡°It is still going to be the case that there are large forecast errors, we are probably not going to forecast the next financial crisis, nor are we going to forecast the next recession - models are just not that good," he told the Treasury Select Committee.

Governor Mark Carney said that the Bank had suspected the business and consumer surveys after the EU referendum were overly gloomy, but should have been bolder in adapting its own forecasts to reflect that.

¡°We didn¡¯t think the economy would go into recession¡­ we were towards the top end of forecasters at the time. We should have been higher, in retrospect,¡± said the Governor.

¡°We might understand that no forecast is perfect, but that is not what [the public] hears - we need to do a better job of explaining what a forecast is and what the different scenarios are for the economy.¡±
