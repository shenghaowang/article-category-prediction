The main price driver in Asia on Monday was the looming start of U.S. sanctions against Iran's oil exports, which will start on November 4.

While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in June to boost supply to make up for expected Iran disruptions, an internal document reviewed by Reuters suggested that OPEC is struggling to add barrels to the market as an increase in Saudi Arabian supply was offset by declines in Iran, Venezuela and Angola.

Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said on Monday that other producers may struggle to fully make up for the expected fall in Iranian supply, and that coupled with strong demand, oil prices could rise further.

Traders said major oil consumers were stockpiling in anticipation of more disruptions.

"In China, higher seasonal demand and suspected stockpiling are occurring, while similarly the U.S. and the OECD continue building stockpiles ahead of potential supply disruptions this winter," said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

Despite this, Innes said overall global oil supply was currently enough to meet demand.

There were also some signs of rising output, especially in North America.
