What a month it was for the stock market. In today's short-term focused society some will focus on the rebound over the last few days in the major domestic stock market indices, but even those gains cannot hide the fact that October was one of the most challenging months for stocks in recent memory. All told, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.1% in October, making it the best performer of the major market indices! By comparison, the S&P 500 dropped 6.9% led by declines in eight of its 10 subgroups.
