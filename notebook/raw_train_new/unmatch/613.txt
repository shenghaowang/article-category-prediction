WALL STREET: Technology companies skidded and misses in corporate earnings pulled most U.S. indexes lower for the seventh time in eight days. The S&P 500 index dropped 0.6 percent to 2,750.79.

CHINESE INFLATION: The National Bureau of Statistics said China's consumer price index gained 2.5 percent in September from a year earlier, supported largely by fresh food prices and in line with market expectations.
