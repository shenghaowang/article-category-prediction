The Royal Mint's early proposals said "heavy coins 'burn' holes in the ordinary users' pocket, inconvenience those, such as milkmen, who carry around large quantities and add extra transport and security costs for bulk handlers like banks and supermarkets".

But on the other hand, it opined, "coins should command respect". Furthermore, they should "be easily distinguishable, both visually and by touch. This is important in the dark and for blind or handicapped people."

In the end the Mint opted for a coin of similar size to the 20p piece, but far thicker and heavier, and with the familiar yellow colour of the nickel brass mix. This is an alloy of copper (70pc), nickel (5.5pc and zinc (24.5pc).

"Two new coins of the same diameter might well be considered confusing but it is, in fact, entirely practical as long as other features are different." The Royal Mint said.

"In particular the 1 coin will be perceptibly thicker. This will make it easier to identify in the dark, while meeting the requirement that a prime unit of currency is elegant and prestigious."
