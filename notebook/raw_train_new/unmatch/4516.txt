MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) ¡ª The state says Alabama¡¯s unemployment rate has matched its all-time low.

The governor¡¯s office says the preliminary, seasonally adjusted jobless rate for September is 3.8 percent. That matches the state¡¯s lowest recorded unemployment rate set in April 2007.

It also means Alabama¡¯s jobless rate is below the national unemployment rate, which was 4.2 percent last month. That was a 16-year low nationally.

Alabama Labor Secretary Fitzgerald Washington says employers continue to add positions and are beating job-growth projections.

The Alabama numbers represent 82,678 unemployed people in the state in September, down from almost 91,000 in August and 131,000 unemployed people a year ago.

Shelby County in metro Birmingham has the state¡¯s lowest jobless rate at 2.4 percent. Wilcox County in rural western Alabama is highest at 8.9 percent.
