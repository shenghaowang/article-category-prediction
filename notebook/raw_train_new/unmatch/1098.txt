So why are all these mortgage companies consolidating, laying off employees, sending out scary warnings, and going out of business?

Well, a recent statistic revealed that 2.33% of all US mortgages are currently delinquent, a number which is sure to rise over the next several years. And mortgage repurchase requests have tripled between the first and second quarter of 2006 alone thanks to shoddy underwriting.

Not to mention declining home values in almost every metropolitan area throughout the United States, sky-high home prices at time of origination, rising mortgage rates, rampant fraud, a deteriorating secondary market, and unmanageable mortgage payments.

I recently began adding mortgage lenders from parts of the world other than the United States, as well as companies that remain open but have been affected seriously by the mortgage crisis in one way or another.

According to a recent report, there were some 86,126 mortgage job cuts in 2007, with another 30,000 to 40,000 expected by early 2008.

Even though it has been roughly a decade since the downturn began, mortgage companies are still facing the consequences of getting involved in what was then a very risky housing market. Amazingly, we continue to see layoffs and closures driven by what transpired many years ago.

Given how bad things got, this isn＊t too surprising.
