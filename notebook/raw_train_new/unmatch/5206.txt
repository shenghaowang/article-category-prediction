As the possibility of John Taylor becoming the next chairman of the Federal Reserve seems to grow in probability, helped by a new report showing Vice President Mike Pence is a fan, there also seems to be more talk in the market wondering if the Stanford professor really is as much of a hawk as he sounds.

The idea is that the so-called Taylor Rule ¡ª named after the very same candidate to run the Fed ¡ª has many variables to determine interest rates. Alter them, and a policy path determined by a mathematical formula might not be so hawkish after all.

Taylor himself mused that the natural rate of interest, or R-star as it¡¯s called, may be falling.

Speaking of authors including San Francisco Fed President John Williams, Taylor told a Boston Fed conference just this month: ¡°They find it does, and it¡¯s very close to the chart that you showed us a few minutes ago. And so that has to be taken into account, and the rules are changing for that reason.¡±

Taken into account or not, Taylor last year wrote on the topic of ¡°finding the equilibrium real interest rate in a fog of policy deviations.¡±

The too-long, didn¡¯t-read version of his paper: the results are still inconclusive to incorporate into policy rules, and more over, there¡¯s evidence that contradicts the idea there has been a significant decline in the equilibrium real interest rate.

Put it all together ¡ª as Omair Sharif, an economist at Soci¨¦t¨¦ G¨¦n¨¦rale does ¡ª and the conclusion is Taylor is very much the hawk that he¡¯s made out to be.

¡°Needless to say, Taylor does not seem to be a big believer in the idea of a lower neutral real rate, and thus would likely favor higher rates despite the fact that the implied median neutral real rate in the Fed¡¯s Summary of Economic Projections is currently about 75 basis points,¡± Sharif wrote.
