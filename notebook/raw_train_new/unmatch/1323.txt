Mortgage rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose this week, with the current rate borrowers were quoted on Zillow at 4.08 percent, up from 4.03 percent at this same time last week.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate hovered around 4.10 percent for the majority of the week, peaking at 4.17 percent on Thursday before easing back down to the current rate today.

¡°Mortgage rates were subdued last week as ongoing geopolitical concerns and economic softness in Europe encouraged investors to buy U.S. mortgage-backed securities as a safe haven,¡± said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. ¡°This week, we expect international headlines, rather than U.S. economic data, to drive any meaningful changes to mortgage rates.¡±

Additionally, the 15-year fixed mortgage rate this morning was 3.12 percent, and for 5/1 ARMs, the rate was 2.77 percent.
