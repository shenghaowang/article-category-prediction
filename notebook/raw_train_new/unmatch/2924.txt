Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage coverage of the Eurozone financial crisis, and other interesting developments across the global economy.

And for once, we can start with some encouraging economic news -- European car sales have risen, breaking a downward trend that dates back to the end of September 2011.

Purchases of new cars across the European Union in April were 1.7% higher than a year ago, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) released this morning showed.

Rising demand from Germany (+3.8%), the UK (+14.8%) and -- perhaps most surprisingly -- Spain (+10.8%) led the way.

These graphs, comparing monthly sales to the previous year, shows how the long downturn has finally been broken.

We need to be cautious about hanging out the bunting, though. There are three reasons to be cautious:
 There were another two working days in April 2013 - more opportunity to nip down to the showroom or haggle a credit agreement with the bank
 Demand for new cars continued sliding in two key economies at the heart of the crisis - France (-5.3%) and Italy (-10.8%).
 This small rally in April doesn't wipe away the disappointment of January, February and March. New car registrations over the first four months of the year are 7.1% lower than in 2012.

And as ACEA put it:

Still, it's nice to start the blog with some upbeat data, especially from a sector that's been badly dented by Europe's economic troubles.

Coming up today, the main political developments could some in Italy, where Enrico Letta's cabinet is meeting to discuss measures to revive its economy.

On the economics front, we have fresh eurozone construction data at 10am BST.

And in finance, the European Central Bank will release an update on how much money has been repaid by banks who borrowed from its huge liquidity injections (the LTRO programme).

I'll be tracking all the latest developments as usual.
