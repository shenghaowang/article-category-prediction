General Motors has issued a recall to address an ignition switch issue in certain 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5 models, which affects 619,122 vehicles. In some situations, the ignition switch can turn off the engine while driving.

The Problem: If there's too much weight on a key ring or the car is jarred on a rough patch of road, the ignition switch can be moved from the "run" position, turning the engine off. This could cause a crash if the car is still in motion, and in that event the airbags may not deploy because the car is off.

The Fix: GM will notify owners, and dealers will replace the ignition switch free of charge. The automaker hasn't provided a timeline for when notifications will commence, but owners of affected vehicles can call Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020 or Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 using the reference number 13454.

Number of Vehicles Potentially Affected: The recall covers 619,122 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5 models.
