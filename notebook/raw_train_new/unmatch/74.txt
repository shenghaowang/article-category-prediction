Central bankers still believe in the Phillips curve even though the relationship seems to have broken down during a recovery that is less than a year away from being the longest on record.

Powell said the model isn't dead, but instead is part of a change in circumstances that has taken place during an unprecedented time for the Fed.

"What is more likely, in my view, is that many factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced, but not eliminated, the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation," he said.

The Fed kept its benchmark interest rate anchored near zero for seven years while engaging in a bond-purchasing program that ballooned its balance sheet to more than $4.5 trillion. Along with that, the central bank used guidance to help manage inflation expectations, letting the market know that while the FOMC would be content to let inflation hold somewhat above or below its 2 percent target for a period of time, it would remain vigilant at making sure it didn't move too far in either direction.

"When monetary policy tends to offset shocks to inflation, rather than amplifying and extending them, and when people come to expect this policy response, a surprise rise or fall in labor market tightness will naturally have smaller and less persistent effects on inflation," Powell said.

The unemployment rate currently stands at 3.9 percent, near a 50-year low, and core inflation is right around 2 percent. Powell said the two numbers are part of a "very good" economy that boasts "a remarkably positive outlook" from forecasters.
