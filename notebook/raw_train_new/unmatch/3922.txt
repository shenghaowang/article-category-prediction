It is understood that Vodafone has tabled an offer for the private-equity owned Madrid-based group, which sells fixed and mobile phone, TV and internet services and that the offer will be discussed at an Ono board meeting today. Both Vodafone, whose shares remained unchanged at 222p, and Ono, which is also believed to be weighing up a float, did not comment.

Vodafone, which may face competition from US cable operator Liberty Global, has the cash to make the move after its shareholders recently approved its 78billion stake sale in US mobile phone operator Verizon Wireless.

It would also boost its flagging European operations, including the UK, where revenues have been hit by tough pay-as-you-go and business markets, and continue its move into bundled services, to include broadband, TV and phone.

Last year it paid 6.5billion for German cable operator Kabel Deutschland and is believed to be looking at Italian broadband firm Fastweb and a broadband deal with BSkyB.
