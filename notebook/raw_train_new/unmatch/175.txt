SMARTPHONE suppliers were among the worst-performing semiconductor stocks on Tuesday after two disappointing earnings reports from peers in Asia alarmed investors.

Apple Inc suppliers Broadcom Inc, Cirrus Logic Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc fell more than one per cent. They were among the worst performers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which was little changed in afternoon trading.

Sunny Optical Technology Group, based in Yuyao, China, lost nearly a quarter of its market value on Tuesday after earnings missed estimates.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has fallen more than 3 per cent since Aug 8 and is about 6 per cent shy of a March record.

Even with that, the group of 30 chipmakers and equipment suppliers has gained more than 8 per cent this year after rising 38 per cent in 2017 and 36 per cent in 2016.

US chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and equipment supplier Applied Materials Inc will be scrutinised when they report earnings on Thursday.
