Oracle stock fell late Monday as the database software giant reported quarterly earnings after the market close that missed revenue estimates but beat on the bottom line.

Oracle (ORCL) reported revenue of $9.19 billion, missing analyst views of $9.28 billion, for its fiscal first quarter. That compares with revenue of $9.18 billion for the year-ago period.

Oracle has now missed revenue estimates in seven of the past 13 quarters.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 71 cents per share, beating predictions of 69 cents and up 14.5%.

Oracle shares tumbled 4.2%, near 47.14, during after-hours trading on the stock market today. It's the fifth quarter in a row that Oracle stock has fallen since reporting quarterly results.

Oracle is undergoing a shift in its product portfolio. It's moving away from a traditional model of licensing and maintenance to a subscription-based cloud-computing business. Meanwhile, it's trying to sustain profit margins that have been under pressure.

Oracle's competitors include Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), in addition to large technology giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), which are trying to take away its customers.

Salesforce.com reported quarterly results last month that beat estimates but gave an earnings outlook that fell short. Salesforce.com stock was flat in after-hours trading. Workday stock was up 1.2%, near 146.43. Microsoft was down fractionally after hours. Amazon rose marginally.

Oracle reported cloud services and license support revenue of $6.6 billion, up 3% from the year-ago period and accounting for 72% of total revenue.

Total cloud services and license support, plus cloud license and on-premise license revenue, were up 2% to $7.5 billion
