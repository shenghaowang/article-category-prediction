¡ª Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group said Sunday that it will go public on a U.S. stock exchange in a move analysts say might raise up to $15 billion in the year¡¯s biggest initial public offering.

The announcement confirming plans for a U.S. offering ended months of speculation over where the company would list its shares after talks for a Hong Kong stock sale fell apart last year.

Alibaba is one of the world¡¯s biggest Internet companies and says that more than $150 billion worth of merchandise changes hands on its online platforms each year, more than Amazon.com and eBay combined.

The company began as a service to link Chinese suppliers with retailers abroad and has expanded into retail e-commerce. It is little-known abroad but has launched two consumer-oriented services in the United States.

¡°Alibaba Group has decided to commence the process of an initial public offering in the United States,¡± the company said in a statement. ¡°This will make us a more global company and enhance the company¡¯s transparency, as well as allow the company to continue to pursue our long-term vision and ideals.¡±

It gave no details about the timing or size of the IPO, or on which exchange it would take place.

Analysts have estimated that an Alibaba IPO could raise up to $15 billion and value the company at more than $100 billion.

Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba had previously abandoned plans for an IPO in Hong Kong because the semiautonomous Chinese financial center¡¯s stock exchange refused to change its rules to accommodate the company¡¯s unusual management structure.
