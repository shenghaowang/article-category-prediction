European stocks fell Tuesday, declining alongside U.S. stocks as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell¡¯s upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy underscored concerns that the central bank will ramp up its pace of raising borrowing rates.

Also in focus Tuesday was the unfolding battle to control British broadcaster Sky PLC, which has landed a roughly $31 billion buyout bid from Comcast Corp.

European stocks wilted early in the session as investors moved with caution before Powell¡¯s appearance before the House Financial Services panel. In afternoon trade, stocks moved lower as U.S. Treasury yields shot higher and the widely watched ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.21% hit its highest in more than five weeks after Powell during his testimony said the world¡¯s largest economy has strengthened since December.

Equity markets have been swayed by concerns that the Fed may raise interest rates four times this year instead of the three times that had been widely anticipated. Such concerns have pushed U.S. bond yields higher, as prices fall, and the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% is rising toward the 3% mark. Higher U.S. interest rates tend to drive financial markets globally in part as many companies conduct business in the U.S.

Powell¡¯s testimony was his first to U.S. Congress after taking over as the central bank¡¯s boss. On Thursday, he will testify Thursday before a Senate committee.

What strategists are saying
 ¡°Whilst the reaction was that of a market which is expecting a mildly more hawkish Fed Chair, the reaction was also fairly tame in comparison to what we have seen earlier in the month,¡± said City Index senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta, in a note.

¡°This tame reaction suggests that market fears have subsided quite substantially from earlier in the month. Fundamentals remain strong, Powell has put in a solid, optimistic but not overly hawkish first appearance and there appears little reason to fear gradual rate hikes going forward,¡± she added.

A preliminary reading of inflation in Spain in February came in at 1.1% from the INE statistics agency. That¡¯s above the 0.8% FactSet consensus estimate and higher than January¡¯s reading of 0.6%.
