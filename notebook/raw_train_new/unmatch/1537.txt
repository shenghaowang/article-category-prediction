Shares of Urban Outfitters (URBN) have been hard to derail in 2018, but it happened on Thursday.

The Barron¡¯s Next 50 company¡¯s shares fell more than 8% as of afternoon trading following the morning announcement¡ªmade ahead of a conference appearance by the CFO¡ªthat Q3 comparable sales through Sept. 3 were up 10%. (The company¡¯s quarter ends in October.)

That¡¯s not a dismal number, and Urban Outfitters didn¡¯t update earnings guidance as a result. The company, meanwhile, is one of many enjoying a retail-friendly economic environment. But it may be that investors, seeing the shares up some 24% in 2018, decided that the price was too perfect with the company still in turnaround mode.

¡°Comps¡± were up 13.7% in Q2, with all of the retailer¡¯s brands up 11% or more, and 10% in Q1. (In last year¡¯s Q3, they were up just 1%.) On Thursday, at a Goldman Sachs event (a transcript of which was available on FactSet) CFO Frank Conforti said the core Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie brands were ¡°slightly below¡± double digits and the company was heading toward 7% or 8% for the quarter.

¡°If we land in that range for the end of the quarter,¡± Conforti said, ¡°we don¡¯t see that as a deceleration at all in our business.¡± On the call, he suggested that the economic environment should make for a holiday season that doesn¡¯t require margin-busting discounting to get people into stores.

If that¡¯s the case, today¡¯s dip may have represented an opportunity to get in at a good time. FactSet¡¯s mean target is 16% above current levels. But the sharpness of today¡¯s move suggests that there¡¯s still some skepticism out there.
