Even as federal officials catch heat for not disclosing how many Obamacare enrollees nationwide have actually paid their first insurance premiums, nine states and the District of Columbia have been releasing such data publicly.

Those states are seeing a wide range of outcomes in the rate of people who sign up for insurance plans on their government-run exchanges and make their first month's payments. That payment is required for people to actually be enrolled and eligible for health benefits under the plans.

Connecticut, whose Obamacare marketplace has been seen as a star of the state-run exchanges, leads the pack in paid enrollments. In the Nutmeg State, 92 percent of its 57,465 Obamacare sign-ups have coughed up the cash to make their enrollment official.

"It's never going to be 100 percent," said Kevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health CT, the state's marketplace. But, he added, "we're working very aggressively through health plans to get the other 8 percent in."

Minnesota is in second place, with 90 percent of enrollees paid.

California, whose 923,832 sign-ups make it the leader by far in nationwide Obamacare enrollment, is in third place, with 85 percent reported paid enrollment.

Maryland is dead last. The state's exchange, which has been a technological disaster, saw just 54 percent of enrollees paying for their first premiums as of March 1. 



The exchanges operated by Washington state and Vermont also failed to crack 60 percent.

Five states that run their own Obamacare exchanges are not releasing the paid rate for the Obamacare exchanges they operate. And Massachusetts only reports paid enrollments; it does not report totals of people who have signed up for plans, meaning that the paid rate is unknown.



Insurance experts estimate that nationwide, anywhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of Obamacare enrollees haven't paid.
