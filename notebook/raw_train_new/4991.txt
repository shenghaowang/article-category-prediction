The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data Monday on the unemployment rates in the 50 states and District of Columbia. The numbers changed very little in January, the period for the current report. Forty-three states and the District of Columbia had unemployment rate decreases from December, one state had an increase and six states had no change at all. Every one of the 50 states and the District of Columbia had unemployment rate decreases from January 2013. For perspective, the national jobless rate for the January was 6.6%.

The BLS points out that some of these numbers may not be statistically significant if viewed by month.
