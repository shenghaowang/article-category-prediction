ISTANBUL, Turkey (Reuters) - Twitter must get a legal representative in Turkey and agree to block individual accounts if it is to resolve a row that has led the government to block access to the service, Industry Minister Fikri Isik said on Friday.

Courts blocked Twitter overnight after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan¡¯s defiant vow to ¡°wipe out¡± the social media service, which has been awash with allegations in a corruption scandal shaking his government ahead of elections.
