(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc shares (JCP.N) rose as much as 10 percent after Citigroup upgraded its rating to ¡°buy¡± from ¡°neutral,¡± saying the department store¡¯s sales will continue to grow and dismissing concerns about its liquidity.

Citi raised its price target on Penney¡¯s shares to $11. It also said Penney, which last year had to raise money three times in debt and equity markets, has ¡°sufficient liquidity.¡±

Penney shares were up 8.5 percent to $9.13 in morning trading, reaching their highest level since December. They fell as low as $4.90 five weeks ago.

Penney¡¯s stock has been on a tear since the retailer two weeks ago gave an upbeat forecast for fiscal 2015, saying comparable sales would rise as much as 5 percent. The retailer also said at that time that the hardest part of its turnaround was behind it.

¡°JCP can continue to deliver positive comp store sales,¡± Citi analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a research note, pointing to an overhaul to the retailer¡¯s home goods section. Comparable store sales are sales at stores open at least a year.

Penney sales plummeted in 2012 and most of 2013 following an attempt to go upmarket with trendier wares.
