Columbia, SC (WLTX) -- South Carolina's Department of Employment Workforce reports January's state-wide unemployment rate is slightly lower from December to January.

DEW says January's unemployment rate of 6.4% was down 0.2% from December's rate of 6.6%, the second month in a row since 2001 the state's unemployment rate was below the national rate.

The seasonally adjusted number of unemployed is estimated to be 138,268, with the number of employed persons at 2,030,996, an annual uptick compared to January of 2013 by 22,127.

Seasonal adjustments remove the effects that follow a regular pattern annually, such as tourism-related and schools closing for the summer. By removing these regularly anticipated numbers, it enables DEW auditors to more easily observe the over-all movements in employment data.

Job gains of approximately 1,100 were reported in Professional and Business Services, Education and Health Services showed addition of 400, and Information-based positions were up by 100.

Job decreases were seen in the Construction Industry of approximately 1,700, Financial Sector jobs were down 1,200, Trade, Transportation, and Utilities jobs declined 1,000, Government jobs went down 1,000, Leisure & Hospitality positions declined 500, and "other services" positions declined 400.

The non-seasonally-adjusted employment count shows a decrease of jobs by 35,200 month-to-month, typical for the December-to-January post-holiday season layoffs, in addition to school closings during the holiday season.

Non-farm payroll data shows South Carolina's first month-over-month drop in that rate since June of 2013, down 4,800 from December to January, at 1,916,700 persons employed. Since January of last year not-seasonally adjusted non-farm jobs were up 46,000 overall in South Carolina.
