LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) ¡ª City Attorney Mike Feuer Friday announced a $10 million lawsuit against Time Warner Cable, alleging the media company refused to pay fees.

The suit claims that at the same time Time Warner was withholding payments to the City, it was raking in billions of dollars in revenue.

¡°The City of Los Angeles enabled Time Warner to make billions and in turn they shortchanged the taxpayers millions,¡± said Feuer. ¡°This is the day where we stand up and say enough is enough.¡±

The City is demanding that Time Warner pay $9,697,896 in owed franchise and PEG fees from 2008 through 2011.

¡°As a major job creator, tax contributor and service provider in the City of Los Angeles, Time Warner Cable is an active and responsible corporate citizen in the City of Los Angeles. We are disappointed the City has chosen to bring this action, which we strongly believe is without merit. It will now be resolved through the legal process.¡±
