American Airlines and JetBlue are ending their interline agreements covering routes from Boston and New York.

American said that because of its merger with US Airways, its East Coast network provides ¡°better connectivity,¡± so it no longer needs the supplemental coverage it got from JetBlue.Beginning March 10, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier.Effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline.All AAdvantage miles or TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers' accounts and are not affected.
