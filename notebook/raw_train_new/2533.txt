(AP) -- U.S. stock indexes are mixed in afternoon trading Thursday, hovering near their latest record highs. Gains by technology and other sector stocks were offset by losses among industrials and energy companies. Investors had their eye on the latest company earnings news, while also monitoring developments in Washington ahead of a possible federal government shutdown this weekend.

KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 1 point to 2,803 as of 2:52 p.m. Eastern Time. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 26,058. The Nasdaq added 10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,308. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,582. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs on Wednesday. Two stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.

THE QUOTE: The market's dip from its latest highs represents "just a little setback," said Craig Callahan, chief investment officer at ICON Advisers. "We're still bullish and expect the market to move higher over the next year."

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LOOMS: Republicans and Democrats were scrambling Thursday to avert a possible federal government shutdown before a midnight Friday deadline. Republicans were trying to pass a funding bill that would prevent the shutdown of federal agencies, but Democrats threatened to vote against the bill unless the White House and GOP lawmakers include protections for younger immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

Should the shutdown happen, it could have a negative impact on consumer spending and financial conditions, though it's unlikely that it would cause lasting or broad damage to the economy, Credit Suisse economists concluded in a note published Thursday.

As for the market impact, a shutdown could sap some of the momentum Wall Street has been riding, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
