DigitalGlobe Crowdsourcing Tech Used in Search for Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane

DigitalGlobe (NYSE: DGI) has launched a program with its Tomnod crowdsourcing platform to help in the search of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 jetliner that went missing on Saturday.

The FirstLook subscription service works to compate pre- and post-event satellite imagery for emergency management functions, the company said Monday.

Two DigitalGlobe satellites have collected images of the search area, which includes the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea.

Volunteer Tomnod users then analyze the images for clues to the possible location of the missing aircraft.

Acquired by DigitalGlobe in 2013, Tomnod has previously helped response and recovery activities in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters such as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
