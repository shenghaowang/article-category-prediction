Of course some rules and regulations are necessary in a free market economy. Fraud is illegal. Pollutants are regulated. The question is how more rules and regulations imposed by the government improve the efficiency and effectiveness of industry and lower costs for consumers. The 2007 housing market collapse and recession were seeded by government intervention in the mortgage industry. The Community Reinvestment Act encouraged banks to make risky loans while assuring the backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They then lowered interest rates amping up the market. Yes Wall Street took advantage of the situation but they did not cause it. Corporations make good business decisions by leaving off-shore profits, off-shore. The U.S corporate tax is 35%, the highest in the industrialized world. If repatriated, stockholders effectively pay these taxes. They are again taxed if distributed as dividends. Businesses also make good decisions by seeking low cost sites. It benefits the consumer and lets manufacturers compete in the global market. These are prudent business decisions not a lack of integrity. Finally, its understood that premiums are mostly determined by claims experience. However, mandatory coverages dictated by government do impact costs. Costs will also increase, directly and indirectly, due to more than 20 new and increased taxes imbedded in Obamacare.
