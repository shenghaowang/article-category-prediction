TOKYO (AP) ¡ª Toyota has shut down production at its two auto-assembly plants in India and locked out 6,400 workers amid testy wage negotiations.

Toyota Motor Corp. spokesman Naoki Sumino said some workers were disrupting production. There have been no injuries or damage at the plants.

The lockout came Monday following negotiations that began in April last year, and arbitration talks that failed earlier this year.

The two plants in Bangalore produce 310,000 vehicles a year, including the Innova van, Fortuner sport-utility vehicle, Corolla subcompact and Etios models.

Toyota has been eager to expand in India with sales of its affordable models.
