The existing W246 generation B-Class has been around since the year 2011. Naturally then, the car is in need of bit of a revamp to match up with the times. Mercedes-Benz is onto just that with a facelifted version which is expected to debut at the 2014 Paris Motor Show.

Going by the spy images of the test mule dressed in light camouflage, Mercedes could be restricting the amount of updates to only the front and the rear-end of the upcoming B-Class. At the front, the MPV will feature a more upright grille and a redesigned bumper which could even get LED lamps. As for the rear, the only bit of update is the restyled exhaust pipe-end, also seen in the new C-Class.

Given that the existing B-Class is based on Mercedes¡¯ MFA platform, it is advanced enough to call for any mechanical updates just yet. Nonetheless, Mercedes is expected to introduce a new 1.6-litre, 4-cylinder diesel engine to replace the existing Renault-sourced 1.5-litre unit.

The B-Class facelift is expected to debut at the 2014 Paris Motor Show, followed by a global launch later in the year. Mercedes-Benz India could consider bringing it here soon after its global launch to enhance the appeal of the B-Class which caters to a niche segment here in India.
