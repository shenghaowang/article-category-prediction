An unidentified male Metro-North employee working on the tracks near East 106th Street and Park Avenue died after being struck by a Poughkeepsie-bound Hudson Line train at 12:47 a.m. on Monday. There are currently no details about the cause of the accident, which is just the latest incident in what has been a very bad year for the railroad, which has seen two major, fatal crashes, the death of a foreman on the tracks near West Haven, and a systemwide shutdown at rush hour.
