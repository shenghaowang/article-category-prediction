Symantec has fired president and chief executive Steve Bennett after less than two years on the job, as the world's largest maker of security software for PCs struggles with a shift to mobile devices.

The company named board member Michael Brown to lead while the company seeks Bennett's replacement.

A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, the company said on Thursday (Friday morning Australian time).

Bennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem's ousting in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record slump in PC sales curbs spending on Symantec's anti-virus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock has tumbled 15 per cent in the past year.

Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.
