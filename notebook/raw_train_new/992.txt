Men's Wearhouse will become the fourth-biggest U.S. men's clothing retailer.



Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers announced that they have entered into an agreement under which Men's Wearhouse will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Jos. A. Bank for $65 per share in cash or total consideration of $1.8 billion.

The Associated Press reported that the agreement ends negotiations that began in October when Jos. A. Bank offered to buy Men's Wearhouse for $2.3 billion. Men's Wearhouse turned down the offer offering to buy Jos. A. Bank for $1.54 billion. By early March Men's Wearhouse had an offer of $63.50 per share on the table but said it may raise the bid to $65 per share if some conditions were met. With the sale of Jos. A. Bank Clothiers to The Men's Wearhouse, the new company will have more than 1,700 stores and 23,000 employees.

Men's Warehouse has stores locally at the Paxton Towne Center in Lower Paxton Twp. and at the Capital City Mall in Lower Allen Twp. Jos. A. Bank has stores locally in Camp Hill and at the Shoppes at Susquehanna Marketplace in Susquehanna Twp.
