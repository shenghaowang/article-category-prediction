Regulators in various countries are grappling with bitcoin. What the hell is it? It's a good question and answers vary widely.

 

 Bloomberg reports Japan Says Bitcoin Not Currency Amid Calls for Regulation.

The answer to my question is yes, no, don't know, and it depends (dependent on what country you are in).

 

 Newsweek Unmasks Bitcoin Inventor

 

 Two day ago, Newsweek unmasked Satoshi Nakamoto, The Face Behind Bitcoin. It's a fascinating article, and one well worth a look.

 

 Here's a paragraph that caught my attention.

Followup Statement 

 

 Newsweek issued a followup statement in regards to the denials ... "Newsweek stands strongly behind Ms. Goodman and her article. Ms. Goodman¡¯s reporting was motivated by a search for the truth surrounding a major business story, absent any other agenda. The facts as reported point toward Mr. Nakamoto¡¯s role in the founding of Bitcoin."

 

 I believe Newsweek has it correct. Leah McGrath Goodman did a fantsatic job of investigative reporting.
