The central bank refocused its interest-rate policy, known as forward guidance, on spare capacity last month. The revamp came after unemployment fell faster than forecast toward the 7 percent threshold it set for considering a rate increase.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney today told MPs that the amount of spare capacity is ¡°at the upper end¡± of the 1 percent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product estimated by the BOE in its Inflation Report last month.

His comments underline a key area of divergence among officials, after policy maker Martin Weale said the level of slack may be overstated.
